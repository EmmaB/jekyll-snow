The biographical notes on the back cover— with the by now inevitable photo of Lint kissing a tortoise— stated that Lint had died in 1972. The media, poised to praise him after his death, sprang in with lamentations that he had been tragically neglected by commercial enterprise and that it was baffling that his artistic genius had not been more appreciated. Their bitter embarrassment upon learning that he was still alive and open to their patronage drove a bigger wedge than ever between the media and Lint— they had no recourse but to pretend he did not exist at all. ‘So in terms of money, publicity and ease of progress,’ Lint observed, ‘all remains the same.’\"</i>  <b>Jeff Lint</b> was author of some of the strangest and most inventive satirical SF of the twentieth century. He transcended genre in classics such as <i>Jelly Result</i> and <i>The Stupid Conversation</i>, becoming a cult figure and pariah. Like his contemporary Philip K.

Aylett follows Lint through his Beat days; his immersion in pulp SF, psychedelia and resentment; his disastrous scripts for <i>Star Trek</i> and <i>Patton</i>; the controversies of <i>The Caterer</i> comic and the scariest kids' cartoon ever aired; and his belated Hollywood success in the 1990s.

Aylett crams more ideas into one sentence than you’ll find in all the novels on the New York Times bestseller list put together.” -- <i>Bookmunch</i>  “[Aylett] is an unstoppable master of space and time—much like Lint himself.’Scifi.com“an elaborate and unhinged comedy, Lint offers a wide sweep of pulp/junk/underground culture... I love the part about Lint’s JFK conspiracy theory, which posits that the same bullet ricochet killed several presidents.” -- <i>LitKicks</i>  “This little book is a gem...What Steve Aylett has done is put together a very odd, sometimes nonsensical, but often laugh-out-loud funny mock biography of a pulp fiction writer who only exists in the author’s imagination. The section on Lint’s failed <i>Star Trek</i> script had me in tears, I was laughing so hard.” -- <i>Estella’s Revenge</i> ","isbns":"978-1-906727-88-8"},{"title":"The Sunny Side","isbn":"978-1-905005-38-3","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1905005385","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1905005385","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1905005385","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1905005385","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1905005385","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1905005385","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1905005385","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1905005385","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1905005385","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1905005385","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781905005383","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781905005383","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781905005383","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781905005383&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781905005383&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781905005383","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781905005383","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781905005383&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781905005383&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781905005383","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781905005383","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781905005383","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781905005383","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781905005383","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781905005383","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781905005383;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/1/206761/847/847_jpg_rgb_0650h.jpg","author":"A.A.

But Monad also makes the Red Men - tireless, intelligent, creative and entirely virtual corporate workers - and it's looking to expand the programme. So Nelson is put in charge of Redtown: a virtual city, inhabited by copies of real people going about their daily business, in which new policies, diseases and disasters can be studied in perfect simulation.\nNelson finds himself at the helm of a grand project whose goals appear increasingly authoritarian and potentially catastrophic. As the boundaries between Redtown and the real world become ever more brittle, and revolutionary factions begin to align themselves against the Red Men, Nelson finds himself forced to choose sides: Monad or his family, the corporation or the community, the real or the virtual. 'The Red Men' is at heart a novel about a character wrestling with his conscience, set against a pervasive and Orwellian vision of contemporary society: surveillance, automation, biotechnology, and their implications for our humanity.\n","reviews":null,"isbns":""},{"title":"City Cycling","isbn":"978-1-905005-60-4","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1905005601","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1905005601","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1905005601","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1905005601","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1905005601","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1905005601","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1905005601","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1905005601","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1905005601","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1905005601","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781905005604","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781905005604","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781905005604","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781905005604&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781905005604&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781905005604","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781905005604","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781905005604&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781905005604&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781905005604","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781905005604","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781905005604","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781905005604","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781905005604","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781905005604","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781905005604;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/1/206781/737/737_jpg_rgb_0650h.jpg","author":"Richard Ballantine","subject":17,"series":[14137],"pub_date":"2007-09-01","page_count":160,"usd_price":"19.95","gbp_price":"9.99","measurements":"↑ 25","blurb":"The legendary Richard Ballantine is back!

The lynchpin of his plan is Sifte Pierson, a child so gifted that he has gambled his entire future on her obedience.\nConfined at Institute 1, an isolated school which produces the most powerful minds and bodies to serve Solntse, Sifte has grown up without knowledge of her parents or the life she was stolen from. When a new teacher arrives with a dangerous agenda and clues to her past, Sifte and her closest friends uncover a secret history with the power to destroy Solntse's empire.\nWhen the secrets leak to the Socialist rebels in the slums of St. Petersburg, their dreams of revolution begin to take solid form. And as Sifte and her friends work to uncover Solntse's plans for Utopia, she comes to realize that her identity and future are vital not only to Russia's freedom, but to all humankind.","reviews":"'Its genius defies classification - too deep to be a thriller, too real to be sci-fi, too exciting to be satire and altogether too much fun to be literature.

Its people are ushering in a new era of technology, dazzled each day by new inventions. Airships soar in the skies over the city, whilst ground trains rumble through the streets and clockwork automatons are programmed to carry out menial tasks in the offices of lawyers, policemen and journalists. But beneath this shiny veneer of progress lurks a sinister side.

Was he killed in return for his part in clearing the Highlands of their people? Did a discarded lover take their final revenge?\nInspector Allerdyce and Sergeant McGillivray VC must find out before the killer strikes again. But their search, from the material heights of Victorian society to its moral dregs, threatens to overturn everything Allerdyce believes and loves.\n","reviews":"Publishers Weekly Lovers of well-written historicals will welcome Sim's first novel featuring Insp. Archibald Allerdyce and Sgt. Hector McGillivray, set in Scotland in 1865. When the duke of Dornoch vanishes, Allerdyce gets on the case, though he'd much rather look into \"the murders of ordinary men and women.\" After learning that the duke received a telegram on the date of his disappearance, the inspector discovers the nobleman's corpse in a well on his estate. Allerdyce finds himself under pressure to focus his efforts on a mine union leader, a rabble-rouser and admirer of Karl Marx, regarded as a threat by the establishment. Another murder presents Allerdyce with the prospect that the killer is someone close to him. Sim does a fine job in bringing the mean streets of Victorian Edinburgh to life. While experienced whodunit readers will guess the murderer's identity before the detective does, the absence of a pat resolution makes for a highly satisfying ending.

She was one of many, crowding around him. But he couldn't hear her. With the headgear he was wearing, Sergeant George Kelly couldn't hear what any of them were saying. They were all just muffled words. Muted. Censored. Like sounds you would hear under water. But he could see her talking, see her screaming. And he knew she was swearing. It was something about the way her lips were moving. Shaping the words as if they were heavy. Teeth showing. Almost growling rather than speaking. Or maybe laughing. Because, with every fuck-shaped word she mouthed, there was at least the hint of a smile. It didn't matter, of course. None of their words mattered to George when all he could hear was the rhythmic sound of his own breathing. A mechanical mish-mash of pumps and compression as sanitised air flowed, noisily, through rubber tubing into his facemask and lungs. Steady and dependable. Pure and uninfected. He felt a hand on his shoulder. Looking to the corner of his visor, he saw his constable, Norman Coulter, also in breathing apparatus, also fighting through the confused and excited crowd. Norman smiled, as if enjoying himself, rolling with the mob as if on some fairground ride. George knew it was just bravado, though. Maybe the big man was drinking on the job, again. Or maybe he had something even more taboo flooding through his system. George didn't care, though. Not now. He couldn't blame the poor bastard for taking the edge off, regardless of how he did it. In fact, he wished he'd had the wit to take a drink himself.","reviews":"\"One of the best new horror writers of the decade.

We’re told not to judge a book by its cover, but the covers of many PYR releases, and those by Jon Sullivan in particular, challenge our ability to reserve judgment. The image of a brassy looking automaton drawing a sword-cane to square off against a massive, patchwork-looking figure (a seemingly steampunk Kingpin), surrounded by spectral figures (steam wraiths!) in flight was too much to resist. Accordingly I set to work devouring <i>Spring Heeled Jack</i>, a phenomenal first novel deserving of the recently won Philip K. Dick award. As I said in my review of <i>Spring Heeled Jack</i><i></i>, if this is what the “punk” Hodder wants to see steampunk look like, then I say with Oliver Twist, “<i>Please</i>, sir, I want some <i>more</i>.”  And more there is. <i>The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man</i> is a worthy successor to <i>Spring Heeled Jack</i>, combining a number of seemingly clichéd steampunk elements in ways that shatter and rebuild them: the combination of industrial and biological sciences ala Westerfeld’s <i>Leviathan</i>; the filthy London of Gibson and Sterling’s <i>Difference Engine, </i>filled with anachronistic innovations; recursive fantasy blending both historical and literary figures as in Newman’s <i>Anno Dracula; </i>the Agent of the Crown, seen in Green’s <i>Pax Britannia </i>series; the labyrinthine schemes of secret societies in Dahlquist’s <i>The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters</i> and Tidhar’s <i>Camera Obscura</i>; multi-threaded plots akin to Powers’ <i>Anubis Gates</i>; and the quirky humor of Blaylock’s <i>Adventures of Langdon St. Ives</i>. Where these predecessors and contemporaries are inferior, Hodder elevates his material, and where they are masters of narrative, he matches them. The story defies summary, but the narrative centers upon Sir Richard Francis Burton and poet Algernon Swinburne’s investigation into a theft of black diamonds, ultimately embroiling them in the affairs of a dubious claimant, supposedly the heir of a cursed estate. As with <i>Anubis Gates</i>, this only scratches the surface of Hodder’s tale, as his secondary world-building is delightfully dense. Readers familiar with nineteenth century will enjoy the numerous changes Hodder has wrought, which take this simple plotline and render it complex.<i> The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man</i> clearly demontrates Hodder’s ability for making the vast elements of his secondary world cohere, live, and breathe, and to do it in a way that is deliciously entertaining.\" -- Steampunk Scholar ","isbns":"978-1-907777-02-8<br/>978-1-907777-43-1"},{"title":"The Martian Ambassador","isbn":"978-1-907777-08-0","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1907777083","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1907777083","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1907777083","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1907777083","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1907777083","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1907777083","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1907777083","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1907777083","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1907777083","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1907777083","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781907777080","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781907777080","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781907777080","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781907777080&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781907777080&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781907777080","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781907777080","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781907777080&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781907777080&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781907777080","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781907777080","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781907777080","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781907777080","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781907777080","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781907777080","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781907777080;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/1/216183/802/802_jpg_rgb_0650h.jpg","author":"Alan K Baker","subject":19,"series":[11659],"pub_date":"2011-03-01","page_count":320,"usd_price":"14.95","gbp_price":"7.99","measurements":"↑ 129","blurb":"WELCOME TO LONDON, 1899\nIt has been six years since the discovery of intelligent life on Mars, and relations between the two worlds are rapidly developing.

We’re told not to judge a book by its cover, but the covers of many PYR releases, and those by Jon Sullivan in particular, challenge our ability to reserve judgment. The image of a brassy looking automaton drawing a sword-cane to square off against a massive, patchwork-looking figure (a seemingly steampunk Kingpin), surrounded by spectral figures (steam wraiths!) in flight was too much to resist. Accordingly I set to work devouring <i>Spring Heeled Jack</i>, a phenomenal first novel deserving of the recently won Philip K. Dick award. As I said in my review of <i>Spring Heeled Jack</i><i></i>, if this is what the “punk” Hodder wants to see steampunk look like, then I say with Oliver Twist, “<i>Please</i>, sir, I want some <i>more</i>.”  And more there is. <i>The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man</i> is a worthy successor to <i>Spring Heeled Jack</i>, combining a number of seemingly clichéd steampunk elements in ways that shatter and rebuild them: the combination of industrial and biological sciences ala Westerfeld’s <i>Leviathan</i>; the filthy London of Gibson and Sterling’s <i>Difference Engine, </i>filled with anachronistic innovations; recursive fantasy blending both historical and literary figures as in Newman’s <i>Anno Dracula; </i>the Agent of the Crown, seen in Green’s <i>Pax Britannia </i>series; the labyrinthine schemes of secret societies in Dahlquist’s <i>The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters</i> and Tidhar’s <i>Camera Obscura</i>; multi-threaded plots akin to Powers’ <i>Anubis Gates</i>; and the quirky humor of Blaylock’s <i>Adventures of Langdon St. Ives</i>. Where these predecessors and contemporaries are inferior, Hodder elevates his material, and where they are masters of narrative, he matches them. The story defies summary, but the narrative centers upon Sir Richard Francis Burton and poet Algernon Swinburne’s investigation into a theft of black diamonds, ultimately embroiling them in the affairs of a dubious claimant, supposedly the heir of a cursed estate. As with <i>Anubis Gates</i>, this only scratches the surface of Hodder’s tale, as his secondary world-building is delightfully dense. Readers familiar with nineteenth century will enjoy the numerous changes Hodder has wrought, which take this simple plotline and render it complex.<i> The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man</i> clearly demontrates Hodder’s ability for making the vast elements of his secondary world cohere, live, and breathe, and to do it in a way that is deliciously entertaining.\" -- Steampunk Scholar ","isbns":"978-1-906727-99-4<br/>978-1-907777-43-1"},{"title":"The Martian Ambassador","isbn":"978-1-907777-10-3","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1907777105","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1907777105","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1907777105","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1907777105","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1907777105","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1907777105","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1907777105","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1907777105","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1907777105","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1907777105","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781907777103","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781907777103","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781907777103","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781907777103&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781907777103&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781907777103","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781907777103","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781907777103&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781907777103&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781907777103","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781907777103","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781907777103","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781907777103","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781907777103","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781907777103","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781907777103;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/1/216183/802/802_jpg_rgb_0650h.jpg","author":"Alan K Baker","subject":19,"series":[11659],"pub_date":"2011-03-01","page_count":356,"usd_price":"29.95","gbp_price":"19.99","measurements":"198 x 129 x 20","blurb":"WELCOME TO LONDON, 1899\nIt has been six years since the discovery of intelligent life on Mars, and relations between the two worlds are rapidly developing.

Along with Detective Gerhard de Chardin of the Metropolitan Templar Police and the famous occultist Simon Castaigne, Blackwood and Sophia plunge into a terrifying adventure which takes them from the dank tunnels of the London Underground to the depths of interstellar space and a dying planet known as Carcosa, where a horrific being from beyond the ordered universe has set its sights on Earth.\nThe being is known as the King in Yellow, or the Feaster from the Stars, and unless Blackwood and Sophia can prevail, it will descend upon the Earth and consume every living thing upon it!","reviews":null,"isbns":"978-1-907777-65-3<br/>978-1-907777-57-8"},{"title":"The Narrows","isbn":"978-1-907777-59-2","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1907777598","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1907777598","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1907777598","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1907777598","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1907777598","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1907777598","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1907777598","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1907777598","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1907777598","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1907777598","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781907777592","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781907777592","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781907777592","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781907777592&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781907777592&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781907777592","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781907777592","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781907777592&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781907777592&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781907777592","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781907777592","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781907777592","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781907777592","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781907777592","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781907777592","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781907777592;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/1/216181/809/809_jpg_rgb_0650h.jpg","author":"James Brogden","subject":19,"series":[12246],"pub_date":"2012-01-09","page_count":320,"usd_price":"14.95","gbp_price":"7.99","measurements":"↑ 129","blurb":" There are places where the skin of the world is thin. Here, miracles walk the streets, and nightmares haunt the alleyways.  Welcome to <b><i>the Narrows</i></b>.  Bex belongs to a hidden society of misfits, homeless, and runaways who live in the Narrows - the hidden paths that lie behind even the darkest of alleyways. For years they have lived invisibly alongside ordinary city-dwellers, with their own allegiances, their own dreams and deaths, loves and wars.  Except that the Narrows are closing, and nobody knows why, and the things that hunt them have begun to chase them onto the daylight streets.  Andy Sumner lives a perfectly conventional life, but a chance encounter with a wounded and pursued Bex leads him into a world where the very laws of space and time are malleable. But how much of his life is truly governed by chance? Why does he seem to be able to control the Narrows? And what secrets were inscribed in the energy meridians of his own flesh by the dark figure that now hunts them both?  The search for answers will take Andy and Bex far beyond the spheres of reality that either of them have known, and to a confrontation with evil upon which hangs the fate of an infinity of possible worlds.

On the same day that 15 year old Zar Punkstar qualifies as a Pro Leaguer, he finds his inventor father murdered, and a clue -- a Paranascope scroll containing a holographic map of the city. An encounter with the mysterious race promoter, Braxton Earl, leads him to enter the city’s infamous Ramrod Rally, a series of races, obstacle courses and death traps in Autodrome’s notorious outer suburbs, The Eras. His team mates include fellow racer and number one crush, Raina Jubilique, and a group of jaded ex-Pro Leaguers who'd sooner stab each other in the back as race together. His opposition are a mixed bag of polished Pro Leaguers, hired thugs, and parts' pirates. But who to trust in a world of competitors? And for a champion like Zar, is the ultimate prize to win the Ramrod or outwit a killer?","reviews":"Brought up on the rough side of town, Zar Punkstar's one chance to shine is racing jacked-up retro automobiles through the streets of Autodrome. Securing a place in the legendary Ramrod Rally should have been his ultimate dream, but the murder of his mysterious father and his junky mother's overdose, not to mention the mysterious team manager, the thugs on his tail and his fighting team-mates, put him at the centre of an off-beat mystery adventure like no other. The backdrop is a strangely steampunk future, a city like something out of Metropolis but full of steam technology and clockwork gadgets revolving around the motor industry and a population whose only relief is an obsession with cars and rallying. What lifts this oddball setting out of the ordinary is Lakin-Smith's deft prose, from the loving depiction of the city and its inhabitants to powerfully emotional set-piece scenes. In lots of waysAutodrome is a conventional quest story for grease monkeys, but the characterisation and careful realisation of the city make this far more than a steampunk adventure romp for Top Gear fans.","isbns":"978-1-909679-04-7<br/>978-1-909679-58-0"},{"title":"Resurrection Engines","isbn":"978-1-907777-84-4","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1907777849","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1907777849","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1907777849","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1907777849","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1907777849","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1907777849","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1907777849","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1907777849","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1907777849","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1907777849","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781907777844","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781907777844","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781907777844","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781907777844&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781907777844&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781907777844","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781907777844","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781907777844&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781907777844&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781907777844","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781907777844","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781907777844","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781907777844","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781907777844","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781907777844","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781907777844;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"16 Extraordinary Tales of Scientific Romance","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/1/207299/6140/6140_jpg_rgb_0650h.jpg","author":"Jim Mortimore, Jonathan Green, Palmer, Paul Magrs, Kim Lakin-Smith, Roland Moore, Alison Littlewood, Simon Bucher-Jones, Juliet E.

Airships ply the skies and Queen Victoria presides over three-quarters of the known world—including the East Coast of America, following the failed revolution of 1775.\n \nLondon might as well be a world away from Sandsend, a tiny village on the Yorkshire coast. Gideon Smith dreams of the adventure promised him by the lurid tales of Captain Lucian Trigger, the Hero of the Empire, told in Gideon’s favourite “penny dreadful.” When Gideon’s father is lost at sea in highly mysterious circumstances Gideon is convinced that supernatural forces are at work.  Deciding only Captain Lucian Trigger himself can aid him, Gideon sets off for London. On the way he rescues the mysterious mechanical girl Maria from a tumbledown house of shadows and iniquities. Together they make for London, where Gideon finally meets Captain Trigger.\n \nBut Trigger is little more than an ageing fraud, providing cover for the covert activities of his lover, Dr. John Reed, a privateer and sometime agent of the British Crown.

These are heavyweight comparisons so early in a writer's career; a testament to the kind of talent and imagination on offer here. If you like fantasy and yearn for an intelligent, meaningful new voice, dip your toes into the turquoise waters of Tourmaline.

On the same day that 15 year old Zar Punkstar qualifies as a Pro Leaguer, he finds his inventor father murdered, and a clue -- a Paranascope scroll containing a holographic map of the city. An encounter with the mysterious race promoter, Braxton Earl, leads him to enter the city’s infamous Ramrod Rally, a series of races, obstacle courses and death traps in Autodrome’s notorious outer suburbs, The Eras. His team mates include fellow racer and number one crush, Raina Jubilique, and a group of jaded ex-Pro Leaguers who'd sooner stab each other in the back as race together. His opposition are a mixed bag of polished Pro Leaguers, hired thugs, and parts' pirates. But who to trust in a world of competitors? And for a champion like Zar, is the ultimate prize to win the Ramrod or outwit a killer?","reviews":"Brought up on the rough side of town, Zar Punkstar's one chance to shine is racing jacked-up retro automobiles through the streets of Autodrome. Securing a place in the legendary Ramrod Rally should have been his ultimate dream, but the murder of his mysterious father and his junky mother's overdose, not to mention the mysterious team manager, the thugs on his tail and his fighting team-mates, put him at the centre of an off-beat mystery adventure like no other. The backdrop is a strangely steampunk future, a city like something out of Metropolis but full of steam technology and clockwork gadgets revolving around the motor industry and a population whose only relief is an obsession with cars and rallying. What lifts this oddball setting out of the ordinary is Lakin-Smith's deft prose, from the loving depiction of the city and its inhabitants to powerfully emotional set-piece scenes. In lots of waysAutodrome is a conventional quest story for grease monkeys, but the characterisation and careful realisation of the city make this far more than a steampunk adventure romp for Top Gear fans.","isbns":"978-1-907777-83-7<br/>978-1-909679-58-0"},{"title":"The Pendragon Protocol","isbn":"978-1-909679-17-7","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1909679178","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1909679178","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1909679178","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1909679178","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1909679178","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1909679178","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1909679178","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1909679178","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1909679178","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1909679178","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781909679177","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781909679177","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781909679177","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781909679177&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781909679177&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781909679177","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781909679177","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781909679177&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781909679177&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781909679177","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781909679177","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781909679177","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781909679177","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781909679177","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781909679177","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781909679177;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/1/215699/11960/11960_jpg_rgb_0650h.jpg","author":"Philip Purser-Hallard","subject":19,"series":[12008],"pub_date":"2014-07-01","page_count":416,"usd_price":"14.95","gbp_price":"7.99","measurements":"198 x 129","blurb":"The Circle are the modern-day successors of the Knights of the Round Table.

The legends of King Arthur are not the only stories with influence on the British psyche – and some of the others have their own, very different agendas.\n  A smart, contemporary political thriller and a new kind of urban fantasy, <i>The Pendragon Protocol</i> is the first volume in <i>The Devices Trilogy.

What if we were the 'evil' of mythology, and it was designed to keep us in, rather than something out... What if someone had found the Fountain of Youth or the secret of Immortality? But it was far from the ultimate gift that we have been lead to believe. What if it meant that you would still age, still deteriorate, still rot, but you would just keep on living for ever and ever...Who exactly were the Magi? What if their journey was actually to stop something from being 'born' on our world? What if the child wasn't from Heaven at all, but from another planet?\n\nThere’s an almost inexhaustible supply of items, objects, stories and creatures that have been handed down to us through history and have become lodged in our social consciousness – the Ark of the Covenant, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Stone Circles, the Fingerprints of the Gods (Alien Intervention), Atlantis…\n\nSome of today's finest horror writers use ancient mythology, legends and biblical icons as their starting point in this extraordinary horror collection.","reviews":null,"isbns":""},{"title":"Beside the

Half a continent home to grotesques, monsters and madmen. Between it and civilisation stands Westwatch and the men and women of the Department for Research into Advanced Weaponry – the agents of D.R.A.W. – who are about to have a very bad day.

Runaway trains, besieged airships, raging river rafts and a gunfight with an army of the dead – with, if they’re lucky, a whisky, in between – are just a few challenges they’ll face before unlocking the secret of the Altered States, buried deep beneath the earth in one of the Seven Cities of Old ...

The mighty mechanical brass dragon Apep and its unique pilot, Maria, a clockwork woman with the brain of a London shop girl, were stolen away by turncoat Louis Cockayne and last sighted south of the Mason-Dixon Wall. The search brings Gideon and his crew to gritty San Antonio, Tex.—aka Steamtown—where ruthless Thaddeus Pinch, “more machine than man,” has nefarious plans for the dragon, as soon as he can learn how to control it. Meanwhile, in Nyu Edo on the west coast of North America, a scientist prepares a secret weapon to fight a runaway from Monster Island. Barnett’s characters are drawn with broad strokes, and the many subplots make for a bumpy pace, but there’s plenty to enjoy in this gleeful mix of brass goggles, sword-wielding swashbucklers, Darwin, and dinosaurs.  -- Publishers Weekly","isbns":"978-1-909679-32-0<br/>978-1-909679-33-7"},{"title":"Gideon Smith and the Mask of the Ripper","isbn":"978-1-909679-55-9","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1909679550","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1909679550","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1909679550","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1909679550","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1909679550","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1909679550","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1909679550","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1909679550","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1909679550","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1909679550","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781909679559","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781909679559","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781909679559","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781909679559&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781909679559&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781909679559","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781909679559","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781909679559&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781909679559&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781909679559","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781909679559","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781909679559","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781909679559","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781909679559","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781909679559","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781909679559;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/1/225059/13290/13290_jpg_rgb_0650h.jpg","author":"David Barnett","subject":19,"series":[11869],"pub_date":"2015-10-13","page_count":416,"usd_price":"15.95","gbp_price":"8.99","measurements":"198 x 129","blurb":"The real identity of Jack the Ripper revealed at last?

For the city is on the edge of mass rioting due to the continuing reign of terror by the serial killer known only as Jack the Ripper, who is rampaging though London's less salubrious quarters. While chasing the madman, a villain from their past strips Gideon Smith of his memory and is cast adrift in the seedy underbelly of London, where life is tough and death lurks in every shadowy alley. With mob rule threatening to engulf London, the Empire has never needed its hero more...but where is Gideon Smith?  Gideon Smith and the Mask of the Ripper is the latest in David Barnett's riproaring steampunk adventures about a Britain that never was...but should have been. ","reviews":null,"isbns":"978-1-909679-75-7"},{"title":"Whispers in the Dark","isbn":"978-1-909679-30-6","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1909679305","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1909679305","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1909679305","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1909679305","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1909679305","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1909679305","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1909679305","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1909679305","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1909679305","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1909679305","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781909679306","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781909679306","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781909679306","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781909679306&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781909679306&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781909679306","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781909679306","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781909679306&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781909679306&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781909679306","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781909679306","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781909679306","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781909679306","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781909679306","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781909679306","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781909679306;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"A Cthulhu Anthology","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/1/221153/11964/11964_jpg_rgb_0650h.jpg","author":"Edited by Scott Harrison and Alison Littlewood, Johnny Mains, and Thana Niveau","subject":16,"series":[14133],"pub_date":"2015-02-16","page_count":416,"usd_price":"15.95","gbp_price":"8.99","measurements":"198 x 129","blurb":"Three CTHULHU novellas, by today's leading horror writers, set throughout the twentieth century.  <b>One Nameless Thing</b> by Alison Littlewood, set in the Maldives in the present day.  <b>The Gamekeeper</b> by Johnny Mains set in Scotland in the 1940s &amp;

Maria is the only one who can pilot the beast, so Cockayne has taken girl and dragon off to points east.Gideon and his intrepid band take to the skies and travel to the American colonies hot on Cockayne’s trail. Not only does Gideon want the machine back, he has fallen in love with Maria. Their journey will take them to the wilds of the lawless lands south of the American colonies—to free Texas, where the mad King of Steamtown rules with an iron fist (literally), where life is cheap and honor even cheaper.Does Gideon have what it takes to not only save the day but win the girl?","reviews":"Gideon Smith, a newly minted Hero of the Empire (following the events of Gideon Smith and the Mechanical Girl), heads off to Britain-controlled America to recover a lost dragon and its clockwork-cyborg pilot in this fast-paced and pulpy steampunk adventure. The mighty mechanical brass dragon Apep and its unique pilot, Maria, a clockwork woman with the brain of a London shop girl, were stolen away by turncoat Louis Cockayne and last sighted south of the Mason-Dixon Wall. The search brings Gideon and his crew to gritty San Antonio, Tex.—aka Steamtown—where ruthless Thaddeus Pinch, “more machine than man,” has nefarious plans for the dragon, as soon as he can learn how to control it. Meanwhile, in Nyu Edo on the west coast of North America, a scientist prepares a secret weapon to fight a runaway from Monster Island. Barnett’s characters are drawn with broad strokes, and the many subplots make for a bumpy pace, but there’s plenty to enjoy in this gleeful mix of brass goggles, sword-wielding swashbucklers, Darwin, and dinosaurs.  -- Publishers Weekly","isbns":"978-1-909679-31-3<br/>978-1-909679-32-0"},{"title":"Shakespeare Vs.

A world that never was. At least in our universe… \nA place where upway trains glide between the skyscrapers and the subway system has long been abandoned to the hideous creatures that dwell beneath the Earth’s surface. A place where Cavorite-powered aircraft soar among the clouds, watched by the sky beasts that inhabit the upper atmosphere. A place where the supernatural is real, and the organised crime of New York is run by Johnny Sanguine, the Vampire King of Brooklyn. \nHumanity’s first expedition to Mars has ended with the triumphant return of Rocketship X-M, bearing priceless artefacts from a long-dead civilisation. When the obsidian statuette known as the Martian Falcon is stolen from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Al Capone, the cybernetically-enhanced “Diesel-powered Gangster”, is in the frame for the heist. Capone, however, is innocent (for once), and suspects that the Falcon was stolen by Johnny Sanguine in an effort to move in on his Chicago territory. \nTo prove it, Capone enlists the unwilling help of Charles Fort, private investigator and anomalist. Fort uncovers something far more dangerous than an impending turf war between two gangsters: he uncovers a mystery that stretches back five million years to the destruction of the ancient Martian civilisation, and a timeless evil that could put an end to all life on Earth. \nOne thing’s for certain: Fort has his work cut out trying to prove Capone’s innocence while staying out of the firing line of Sanguine and his vampires. Now may not have been the best time to take on a new research assistant, a struggling writer by the name of H. P. Lovecraft… \nWelcome to a yesterday that never was.

The Circle, the UK paramilitary agency whose Knights carry the devices of the members of King Arthur’s Round Table, is hunting the Green Chapel, eco-activists allied to Robin Hood’s Merry Men. For the Knights, this quest is personal as well as political: the Chapel’s leader, Jory Taylor, is himself an errant Knight – and he has stolen the Holy Grail from the British Museum.  But this war is fought with modern weapons, and nowhere – from the Circle’s Thameside fortress to a Bristol squat, from the oldest pub in England to a music festival in Cheshire – will remain untouched.  Before long, the enmity between its greatest heroes will tear Britain apart.","reviews":null,"isbns":"978-1-909679-43-6"},{"title":"Tomorrow Never Knows","isbn":"978-1-909679-44-3","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1909679445","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1909679445","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1909679445","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1909679445","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1909679445","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1909679445","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1909679445","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1909679445","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1909679445","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1909679445","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781909679443","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781909679443","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781909679443","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781909679443&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781909679443&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781909679443","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781909679443","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781909679443&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781909679443&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781909679443","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781909679443","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781909679443","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781909679443","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781909679443","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781909679443","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781909679443;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/1/219268/19810/19810_jpg_rgb_0650h.jpg","author":"Eddie Robson","subject":19,"series":[14140],"pub_date":"2015-07-01","page_count":416,"usd_price":"14.95","gbp_price":"7.99","measurements":"198 x 129","blurb":" The city of Loreto, hanging in the atmosphere of Jupiter, has seen better days as a trading port. By the late 22nd century, it's become a hive of borderline illegal activity, but also a magnet for bohemian types from across the Jupiter colonies.  Ashton Lang, a psychically gifted scholarship student from Europa, is looking forward to spending her summer working in the city - until her only friend there, struggling artist Winter DeMattis, receives a grant and disappears off to Io, leaving Ashton to fend for herself. Winter is on Io to research a dull public commission, but the trip will change her life irrevocably.  Meanwhile Magic Alex – a minister in a church which worships The Beatles – is trying to find who has framed him for the murder of his blackmailer, a quest which brings him into contact with artificial savant Tomas Darrell. Tomas is new in town after losing his job on Callisto, but in Loreto he finds a new purpose: proving his suspicion that the entire city is doomed.

One that stands some chance, at least, of outliving him.","reviews":null,"isbns":"978-1-911390-84-8"},{"title":"The Goddess Project","isbn":"978-1-911390-22-0","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1911390228","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1911390228","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1911390228","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1911390228","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1911390228","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1911390228","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1911390228","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1911390228","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1911390228","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1911390228","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781911390220","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781911390220","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781911390220","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781911390220&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781911390220&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781911390220","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781911390220","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781911390220&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781911390220&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781911390220","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781911390220","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781911390220","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781911390220","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781911390220","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781911390220","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781911390220;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/1/250806//_jpg_rgb_0650h.jpg","author":"Bryan Wigmore","subject":19,"series":[14140],"pub_date":"2017-01-02","page_count":520,"usd_price":"15.95","gbp_price":"8.99","measurements":"198 x 129","blurb":" ‘Ancient terror, modern error, future era.’ Otter shook himself. ‘Mean much to you?’  Two years after being washed up on a remote beach, freedivers Orc and Cass still have no idea who they are or where they came from. Worst of all, they feel like lovers but look like brother and sister, and must repress their instincts for fear of committing a terrible mistake.  Now at last they’ve tracked down a psychic artefact powerful enough to restore their memories. But others also seek its forbidden magic. To reach it, deep within a sunken ruin, they must flirt with a ruthless occult conspiracy, one intent on summoning an ancient goddess to destroy the dreadnoughts of the Empyreal fleet.  The depths of the sea, of the past, of the world’s collective mind: down there are truths, but also madness and despair. And a power that will plunge the world back to a new dark age, if it can’t be stopped. ","reviews":" \"In the end, it's one of my best reads so far this year.\" -- Brian G.

The biographical notes on the back cover— with the by now inevitable photo of Lint kissing a tortoise— stated that Lint had died in 1972. The media, poised to praise him after his death, sprang in with lamentations that he had been tragically neglected by commercial enterprise and that it was baffling that his artistic genius had not been more appreciated. Their bitter embarrassment upon learning that he was still alive and open to their patronage drove a bigger wedge than ever between the media and Lint— they had no recourse but to pretend he did not exist at all. ‘So in terms of money, publicity and ease of progress,’ Lint observed, ‘all remains the same.’\"</i>  <b>Jeff Lint</b> was author of some of the strangest and most inventive satirical SF of the twentieth century. He transcended genre in classics such as <i>Jelly Result</i> and <i>The Stupid Conversation</i>, becoming a cult figure and pariah. Like his contemporary Philip K. Dick, he was blithely ahead of his time.  Aylett follows Lint through his Beat days; his immersion in pulp SF, psychedelia and resentment; his disastrous scripts for <i>Star Trek</i> and <i>Patton</i>; the controversies of <i>The Caterer</i> comic and the scariest kids' cartoon ever aired; and his belated Hollywood success in the 1990s.  It was a career haunted by death, including the undetected death of his agent, the suspicious death of his rival Herzog, and the unshakable \"Lint is dead\" rumors, which persisted even after his death.

I love the part about Lint’s JFK conspiracy theory, which posits that the same bullet ricochet killed several presidents.” -- <i>LitKicks</i>  “This little book is a gem...What Steve Aylett has done is put together a very odd, sometimes nonsensical, but often laugh-out-loud funny mock biography of a pulp fiction writer who only exists in the author’s imagination.

Having been meticulously arranged to ensure the moment of death is just as he wants it, the still-living body of his victim lands squarely on a heavy golden cross placed at the very bottom of the gaping valley.  Before the police have had a chance to learn of this elaborate death, Dr. Valentine has struck again.

An outspoken opponent of globalization and fascinated in Arthurian lore, Frost’s old comrade is the target of agents of the New World Order, a shadowy conspiracy trying to prevent him from finding the Crocea Mors, the sword of Caesar, and perhaps the very blade that King Arthur pulled from the stone to win his kingdom.  Frost is sceptical, most of what Denison claims strikes him as bullshit, plain and simple, but there's no denying that someone is trying to kill him.  So he's going to help. No matter the risk. That's just who he is.  Across London, Sir Charles Wyndham, leader of the Ogmios Team, dispatches Konstantin Khavin to learn the truth behind the attempted assassination… only to discover that the British government wants Denison dead at all costs. And because Frost is with him, Sir Charles is forced to make a choice—abandon Frost, or lose Ogmios for good.  It's not a choice he ever wanted to make, but he's going to have to cut Frost loose.

He's the behind-the-scenes technical whizzkid who makes it possible for the Ogmios Special Ops to operate effectively. Sir Charles Wyndham's covert team relies on Lethe for vital mission data, access to protected systems, real-time surveillance and for covering their tracks. Without him, Ogmios would cease to function.  Now an old friend of Wyndham's, Professor Camila Morais, needs help. Her search for a lost Inca city stalls when key members of her team are kidnapped from Lima airport. A reluctant Lethe is dispatched to provide technical help, with Noah Larkin as his bodyguard.  But Professor Morais is not the only one eager to find the secret city hidden deep within the Andes. An old terrorist organization is about to reveal it is anything but extinct. The Shining Path have returned, and their plans will have a profound and deadly effect on Peru, the continent, and the world.  With Noah missing and no way to call for backup, the only ones who can stop the terrorists are the granddaughter of a Nazi war criminal and a nerdy British hacker, whose skills may provide his enemies with the greatest weapon of all.  Jude Lethe is not a field agent, but he'll have to step up fast to prevent the deaths of millions.

Forced into time off from the Ogmios Team, she finds herself in unfamiliar territory: vacationing with civilians in the Peloponnese.  A late night encounter with a handsome stranger offers her a glimpse into a side of life she has never allowed herself to imagine: normalcy, freedom, love. But old secrets refuse to stay buried and when the ship is exhumed, her vacation takes a drastic turn.   With the help of fellow team member, Jude Lethe, Orla embarks on an adventure that will return her to the myths of old in which the unthinkable is made real and the horrors of man’s resolve threaten to seal the doom of humanity.

claim to have come from within the earth. The local legend states that the boy died, and the girl married but had no children. Is the legend true?  OCD sufferers often perpetuate their rituals believing that if they fail to do so their families will suffer.

Frank Baum, and the Dieselpunk aesthetic movement. Anybody who has read and played Alice's Nightmare in Wonderland will have a very clear idea of what to expect!","reviews":"Amazon: \"I've played a few of Jonathans books such as Howl Of The Werewolf and Alice's Nightmare in Wonderland so I knew this book would be well written. The first thing that strikes you is just how big the book is. It's a whopping 850 sections long. No wonder though, seeing as you can play through the book as any of the 6 characters! I've played through as Dorothy, The Lion and The Tin Woodman so far and each story varies more than enough to make playing through the book as each character worth while.
