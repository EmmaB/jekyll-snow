			<h3>Our wonderful books</h3>
			<p>Over the last fifteen years, we've published books that have sold in the tens of thousands. We've also published books that have only sold a handful of copies. But we have taken a searing pride in each and every one of them. And we have been a foundry for emerging talent. <a href="http://www.paulabrackston.com/">Paula Brackston</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mann_(writer)">George Mann</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hodder">Mark Hodder</a>, <a href="http://finalbullet.com/">Leila Johnston</a>, <a href="http://jamesbrogden.blogspot.co.uk/">James Brogden</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_De_Abaitua">Matthew De Abaitua</a> and more found their first home at Snowbooks, going on to become leading lights in the next generation of genre authors.</p>
