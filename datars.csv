I won't name names (because mine would be at the top of the list), but whoever keeps forgetting to make backups is responsible for our past posts going missing.  Everybody likes a fresh start, right?

We finally switched hosting companies, following recurring downtimes due to the  lackadaisical approach our old guys seemed to take regarding problem-fixin'.  The site should be back on its feet now -- possibly improved (did you notice the tweaked design?), but a few blog entries short of its former glory.  

At any rate, these are the successes I'm currently focusing on:

I'd love to give our proofs (which are printed and bound here in our office, by our very hands) custom printed covers on coloured card.  It seems novel and a bit 'let's hear it for antiquated technology!' at the moment, but I'm sure to go overboard and fill the office with letterpressed goods.  I need to find an old tray of wingbats with a snowflake.  Then we'll be made.</p></li>

"40682","","1","Maple Academy","Publish","true","There has been a flurry of letters this last week from hopeful would-be proofreaders. This happens about four times a year, in correlation, I'm guessing, with the end of a distance-learning proofreading course from one Maple Academy. They appear to have Snowbooks' details on a mailing list, and although I've asked to be removed they still appear to be telling their graduates to ask us for a role. 

One of the things that makes working at Snowbooks enjoyable is that we keep everything in-house, including proofreading. It's a waste of your time and effort to ask us if we need a freelance proofreader. (It's my own personal opinion that signing up for a distance-learning course in proofreading is not the best use of anyone's time or money.)

I'm sorry that we don't have any opportunities available. If you're thinking of going on a proofreading course, I'd strongly suggest talking to some previous graduates to hear their opinion of its usefulness.","","","","","2005-11-07","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","14"

Landis, the acclaimed author of the bestselling <a href=http://www.snowbooks.com/longing.html><i>Longing</i></a>. Set in the very real, but now vanished, location of Swift River Valley in Massachusetts, which was flooded to make a reservoir in the 1930s, this stunning gothic novel tells of the events following the young, imaginative Sarianna's arrival in the home of Reverend Jeremy Treat, a man of deep and rich faith trying to hold together a scattering congregation.

<i>The Valley</i> has just gone off to print, and to celebrate the lead up to publication on January 2nd, we've launched a special, dedicated website, where you can read an extract from the book, an interview with the author, and find out more about the extraordinary background to this tale. It's all <a href=http://www.snowbooks.com/thevalley>right here</a>.

Our second piece of news is the release of the cover for Bruce Benderson's memoir <i>The Romanian</i>, due for publication in May. Already published in France to great acclaim, where it became the first book by a non-French author to win the prestigious Prix de Flore, and shortly to be published by Penguin in the US, Snowbooks is proud to be publishing this landmark work by a truly extraordinary writer.

I promised you an urn, and an urn you've got. See how sizeable it is - note the festive Snowbooks gingerbread house used in the photo for scale. 

Actually, it's quite a diminutive urn - I only got a runner up prize at the Everywoman Awards yesterday. However, Fiona Bruce (for it was she who presented the awards) read a bit out about Snowbooks and sounded very impressed. A man on the table next to ours (it was at the Savoy over lunch, with 300 important-looking guests) harrumphed in an impressed way too. I made sure that it said in my profile which she read out that we couldn't have done it all without Waterstone's; although they'll never know it, it makes me feel good to thank them publicly.  

The lunch was also an opportunity for people to give to Refuge, the domestic violence charity. 1 in 4 women is the subject of domestic violence, can you believe, and the lunch raised 3000 for their cause, which was excellent. 

The overall winner was Elaine Fairfax from Animal Friends Insurance who was a very worthy winner.

"40692","","1","Official: Snowbooks understand Forster's plan","Publish","true","Every now and again I google 'Snowbooks', naturally. Usually I'm asked whether I actually meant 'Snowboots'. Sigh. Maybe we should diversify. 

It's very nice, anyway, when an unexpected and splendid thing pops up in the search results, like this review of The Celestial Omnibus by E M Forster. We think our Signature collection books - pretty, collectable hardbacks of neglected literary works, of which the Forster is one - are gorgeous, which makes up for their relatively modest sales. It's nice to hear that this reviewer believes Forster would have liked them, too: 

""This new edition of Forster's The Celestial Omnibus is recommendable to every Forsterite, to every bibliophile and to everybody who wants or has to read Forster's stories. Some people will probably have to get a critical edition from the library to accompany the reading, but if they do not, they can open their hearts as well as their minds. The result of such a reading could be more revealing and inspiring, but definitely, it would be closer to the intention of the author. Snowbooks have understood Forster's plan.""

I've got to say, I wouldn't have dreamed of trying deliberately to second-guess Forster, but heck - the opinion of someone who goes to the bother of maintaining a site just about their favourite author must be worth something.

Read the full review:","The first story of the collection is The Story of a Panic. It was the first story Forster ever wrote, and the circumstances of its creation remained vividly with him as long as he lived. It was written with the help of a genius loci: Forster received the first part of the story while taking a walk near Ravello/Italy in May 1902. Interestingly, the last story of the collection is the second of three instances of the effects of a genius loci in Forsters entire oeuvre. Reading these stories is a revealing experience. We get to know a young and a fresh author, much as in his gay short stories of The Life to Come. There does not seem to be a filter in between the heart of the author and the text as we can read it. Dry Forster was said to be, the maiden aunt of English literature, leaving behind him an ephemeral impression only. The reason, some people argue, might have been that he did not want to include too many hints towards his very self in his texts. However, this happedif it happened at allonly with the texts he composed in a creative struggle. These short stories were created in a different way: they came to Forster naturally; he did not have to look for them.

In most of the stories of this collection, the author adapts themes from the classics or introduces classical characters to the English landscape. In Other Kingdom, he tells us the story of a woman who escapes her hopeless situation by becoming a dryad of her own wood. In The Road from Colonus, Forster echoes the tragedy of Oedipus and Antigone in the story of Ethel and her father Mr. Lucas, an old man who wants to die a dramatic death in Greece. Unlike Oedipus, he is rescued by his daughter, but actually diminished fatally by her.

Traditionally, editorial notes help the readers of such stories to understand all the interrelations to the classics, to literary theory or to the life of the author. Not in this edition. Following closely the Sidgwick and Jackson edition of 1924 but leaving out the original dedication To the Memory of the Independent Review, this book comes with the texts only. Is this a good idea?, one may ask. With this collection having been out of print for years, one had expected some critical edition, not such a beautiful book. The square format and the artistic cover hint at such a beautiful rather than a critical edition. So does the layout: the curved initials, the font, the endpaper.

The cover story is a parable about reading and feeling. The Celestial Omnibus takes a boy and a well-read but emotionally mutilated man to heaven. On their strange journey, the two meet characters from mythology and literature. While the man recognizes them with his mind, the boy experiences them with his heart. In the end, the boy arrives in heaven, whereas the man fails and ends up not only emotionally but also physically mutilated. Only the boy was able to connect the mind with the heart. How shall we read the classicsor literature in generalthen? This is what teachers ask after having read the story with their pupils. With enthusiasm and an open heart. This is the answer pupils ought to give, but still people have to rely on dusty old textbooks or much too critical editions of Forster. Here we have an edition which speaks to the heart. We have a book which looks beautiful, which does not smell of cheap adhesive and which does not look as if the author was only read in classrooms nowadays. This book enables us to read Forster without thinking of all the secondary literature and the history and the things teachers once told us.

This new edition of Forsters The Celestial Omnibus is recommendable to every Forsterite, to every bibliophile and to everybody who wants or has to read Forsters stories. Some people will probably have to get a critical edition from the library to accompany the reading, but if they do not, they can open their hearts as well as their minds. The result of such a reading could be more revealing and inspiring, but definitely, it would be closer to the intention of the author. Snowbooks have understood Forsters plan.

<blockquote>The Romanian is Romulus, a 24-year-old street hustler picked up in Budapest by Benderson, a fiftysomething Jewish-American journalist. Both, disaffected by cultural exploitation and erotic disorientation, acquiesce in an unsafe, self-deceiving sexual relationship. Benderson's uncontrolled mid-life crisis finds romantic adventure and obsessive focus in his unrequited passion for Romulus, through whom he discovers the chaotic contradictions of a Romania struggling from gothic isolation into global opportunity. This lush, lurid, lyrical, lacerating, sweetly unrepentant memoir won the Prix de Flore.</blockquote>","","","","","2006-05-08","2013-03-29","","","","","0"

We are extremely pleased to announce that Snowbooks was last night named Small Publisher of the Year at the British Book Awards, in a joint award with fellow publishers Profile. Emma, Gilly, Anna and James all attended the ceremony and rushed the stage en masse to collect the award. Only Gilly fell over.

In just three years, Snowbooks has gone from a two-person start-up to a four-person team, with a growing list and over 90,000 books sold. We are passionate about all our titles and believe that our innovative approach to the publishing process shows through in our work. We are very glad and very proud that this has been recognised by our peers.

Of course, none of this would have happened without the generous support of our authors, the book retailers, the trade press, and our fellow publishers. We offer heartfelt congratulations to our fellow Small Publisher winner, Profile books, and to all the other winners and nominees.

...This is one of our favourite things. <em>The Death Artist</em> is here! Already available from WHSmiths, and shortly from all other booksellers, <em>The Death Artist</em> is the must-read thriller of the summer. We've got some great promotions for it coming soon too: check back in the next few weeks for details!

From the blurb: ""A killer is preying on New York's art community, creating gruesome depictions of famous paintings, using human flesh and blood as his media. Terror stalks this world of genius, greed, inspiration, and jealousy -- a world Kate McKinnon knows all too well. A former NYPD cop who traded in her badge for a Ph.D in art history, Kate can see the method behind the psychopath's madness -- for the grisly slaughter of a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; is drawing her into the predator's path. And as each new murder exceeds the last in savagery, Kate is trapped in the twisted obsessions of the death artist, who plans to use her body, her blood, and her fear to create the ultimate masterpiece.""

<em>The Death Artist</em> is the UK debut from acclaimed author and internationally-exhibited artist, <a href=""http://www.jonathansantlofer.com/"">Jonathan Santlofer</a>.","","","","","2006-06-12","2013-03-29","","","","","0"
"40714","","1","One of the things I love about publishing is...","Publish","true","... that it provides a lovely balance between the satisfaction of long term planning and short term delights. I love planning; dreaming up our wildest ideas and having the time and space to think about how we could make them real. I love knowing 12 months in advance exactly where we're headed. It means that once the basic structure's in place, we can tweak and add and innovate and respond to what the market wants up to the time of publication, with no nasty last minute scrabbling around to do all the basics. And at the other end of the spectrum I love the flexibility that being little (the company, not me) encourages. It tickles me that we can have an idea and do something about it that very day. For example, we have an old nipping press and a guillotine in the office, and if we get a submission in that shows promise, I can quickly typeset it (takes about five mins thanks to InDesign's autoflow function), print it on our duplex printer (on xerox recycled paper which has the unintentional benefit of looking like 53gsm bulky news), trim the spine side, slather with binders' glue and squash (nip?) in the nipping press. Once the glue is dried, I trim the remaining three sides, fold a card cover round it, draw a cover design in biro and hey presto, there's a bound book ready to read within twenty minutes. Flum.  

A short term delight to rival no other in publishing (except for hearing our name called out at the Nibbies award which was a bloody marvellous feeling) is when a book arrives back from the printer. Hot on the heels of <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/web1905005199.html"">The Death Artist</a>, <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/exmachina.html"">Ex Machina</a> arrived in the office yesterday. I was so worried, as with all our books, that somehow the printer would have dulled the colour, wonked the font, smudged the resolution, or that the gleaming RGB image on our big backlit monitors would, in real life, end up a poor, flat, flimsy disappointment. But it never does. It's PERFECT. Thanks, wondrous Joyce at Cox and Wyman. I had to do a celebratory dance on my own in the office, though, because Gilly and Anna are in America on a Secret Mission (more soon. It's not really secret) and brave soldier James is recovering having lost a fight with his appendix - an apt illness for a publisher, thinking about it. 

Because I didn't have anyone to talk to last week, I got all the boring things done that I normally put off by bugging the others and freed up enough time to indulge myself in having a flick around the web to see whether people are saying anything about us and our books. There are lots of nice things around, especially about our <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/rejection.html"">open rejection letter</a> which I think is honest and illuminating but not blow-your-socks-off amazing, but people do seem to find it more insightful and useful than I gave it credit for. I also found a comment on a blog from someone who said that they had heard about Snowbooks and liked what we were doing but that in their opinion we spend more time talking about Snowbooks than our actual books. Damn, this comment upset me. The commenter probably didn't intend it to be particularly cruel, but I though about all the work we do, all the hours we put in to trying to get the word out about our books, all the copies we send out and the reviewers we talk to and about how friendly we try to be and how much we love our books and how all we ever seem to be doing is blogging, writing, emailing and talking, non-stop, with everyone we meet about our books - and yet this commenter had not seen any indication of all this effort. Back to the drawing board on that one, then. Thank god for the retailers who buy our books and display these little mini billboards (that's what a cover is, after all) in hundreds of locations around the country. Where would we be without them? On that note, Ex Machina has presold 10,000 copies - a Snowbooks record. Whoop! And in the spirit of talking about books not Snowbooks, Ex Machina is the sequel to Adept and an indication of its quality is that my darling husband, who more often than not sits on the sofa picking fault with whatever book he's reading, has sat quietly engrossed in his fresh copy of Ex Machina since 10am today - <em>and hasn't even turned on the football. </em>Job done.","","","","","2006-06-24","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

I've been putting off blogging as I wanted the Death Artist post to stay at the top. We've had some excellent reactions to it, not least from <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/72/ref=amb_b_nav_72/026-8440944-6417222"">Amazon </a>who have put it on their crime page. A trillion* hits a day! The funny thing is it's next to a James Patterson book, and I remember watching a (really quite crappy) TV ad for his last book and thinking 'surely we can do better than that'. And voila. 

I have one quick boring thing to say, too, in case you're thinking about which accountancy package to go with. Quickbooks is utterly useless and Sage is the way of the future. I wish I'd figured that out two years ago. 

Less boringly we met <a href=""http://www.litro.co.uk"">these people</a> this week. We like them and you should too. 

And finally, the thing I actually wanted to post about. <a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/?pid=2&did=20184"">Here's a letter</a> I wrote to the Bookseller this week (full version at the bottom of this post). It was, sadly, edited in one crucial place - the original included an email address where small booksellers can email me to set up their new terms. So: it's <a href=""mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"">emma@snowbooks.com</a> - I can't wait to hear from you! 


(* Estimate rounded to the nearest trillion.)","I attended the recent IPG/BA Small Business Forum meeting in York. Having again heard calls throughout the day, echoing Caroline Abram's letter (30th June), for parity of discount for independent retailers, and in the absence of an independent retailer buying consortium being developed in the near future, from now on Snowbooks will offer the same discounts to independent booksellers as we do to our larger customers. 

There will be no minimum order requirement; all orders will be sale or return, although greater discount is available for firm orders; retailers must have an account with our distributor LBS. Extra discount will be available if you treat our books with extra love (promotions, windows, reviews, table space). 

There is a dusting of altruism in this move, but the real motivation is business-led. By trading directly with retailers, we can better understand their and their customers' needs, and get feedback on what's working and what isn't. By offering larger discounts than our competitors, our books have one more thing in their favour when booksellers consider them alongside the thousands of new titles every month. Retailers may feel more comfortable taking a chance on a Snowbooks title if the risk is lower, and, when they see how well the books sell, will order more and different books.

I hope that this offer is taken up with enthusiasm. In discussion with independents I have detected a marked split: those who want better discounts and those who prefer the convenience of the wholesaler's ""one stop shop"".","","","","2006-07-14","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"
"40719","","1","Our Beloved Founder","Publish","true","I have been utterly taken with the wonders of Mr B's Emporium of Reading Delights, the most beautiful, lingersome and welcoming bookshop I have ever seen, that recently opened in Bath - and I have been impressed not least by their Book Monkey. In his new blog on Guardian Online proprietor Nic explains: 

""In my head [Mr B] is an anonymous cane-wielding philanthropic book collector who searches the world for great books for our customers while the shop is manned by his faithful assistant the Book Monkey (the character on our logo).""

To celebrate the arrival of this fine shop (which I know will flourish from the start because its founders are so right-thinking) I feel moved to introduce a character who I like to think the impressive Mr. B. would have counted as a friend. Few people know that Snowbooks was not, as is widely reported, founded in March 2003 by me and Rob, but is in fact a publishing house established in 1876 by the estimable Artemus Snow, founder of Snowbooks, charitable gentleman, lover of fine books, progressive employer and philanthropist. It was Artemus Snow who engaged that young pup FW Taylor (father of Scientific Management, time and motion studies, and production line theory) in debate at the Royal Society in 1892, a debate that soon threatened to develop into a fistfight. Snow ultimately won the debate, his argument, delivered in his learned, quiet and measured style, that ""production line management destroyed any sense of wonder, enjoyment, pride or ownership in employee's working lives"" beating Taylor's braying, nasal complaints. Snow pointed to the success of his fledgling publishing business, where rather than being restricted to a single role, employees worked in all manner of functions to produce with pride their books. 

Sadly the history books fail to recognise the true outcome of this pivotal debate, and Scientific Management was heralded as the management fad of the day, subjecting millions for decades to a fate working within functional silos, destined to remain unfulfilled and frustrated within their careers.

<img alt=""Our Beloved Founder Artemus Snow"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/artemus.jpg"" width=""167"" height=""238"" />

On the 6th day of every month we at Snowbooks pause to remember our beloved founder. We remember his legacy of kindness, and his driving desire to foster a sense of pride in his workers. We remember his love of books; his unswerving attention to detail; his charm and tact; his love of developing technologies (the telephone, invented the same year Snowbooks was founded and five of which Artemus Snow procured with the proceeds from his first publication, and that new-fangled device the china toilet, invented 1885. It'll never catch on) and his desire to always look to the future.

I reply: 

""Fine, Peterv. We won't bother. Those of us who've taken zero salary for three years, or remortgaged our houses, or who work 16 hours a day for a venture that has no guarantee of working out, or who dare to try something new and brave and different, in order to bring something good into the world - we'll just stay in our pointless little jobs next time, contributing next to nothing to the world and whining away the time until we die. 

Watching the news this week has left me more certain than ever that we should take every opportunity to show that humanity can be good, and clever and creative, rather than blow each other up when provoked. Small, independent companies matter because they are the ones whose objectives aren't directed by shareholders, but by dreams and basic human values like hope, happiness and pride.

I hope they don't take it off us for misuse.","On placentas: 
If Id really wanted to eat a placenta stir-fried with hot chiles, I should have married a different man. I wish we could have planted it under a tree, but the logistics of that for a yardless urban dweller like me are a nightmare. Maybe thats why theyve taken to posting cops nightly at every entrance to Tompkins Square. Its to prevent women from sneaking in to bury their placentas under the cover of darkness. Even if I could get away with it, I wouldnt want it to be exhumed by a hungry rat, a diseased pigeon or a thrill-seeking gutterpunk. We can let it go, I told Esme.

On breastfeeding on the underground: 
We took the subway to the Cloisters, an hour uptown. I was in denial about her need to hit the biological bottle before we reached our destination. Our closest neighbor was a bald man in his fifties, a working-class Jos who remained where he was despite my fervent wish for him to move. Inkys nickering was on the verge of nutting out. With no choice, as discreetly as I could, I unsheathed myself, studying the ads for Dr. Jonathan Zizmors Miraculous Chemical Peel in an attempt to render everything below my neck invisible. Inky clamped on, grunting in relief. I could feel my neighbors eyes upon me. Breastfeeding! he shouted.","","","","2006-07-27","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

See, the Mama Lama layer is raspberry jam, and Adept and Plotting is that stuff you get by mixing margarine and sugar, or something... and The Other Eden is chocolate sponge, and the Death Artist is the icing... and so forth. 

Yep, on this day in 2004 we published our first books. Two years later and what have we achieved? Well we're only Small Publisher of the Year! Still plenty of mileage in that one, oh yes. And we've sold 125,000 books and made, oh, at least as twice as much profit than if we'd just left our start-up capital in a Post Office savings account. Our team has grown from me, Rob and the amazing Gilly, to include the brilliant Anna and the outstanding James. We've published some damn fine books and launched the writing careers of ten debut authors, and have got a really superb list lined up for the next 12 months. 

I am very proud. I also have to get back to the ONIX data entry that I'm trying to get finished. Oh, the glamour of being a small (successful, 2 year old) publisher!","","","","","2006-07-31","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

In the August 2006 issue of <a href=""http://www.thehastingstrawler.co.uk/"">The Hastings Trawler</a> (out next week, GBP3.00 inc. p+p), John Barker discusses the various contributions, particularly enjoying ""HP Tinker's <em>The Morrissey Exhibition</em> which, with a light touch has the singer's miserabilism and fame set out as any other exhibition in which a new exhibit will be ""the small earthquake experienced personally by Morrissey himself on 3rd July 2002"" and which says more about celebrity -- the capitalist version of the Cult of the Personality -- than a whole genre of novels with this theme. It's a real achievement to make something of satire which nowadays is so easily soggy. Better still is the sharpness under the apparent whimsy of Ben Myers' <em>The Missing Kidney</em>.""

In point of fact, I feel sorry for the average reader, the he or she who can't deal with a book that reads like a thrilling magazine (and you have to ask yourself how they deal with life and all the things that life throws at them, if their tiny brains can't deal with the shift between a story and a poem and a piece of non-fiction).

"40726","","1","Rich","Publish","true","Two weeks ago my friend Richard died. He and his wife Roni, who we're all thinking of, founded White Ladder Press about the same time as we founded Snowbooks and Hazel founded Accent Press. We were the three muskateers, challenging the industry with our little pointy swords and flashy feather-topped hats. He died at 56 of a heart attack.  

On Friday it was Rich's funeral. No quiet shuffling off for him: a 20 foot blazing pyre with a pirate flag sticking out the top; shrieking late afternoon fireworks and Leonard Cohen playing in the idyllic stream-bounded field that makes up their front garden in Devon. 

Dealing with death is a deeply personal thing and I have found that time is the enemy for me: as the days have passed I've found the image of Rich slipping in my mind from a life-filled man with huge warmth and generosity of spirit to someone who's gone, who's passed on, and that cold feeling, that fear of forgetting him and letting him die is awful. So it was of huge comfort to hear some out-takes at his funeral from his own recording of the audio book for his Rules of Life book, and then to read this weekend a couple of his books. His warmth, voice and spirit live on! What great legacy writing is, if you can do it - a comfort to those who knew you, a way of leaving your mark and affecting other people after you've gone. Good old books. Good old Rich. I'll miss you, but I'll visit you in your writing.","","","","","2006-08-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"
"40727","","1","Update on submissions","Publish","true","This post is for all those people who so kindly think of Snowbooks when embarking on the road to publication. Er, we are in a bit of a spin, submissions-wise. We have hundreds of manuscripts to read, dating back to 9th May, and are already at maximum work capacity. We really don't want to close the door on submissions, even temporarily, but this is an apology to those who've already submitted, and those who are about to, because it's going to take us a while to read through all the scripts. It's heartbreaking because we're pretty sure that, nestled in the hundreds of emails, are one or two gems, twinkling away. I just hope we get to them before their owners give up on us... so again, a plea to bear with us and an apology for it taking so long. You wouldn't believe how much work a publisher has to do... given that we don't write the books, physically distribute them (thanks to our distributor LBS) or run the shops that sell them, you'd think it would be pretty straightforward. If you're interested, the greatest drains on our time are cover design, editing, rights and permissions, proofreading, typesetting, marketing, sales (so much activity can be condensed into these two words!), data maintenance, image manipulation (that sounds bad, doesn't it), printer management and all the dancing that needs doing when a book comes back from the printer/sells well/gets a good review.","","","","","2006-08-24","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"
"40728","","1","Phewfo","Publish","true","THAT was one hell of a week. Indeed, I think the amount of coffee I've drunk has corroded a hole in my stomach, the way I feel at the moment - but you don't need to know that.

This week was the week of getting all the books to print for Christmas. Our key learning? (as they used to say at Deloitte, shudder.) Things take a lot longer than you'd think. I'll leave it there, and not mention the average time I've finished work. 

We're in a funny position at the moment: successful enough to be financially stable; successful enough to have people say lots of nice things about us, but not quite successful enough to be rolling around in wonga or to have a sufficiently large team to do all the things that need doing - or to be able to pay for external help. And in true control freak style, when I read about people saying nice things about us it worries me, because I know all the things we're doing badly. I know how bad we are at getting reviews (why, newspapers? Why don't you want to review our books? They are good books and you should review them) and how we don't have sufficient hours in the day to chat as much as we'd like with our authors. I know that I haven't updated the business plan for four months, and that I don't know enough about accounting yet, or IT, and that I still haven't finished the rights guide for Frankfurt. 

But I think the main thing is that you have to keep worrying about this stuff. Complacency would be more of a problem - thinking we were doing everything perfectly - because then we'd never keep trying. And we are trying, really hard, and we keep achieving miracles - like getting those Christmas books off to print.

"40729","","1","Top Ten Tips","Publish","true","I had to write this for another website but I thought I'd post it here too. Here, for what it's worth, are my top ten tips for brand new trade publishers. 

1. Ignore most advice. You're starting a publishing company because, presumably, you've got an idea that is different from the norm. It stands to reason that existing players won't be able to advise you very well. Listen, take what's useful, and discard what isn't. This applies to the next nine points. 

2.Put yourself into others' shoes. This is the single most useful thing that you can do and it applies at every stage of the publishing process. For example, when you are making editorial decisions, it really doesn't matter what you think about the books: what will your target readers think? Similarly when you approach retail buyers, try to think about things from their point of view. They are exceptionally busy people with stressful sales targets and a limited budget to buy stock. Do something that will help them achieve their goals and your books stand a much better chance of being listed. 

3. Make planning the most important aspect of your company. Don't focus entirely on the first stage of the publishing process - developing your list - and end up with a garage full of books before you've thought about how to sell them. You need to develop your company's infrastructure from the start, including distribution, IT, and sales. Think through your processes and scheduling before you start. 

4. Stick to the industry timescales. It helps enormously if you allow enough time for other people to do their jobs easily. Magazines work four months in advance; retail chains and wholesalers buy between three and six months in advance. Bear in mind point 1 - there are always exceptions - but sticking to these timescales is much less stressful. 

5. Use IT. One of the reasons that you are able to start a publishing company is because of the cheap, robust IT that exists today. The Adobe suite of software (including Photoshop, InDesign and Acrobat) allows seamless pdf workflow. If you don't know what that means, look it up and learn about this stuff. Use databases to manage your bibliographic data - extremely cheap ones exist from companies like www.anko.ie that allow you to ftp your ONIX compliant bibliographic data direct to Nielsen. Again, if this makes no sense, make it your mission to understand. 

6. Use your background to best effect. Your background will turn out to be your company's compelling USP. Your approach will be determined by what you know and understand best. I used to be a retail buyer, so Snowbooks' core strength is that we understand how retail works. Other companies have strong journalistic backgrounds and use that to great advantage in PR. Use what you know. 

7. Understand that you can sell a book by its cover. The one thing a reader cannot judge a book on at the point of sale is the quality of the writing: they haven't read it yet. Design and packaging is thus crucial. There are more than 100,000 new titles published a year. How do you make yours stand out? Make it blend in first so that it looks like it belongs in the category. It will reassure the retail buyer that you know what you're doing, and once the book is in the stores it has a chance of selling. Readers have to rely on visual cues to place the book in its genre. If the author name is blocky and foiled, and there is a moody looking picture of an alley, chances are the book is a crime thriller - and readers understand this shorthand. Use visual clues to place your book in its genre. 

8. Go shopping. Don't isolate yourself in your office. Visit the places where you hope to sell your wares - the bookstores. Watch and listen to people as they browse. See if you can identify what they're after. Talk to them. Customer research can cost thousands of pounds, but it can also be free if you are clever. 

9. Cut your cloth accordingly. The cash flow cycle in publishing is quite brutal and the entire publishing process can take up to 18 months, so ensure you have enough cash to fund the first couple of years. If you're not adequately capitalised to achieve your business plan, revisit your plan or your funding, but don't assume it will all work out. You might want to consider your exit strategy too, and factor that in to your Day One fundraising. 

10. Enjoy it. There's no point in doing all this unless it fits with your personal values - so if you want to be happy and proud of what you're doing, make sure all your decisions stand a chance of leading to this state. Don't produce books that you think will turn a fast buck if you're going to be embarrassed by them. Conversely, don't publish a book that you know no one will buy just because you love it - it won't sell, you'll lose money and you'll go bust. Take as much pride in building a solid business as you do in building a solid list and you'll stand a greater chance of happiness.","","","","","2006-09-04","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"
"40730","","1","Eek","Publish","true","I saw my first conker of the year today. They're so shiny, aren't they? It's a wonder people don't use them for hypnotising instead of conkering. Of course, conkers means only one thing: Christmas is here. 

We have what I believe is a stonking Christmas range. I was writing some information packs about our Christmas titles today and was getting more and more excited. We've got previously unseen material about Peter Cook; the best crafting book on the market; an 880-page Adept/Ex Machina omnibus; the next book from the brilliant Sarah Bryant; a seminal martial arts book; a hardback of The Sunny Side by A A Milne. Yes - they *are* perfect gifts. Yes - they *are* unique and needful and brilliant. Yes - people might buy them! 

Which got me thinking. Oh god, what if they sell *really* well? Have we printed enough? What happens if we get a real runner? How quickly can the printers respond - or will they be too busy responding to everyone else? What if a customer places a huge order for, ooh, let's say 20,000 copies in November, and we print them and it takes three weeks and we get them into store with two trading weeks left and then they all get returned in January? What if... [breathes heavily into paper bag]. 

It's not all reindeer and port, you know. Christmas is mighty scary - 'specially when you're a little publisher doing quite well who might do a little bit extra well which might, ironically, bankrupt you. Thankfully I have ten years of blue-chip supply chain management, collaborative forecasting, planning and replenishment and strategy training behind me, so what could possibly go wrong? Er...

Still, I remember this time last year thinking that we were going to have a ghastly time of it for the other reason - insufficient sales. The mighty, merciful Scott Pack came to the rescue and bought a couple of books for Waterstone's 3 for 2 which got us through the season unscathed. It shows how far we've come in a year that I'm now worried about too many sales. 

Maybe to steady my nerves I should attempt self-hypnosis. Where's that shiny, shiny conker...?","","","","","2006-09-13","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

"40732","","1","Stimulated","Publish","true","What a great day I've had! Always one who is happier up the strategic end of things, I spent the morning in a focus group thing about IT. The organisers were asking about 'disruptive technologies' which got my hackles up because I'm ignorant and didn't know that a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology"">disruptive technology</a> or innovation is a new technological innovation, product, or service that eventually overturns the existing dominant technology or product in the market. I thought it was going to be another one of those meetings where an angry old man shakes his cane at the speakers and calls for an end to barcodes, or summat. DTs can be positive for the user (think PCs superceding mainframes, or, as wikipedia helpfully says, the musket superceding the crossbow) but negative for the industry (think IBM's P&L the year people stopped buying computers that filled up a couple of rooms, required industrial ventilation and provided enough storage for, ooh, at least a gig of data. To put that into context, we have just taken delivery of a couple of external harddrives that are 500gb each. A terabyte of data... for seventy quid. Poor IBM.) 

Annnyway, this focus group was fascinating and filled with people from publishing who were having sensible, thoughtful and clever conversations about which technologies will affect our industry in the coming months and how we should be positioning ourselves to exploit it. The discussion included, but wasn't limited, to, the effect on the creative industries of ebooks; creative commons, wikis, peer to peer networks, filesharing, authorities, RFID, and all the ways people want to access content. There was discussion about how the current value chain stops at the user experience, wheras a more likely future value chain will be more cyclical, with the user experience turning into feedback (think comments on blogs, capturing word of mouth on corporate websites, sharing opinions on peer to peer networks like myspace) which could guide future editorial direction. Ooh, the possibilities. The other interesting idea was around DRM and trying to stop people stealing content. Someone shared a new point of view: these people were never in the market to buy the content anyway, so it's no lost revenue, so treat it as an opportunity to spread word of mouth instead! 

In summary, it was lovely to immerse myself in interesting, pioneering discussions for a morning.","","","","","2006-09-19","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

There are some benefits to living in London. Being twenty minutes from Sadler's Wells is one of them. Last night Andy (who I don't think I've introduced. Andy, meet the internet. Internet, meet Andy, my perfect husband and the man whose patient willingness to pay for the cat food and the mortgage has led to you reading this blog) and I went to see Sacred Monsters, the latest Sylvie Guillem production. 

I'm no dance critic: all that can be said is that I stared at the stage, round-eyed, for an hour and a half, in awe at what can be done with the body and how it can express what I would have thought could only be achieved with language. The reason I'm mentioning it here on Snowbooks' blog is because of the nature of the production. It's a critical rant; a backlash against classical training. Guillem is angry about the constraints of the traditional ballet school; she breaks convention to speak to the audience about her frustrations of not being allowed to find your own path or alter the rules in the traditional school. The critique gives way to a duet in which Sylvie wraps herself around her partner, and both twine their arms and move their upper bodies so they become like the Hindu god Shiva, the purifier who destroys in order to create. 

So if you know anything about the genesis of Snowbooks you can see why I'd enjoy it.","","","","","2006-09-24","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"
"40738","","1","A message from our Chairman","Publish","true","Here, by way of introduction, is a note from Rob, our chairman. I am his puppet - he has all the good ideas and I pass them off as my own. Over to you, Rob:

""I keep reading criticisms of e-ink e-readers and I think most of the complaints miss the point to such an extent that it almost seems wilful. 

Complaint: It's a heck of a lot (~&pound;200) for a crippled PDA when books are cheaper and better.

Answer: I remember when electronic calculators and portable CD players both cost more than that. This is still about refining the technology - it's not  a mass-market roll-out yet. What about when they cost &pound;10, contain as many books as you want plus encyclopedias, dictionaries, maps, your favourite blogs and maybe the Top 100 bestsellers, each of which you only have to pay for if you read more than three chapters?

Complaint: But books look, feel, smell better. I love books; I despise gadgets.

Answer: The implication is that everyone feels like that. But ordinary people crack the spines of their paperbacks and then drop them in the bath. Some people love books; some people merely tolerate them because that's where the words are. Paperbacks aren't especially lovely things, but an e-reader designed by Apple might well be lovely.

Complaint: You'll never get rid of paper books completely.

Answer: Sure. Of course. Why would you? But even selling 30% of new novels electronically would represent a huge shift in the publishing market - and there's every reason to think it will happen.

Complaint: No one wants to read books on a horrible, flickering screen.

Answer: It's worth getting hold of an e-ink reader to see just how good they are. Zero flicker, crystal clear, readable in the brightest sunshine. Far prettier to look at than cheap ink on Bulky News.

And consider what happens if the gorgeous, paper-like display of the e-reader finds its way into some other device - a mobile phone, a Blackberry e-mail thingie, a PDA. You're carrying round this device anyway; why not load it up with a few books? Click, click, click and it's done. Touch a word if you want it translated/looked up in a dictionary/looked up in an encyclopedia/searched for on the web. Plug in your headphones and have the book play you music while you read. If you don't feel like a novel, push a button and have it be a newspaper instead. You'll still want beautiful editions of your favourite books on paper, but will you really insist on your airport thrillers being a two-inch-thick slab of fibrous paper with a lurid cover rather than a file on your slinky, gorgeous Apple Slate?""","","","","","2006-09-27","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"
"40739","","1","F-F-F-Frankfurt","Publish","true","The weekend before Frankfurt, and I'm worrying about luggage. We have about half a hundredweight of stuff to take over: copies of books that have only just arrived from the printer that couldn't be shipped earlier; catalogues, posters, and the fabulous CDs that James has made that contains our standalone rights guide website (I'll post a photo Monday morning because the design alone is worth it).  
But we're clever about things now. This is our fourth Frankfurt which makes us old timers, and we have worked out the tricks to surviving it after a lot of trial and error. So here is my Top Ten Tips of how to have a successful Frankfurt if you're a small publisher. 
1) Don't go it alone. The IPG stand is the best way to exhibit - not only do you get all the dull stuff done for you (they put up the stand and break it down) but you don't have to be there the whole time, plus you don't have to pay as much or try to get any sense out of the Frankfurt Bookfair organisers who are, let's say, tricksy. 
2) Don't take hotel rates at face value. We stay in the middle of the red light district in the local equivalent of the YMCA for a fraction of what it costs to have a hotel room - but Frankfurt being Frankfurt, the red light district is all clean and well maintained and really quite charming - and ten minutes from the Fair. 
3) If this is your first Frankfurt, ignore what your peers say. They'll say that it's impossible to start a new publishing company, and to save your money. They'll mean well, but they will be patronising and thoroughly unhelpful. Just ignore them. 
4) Don't take a coat. It's roasting. Don't wear heels. I reckon I walk at least three miles a day - fast - down those grey corridors.  
5) Don't expect to see anyone reading a book. Hah! This is business, people. We are trading, not visiting Hay on Wye. Sad but true. 
6) Don't sit talking to your colleagues when someone's trying to catch your attention. You're there to engage with people from around the industry, not catch up on office politics. That means you, lady from Palgrave Macmillan who was so rude to me last year. 
7) Do smile. It's nice to be nice. 
8) Do turn up every day. It's tempting to just come for one day but it's a day of utter hell, trying to get around everyone at once. The best parts of Frankfurt are the serendipitous meetings, the chance happenings. Last year our shelf fell down, so we took turns standing in the aisle holding it up. We got a lot of funny looks - and a lot of conversations were started. At that same fair we were offered 8000 on the spot for a book by a publisher we'd never met - he just found our stand and liked what he saw. Magic! 
9) If you're an author, don't go. That applies to London Book Fair too. Your time is better spent editing your work. The only possible outcome is negative; agents and publishers are there to talk to as many people in the trade as possible in a short space of time and if you get in their way you'll only make them cross. Stick to their submission guidelines and you'll stand a much better chance of them being in a good mood when they read your work. For once that's not just a Snowbooks perspective - it's what everyone thinks. 
10) Do find the parties. One publisher last year had a hotel 40 miles away in the countryside - nice location but she missed out on so many conversations. Conversation is the whole point of attending. 

So we'll keep you updated on how it goes!","","","","","2006-09-30","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

"40741","","1","Back","Publish","true","Back, back to my safe office and own bed and good coffee and unhobbled web connection and email and more coffee and everything. Sure, seeing the world is nice an'all, but Frankfurt hardly counts as a holiday and I'm very glad to be back... to the teetering piles of invoices which seem to be flooding my desk. Hmm. Remember I told you about that whole 'ooh Christmas is scary because lots of bookstores have bought lots of books but let's hope readers buy them too' thing? Well phase one of the scariness has started because I now have the print bills to pay. Gulp. 

But the signs are good. Frinstance, we are having tremendous success with pre-orders of The Crafter's Companion. Last week Anna put a pre-order Paypal button on her website which I haven't even bothered to put on Snowbooks' yet... since then we have sold more than $5000 worth! And you should <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/thecrafterscompanion/preorders.html"">pre-order it too</a>. 

And that's not all. Frankfurt was a stormer - our best ever, probably. We only did one actual shake-hands-sign-contract-take-photo deal (on foreign rights for Ex Machina) but we:
 - met with foreign wholesalers and our export partners from Europe, Australia, Asia and the US (hello!) and agreed to send them a lot of books to sell
 - had excellent foreign rights interest in all our books but highlights included Deep Hanging Out (which will have its own blog post soon. Sorry this is in the wrong order), Crafters, Lint (huge interest. Steve Aylett is <em>everyone's</em> favourite author, turns out), Ex Machina, Plotting, Taking the Plunge, How Very Interesting, Sand Daughter (huge again), Sob Story (massive interest) and Needle in the Blood. 
 - caught up with our peers. <a href=""http://www.summersdale.com/"">Summersdale</a> have always looked after us and tell us wise things. Such nice boys. Mark from <a href=""http://www.quercusbooks.co.uk/trade.html"">Quercus</a> is similarly charming and really lovely to talk to.  And <a href=""http://www.thefridayproject.co.uk"">The Friday Project </a>were looking gorgeous - right-thinking publishers unite. 

Lots to do this week - huge amount of follow ups to do and let's not forget those bloody bills to pay. So I'll leave you with this to ponder. Here is a photo of the Frankfurter Hof - the most popular hotel for publishers to stay.

If you are an editorial assistant in a large publishing house on &pound;18,000 and your manager tells you the company can't possibly afford to give you a &pound;500 pay rise, show them this photo and ask how many of your senior management stayed there. In BookFair week, room rates are &euro;500 a night with a minimum four night booking - &euro;2000 per person. Compare that to our wonderful accomodation: total bill for <em>four </em>people for five nights was &euro;700. We were in BUNK BEDS, for god's sake - but we have a lot more money to be spent on things other than jacuzzis as a result.  ""Snowbooks: spending money wisely since 2003.""

Fair dos: I agreed to it (read: fell for it) when the salesperson called, and even went through with it after sleeping on it. We designed a nice advert. The piece of advertising appeared. Nothing happened: no one called, no one noticed, no one cared. Then the (eyewateringly large) bill arrived. That is the natural order of things in the world of advertising - unless you spend above a certain amount. 

There are those who would tell you that advertising is about building brand presence; that it's very difficult to measure the success of an individual piece and that 50% of advertising works, you just don't know which half. Me, I say it's a load of cobblers. Advertising is a waste of money and I'm kicking myself for falling for it. 

However, I'm off to Wales for the weekend to see my lovely mum and dad (hello!) where everything gets put into perspective and the air clears all the cobwebs away.

"40749","","1","Levels of incompetence","Publish","true","When I worked in retail (I know, boring, but bear with me) the world was awash with anecdotes (the basic building block of strategic planning in the retailers I worked for) about what could be done with loyalty card data. Frinstance, the old ""beer and nappies"" story* was hauled out time and again to demonstrate that people shop in interesting ways and therefore the layout of all stores should be changed - for the sixth time that year. 

Bitter invective about my former employers aside, loyalty card data and basket analysis, done properly, are fundamentally useful, statistically significant sources of information about the actual behaviour of your customers - much more robust data than focus groups, for example. 

But in the book world, we're just at the start of this adventure. Waterstone's have been trialling a loyalty card, and the signs are promising - great uptake, interesting data coming through and what appears to be real insight into their customers' behaviour. Amazon, of course, have similarly interesting data and EPOS means all retailers can effectively monitor their customers' habits, preferences and behaviour. 

So maybe now is the time to use this tremendous body of data to revise the ghastly product classification hierarchy that our industry is lumbered with. You can take a look at it <a href=""http://www.nielsenbookdata.com/bicTree/bicGen.html"">here.  </a> Reading it is like reading the minutes of the meeting where every man and his dog must have got together to argue about what should appear.

I think this should be an industry, not a consultant-led exercise - maybe a cross-retailer team could be set up to revise the classifications. Who better? They know how people shop, and with shopper behaviour getting more and more visible it could make a huge difference to the industry. 

*You don't know the 'beer and nappies story'? Oh, man. Pull up a chair. Some bright spark in the loyalty card data department noticed that a lot of baskets contained just two items - beer and nappies. The analyst poked around a bit, asked some questions and discovered that it appeared women were sending their husbands to the supermarket for nappies. Whilst they were there, the men were making a quick detour to the beer aisle to pick up a little something to anaesthetise their poor baby-addled brains. The marketing department decided to act on this insight and ran a trial where they merchandised nappies and beer on the same aisle and lo! Sales tripled. Or quadrupled, or went up by an order of magnitude, or went up by a million percent, depending on when you heard this anecdote and whether it had been sufficiently exaggerated by then.","","","","","2006-10-17","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"
"40750","","1","Our friend, destruction","Publish","true","So yesterday saw me attend a seminar about digitisation. I sit near the door at these things, just in case. Should've bolted. We've spent quite a lot of time thinking through our strategy so I wasn't coming to this with a blank canvas, and what do you know? I came away with exactly no additional information to add into our planning. Actually, that's not quite true: I came away with a sense of exactly which companies will be around in years to come, and which ones will fail without knowing what hit them. 

How much longer can this industry continue to be on the defensive? Or to be so obtuse? Amazon WILL disintermediate the supply chain and offer publication services to authors; authors WILL take advantage of this because it is currently almost impossible to get published. A decent e-reader WILL come along and the mass market WILL engage in time. And why aren't publishers more worried about their role in life? As we've said before, publishers do so little. They outsource almost every function, from typesetting and printing to distribution, sales and sourcing content (to agents and authors) and even editorial and proofreading work. Ah yes, dear, they say, but publishers are a badge of quality. Their careful eye selects the needles from the haystack. Well if our main role is as a filter, we are doing a pretty shocking job. The back of every book screams 'this is the best book' - blurbs and endorsements provide no real differentiation. Books that editors pay vast sums for fail to earn back their advances, so how good are those editors as the arbiters of the reading public's taste? Peer to peer networks WILL provide the best recommendations and will act as a perfectly good filter of quality even as the number of books available increases. 

The businesses that survive over the long term will be those that are willing to destroy themselves, phoenix-stylee. Those who cling on for their pound of flesh or their 10% or who work hard to protect their job description are delusional if they think the market will tolerate them. That makes me excited for Snowbooks, because we're good at knocking stuff down, and a lot of businesses aren't. It stands to reason: the skills that get a 55 year old man to be the md of his organisation are pretty much defunct in the organisation of the future - why would he bring about his own redundancy? 

We have a healthy respect for the market.  We know that readers already don't need us; we know that in the future authors won't need us unless we do something useful to improve their content. So we keep most of our processes in-house; we add value to books through editorial work and design. And more than anything, we don't think of digitisation as a thing that needs to be tackled. It's the world, and a big shiny exciting one at that. 

So: rant over. No more looking at what everyone else is doing wrong - there's no talking to them, so stuff 'em. Subsequent posts will be about exciting, forward-looking developments. To the future!","","","","","2006-10-19","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

"40752","","1","extra, extra","Publish","true","I LOVE not working for anyone. I've just finished reading an exceptional submission (in one sitting. The greatest luxury in the world) which has as one of its many themes the problems of employers and the corporatisation of the world. In a corporation this post would be impossible, which is extraordinary because it is a very simple one. It's merely to mention that we have a few mini-sites which you might not be aware of and which you might enjoy. They are:

<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/fighting"">www.snowbooks.com/Fighting</a> - a page that includes links to some extracts from the book. 
<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/papercut"">www.snowbooks.com/papercut</a> - the homepage to our gory movie trailer for The Death Artist
<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/thecrafterscompanion"">www.snowbooks.com/thecrafterscompanion</a> - details about our gorgeous crafty book. 

Now, if snowbooks was a corporate hierarchy, not only would the proposal for the development of these sites have had to go through a capex review, and been executed by a costly project management team (as opposed to being knocked up in a few hours by the self-same, uber-multi-talented people (including me, that means. So modest) who bought the titles, and edited them, and designed them, and market them), but I would have had to have been invited to post about them using marketingspeak. But seeing as we don't have to be on-message, or worry about what this post will do to our position within the corporate hierarchy (will Sales be cross at me for stepping on their toes? Did we get signoff from Ops?) I am free to post this from the comfort of my sofa without asking anyone's permission. I am also free to be honest, which you wouldn't think could be as much of a luxury as it is: so for god's sake don't download the papercut movie if you are squeamish; don't visit the Fighting website if you have no interest in martial arts and don't look at the crafting website if you don't like handicrafts. 

See, that's common sense - don't read about something if you have no interest in it. But marketingspeak doesn't do common sense - plus as a lowly middle manager you get into trouble if you're seen as badmouthing the brand. Moreover, it's so much effort for marketing departments to think about people as individuals; so much easier to think of them as a mass body and it leads to bland, hyperbolic marketing messages: 'This book is perfect for everyone!'  Which, we know, is rarely the case. 

There's a lot to say on this subject, and even more to do. I might ask Rob (source of all wiseness) to write something on it... but in the meantime I have another submission to start on. Hooray for the rain, and warm cats, and cups of hot black tea, and the soft glow of the laptop...","","","","","2006-10-22","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

So this is what happens when you decide you're not going to turn on your computer all weekend. You only get selected as <a href=""http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/10/site_of_the_week_me_and_my_big.html"">Site of the Week</a> by the Guardian! Quick, write something sensible so people will think we're clever. Er... (grinding noise, splutter)...no. Not only did I decide to have a Weekend Off The Computer (except second life which I can't live without, and buying a new pair of boots on M&S, and looking something up on wikipedia, but nothing work related which has got to count for summat, right?) I have also given up coffee which means I'm a little slower getting going in the morning (even though it's really 9.30, not 8.30, because of the clocks.) So no witticisms or sparks of brilliance for you, young reader-m'lad. 

Anyway. Since they say we're a 'literary blog' I should mention something to do with books. Our Christmas range went into stores last week, and what do you know? We have absolutely NO idea how it's selling. This is thus a very good time to talk about something I've been meaning to post about for ages, which is access to epos. Sounds like a part-time course - but no. 

Nielsen BookScan (-m?) are the company that holds the monopoly of retail sales monitoring in this industry (a monopoly only because no other company bothers). They collect information from around 8000 retailers (which is not comprehensive, but whatever - sampling is a given), validate it and aggregate the data into reports which they sell back to publishers, so they can see how their sales are doing, and retailers, so they can calculate their market share. 

So far, so good. However, we have never been able to avail ourselves of this service. Why? Because ""any 5 nominated ISBN's [sic] (titles) [sic] tracked over 4 consecutive weeks costs &pound;525."" Subsequent months are &pound;75.  It's &pound;270 per title per year on this ratecard! &pound;10000 a year for 35 titles! So we can either have a profitable title and not know about it or spend our profit on finding that out. Now I'm sure they'd do a deal if you subscribed, or bought more data than just a month's worth, but we're still talking thousands. 

Why so expensive? Are their epos collecting processes so awfully inefficient that it genuinely costs this much? Are they using people to sort the data rather than computers? Or are they charging this much because firms really do need this data, and they're the sole gatekeepers.

Economics 101, innit? Better get us some competition. Anyone? Anyone?","","","","","2006-10-30","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

I'm feeling a bit jealous of Em. She's the main contributor to the SnowBlog and so the Guardian thing (see previous) must be mainly down to her. It seems my chance for fame has passed me by, while Em gets to roll around in all the glory like I imagine very rich people do in their baths full of money. It's time I tried to catch up.

But what to post about? Well, one conversation I have a lot lately revolves around the question: 'Why is Publishers?'. Or, slightly more grammatically: what are publishers for? Why might you want one? And are these publishers of which you speak earning their keep?","One's first thought is that publishers are useful because they bring us books - but then a moment later, you realise that a lot of what publishers do is outsourced (which I like to think of as the business equivalent of sending out for pizza instead of cooking dinner). Publishers don't print books; frequently they don't typeset them, or design the covers, or warehouse the stock, or ship it to stores. They may in some sense provide the world with books, but publishers don't drive lorries or mix ink. And, of course, for the most part, they don't generate the words and pictures between the covers. 

What they do are two things. They select which titles to print - and then they tell everyone else how great those titles are. Or to put it more succinctly, they do acquisition and marketing.

Defenders of publishing's place in the world like to talk about publishers being a quality filter: they sift for gold amongst the dross. But when you have hundreds of publishers all clamouring that every one of their thousands of titles is a nugget of pure gold, it's not clear how effectively that filter is working. The best you could say is that things might be much worse if publishers didn't at least try to protect us from sub-standard work. Or perhaps not.

And as for the clamouring part of their job, marketing to retailers gets the titles into stores and marketing to customers gets books into shopping baskets - but that's all for the publisher's benefit; what do non-publishers get out of it? From some angles it looks like very little. So, ""Publishers (grunt) what are they good for? Vanishingly close to nothing"" (as the song goes).

Of course publishers do one more thing: they absorb risk. That's to say, they take a chance on their titles. They put their money, effort and reputation behind a book and hope that their gamble pays off. In that sense they <em>do</em> make books, thus ensuring that a few horribly formatted files on a computer (or god forbid, a sheaf of typewritten pages) become an actual, professional-looking, shop-bought book. 

I've had other suggestions of functions that publishers perform. For instance, they administer the process of creating books, coordinating all the various roles - which doesn't strike me as much of a hook to hang your survival on. And one well-meaning publisher told me that their most important role is to develop authors. I think that's a lovely idea and the sooner it actually happens the better, I say.

So I think we're left with publishers being the backers and risk-takers behind books. And what I see is that every year technology makes it easier to turn a Word file into a pallet full of paperbacks - or just a single copy, if you prefer. And every year devices for reading books electronically get more desirable, more practical and more affordable. I'm wondering if there'll come a day when the only reason that publishers can put forward to justify their cut of the book industry's profits is that they tell readers what to read. Then all it would take is for readers to band together into online communities and share their collected opinions of new writing and we wouldn't need publishing companies' biased views on what was good; we could be guided by our fellow readers. And on that day publishers will go the way of the dodo and the <a href=""http://ion.le.ac.uk/cutlass/clanger.html"">clanger</a>, and Em and I will have suddenly have a lot more time on our hands to work on our blog entries.","","","","2006-10-30","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

That's not the full number, as it happens - we have sold rights to more countries including Germany, Spain and a number of Eastern European publishers. What fun! And how nice to see that we are selling the same thing more than once - a strategy I like. 

Notice the absence of a hardback: we've decided that the current publishing model of hardback-first-paperback-second is publisher, not reader, focused. In the case of debut authors, why should a reader have to shell out &pound;17 on an unknown quantity - or if the author is established, how unfriendly to offer the high priced hardback for a year and make the reader wait for the paperback? We go into hardback when the shopping mission is a gift, or a collectible edition, but we don't just issue hardbacks to extract the maximum amount of money out of people. That would be mean. Like many things in publishing, though, hardback publishers don't mean to be mean; they're just doing what they've always done, so why change? Why indeed.","","","","","2006-11-03","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

Interesting, slightly breathless account of how the U.S. publishing market is supposedly waking up to the potential of book sales through non-book-outlets <a href=""http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,1939457,00.html"">here</a>. The breakthrough appears to have been re-designing the book to complement its new environment. I'm not saying it wouldn't have some effect, but I found the whole thing a rather strange way to come at the problem. For me, personally, the story was something of a milestone because the instinctive, dismissive grunt I made when I read it came very close to a 'harrumph'. Does that mean I'm middle-aged now? Or do I only need to worry if I find myself adding 'stuff and nonsense' in a pugnacious little growl?","The reason for the harrumphing was that Snowbooks has been looking at the U.S. book market  and wondering why so many cover designs are - and I don't want to offend anyone here - but from a purely design or aesthetics point of view, what you might call 'ugly'. ""That's the U.S. market,"" we've been told. It's even been suggested to us that if we tried to release U.S. editions of our books that were too pretty they might put American customers off. Fortunately, a big part of the idea behind Snowbooks involved Em and I practicing the phrase 'Thanks so much for the advice, but if you don't mind I think we'll try it our way'. Even so, it's a surprise to read how successful HarperCollins and Penguin have been through tweaking their designs specifically for the cheese counter or the paint section. Setting aside the question of whether this is a news story, or merely two press releases bolted together, I think it's a good omen for us. If more time spent on cover design is paying off in the poultry aisle then there's every reason to think it will work in an even more important retail environment for books: the U.S. book store. Who knows, maybe Penguin and HarperCollins will use the lessons learned to boost their sales in the non-food, non-clothing and non-hardware sectors.","","","","2006-11-04","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

It's Anna here, writing from America.

In case you've been wondering how a small business like Snowbooks can function when one of its employees is 4000 miles and six hours away, I've taken a photo of my desk.

It's not so different, really.  Slightly darker, on account of those six hours, but I've still got PG Tips to see me through the day (brought over in my suitcase, because what if the stuff in the US shops isn't genuine?).  Mind you, the accompanying biscuit is really more of a 'cookie,' and I don't think the frosting's particular shade of orange exists outside the States (in food products, anyway).  But these are the things one must get used to.

"40761","","1","Workmanship","Publish","true","So I was rooting around in old emails sent to me by Rob, because this morning, by way of some advice I was given, I was reminded of an excellent Powerpoint slide Rob an' his mate Dan knocked up a few years back. At first glance it looked like standard consulting fare: good, beefy arrows pointing in the right direction, a couple of graphs, bold, to the point font. But it was a comedy slide intended to mock the useless, motherhood advice that most consultants trumpet. You know: To achieve our corporate vision, we must grow sales, improve return on capital, focus on improving performance and generate increased shareholder value. Yeees, those are good things, but it's not exactly an implementable plan, is it? On this slide that I was looking for, there was a big arrow pointing up labelled 'improve sales', and one pointing down labelled 'reduce costs'. And a graph trending upwards. And a pie chart. And the sad thing was that it wasn't too far removed from most of the slides I churned out as a consult-a-slave. 

Anyway, I couldn't find the slide, which was annoying. I did, however, come across an old article written by Rob which is interesting. So here it is for your delectation: 

<h2><font color=""maroon"">The history of bad workmanship</font></h2>

<strong>Dinner party horror stories</strong>

It's a subject that can bring even the most reluctant dinner guest out of their shell. Once a group of people start talking about rotten service they've received, or unsatisfactory work they've had done on their house, there's no stopping them. For some reason, bank staff draw the heaviest fire in my circle of friends; perhaps it's decorators with you or maybe plumbers.

Is this something new or was it ever thus? A well-read friend of mine tells me Samuel Pepys, writing in the seventeenth century, complains of builders who never seem to make any progress. Whenever Pepys arrives, they are always on a break.

It may be that complaints about the trades are as old as the trades themselves, but what if matters are getting worse? This article will explore how a new kind of psychology is revealing more and more about the sins flesh is heir to.","<strong>Junk in the attic</strong>

This new psychology takes the lessons biologists have learned about evolution, specifically the way it shapes animal behaviour, and applies them to human beings.

At first, that sounds like a bad idea. After all, humans clearly aren't ruled by their instincts the way a chicken or a snake might be. One of the things that separates us from animals is our ability to make our own choices. 

Animals, you might say, seem to operate on a sort of perpetual autopilot from the moment they're born to when they die. Humans, on the other hand are self-aware and in control of their actions - completely different. But are we really creatures of pure intellect? What about (to take one example) emotions? 

Nobody sits down and decides to have emotions; they're there whether you want them or not, colouring your thinking. They're part of what it means to be human. Certainly we don't have a simple instinctive autopilot guiding us, but what if we have a sophisticated one, as befits creatures with such complex brains? There's no doubt each of us is born with a sense of free will, but we're also born with an 'Idiot's guide to human behaviour' wired into our brains which we fall back on - in between our bouts of self-determination.

<strong>Our inheritance</strong>

If we want to understand what our built-in 'Idiot's guide' might be prompting us to do, we need to understand where it came from. It is a compendium of instincts and natural abilities we inherited from our ancestors. We need to understand what their lives were like to appreciate the instincts we've inherited from them.

And that's a shocking idea. It's bad enough to accept that despite all our sophistication, we are still sometimes prompted by instinct. But those instincts aren't even appropriate to our daily lives, in a lot of cases. They come from a time before houses and agriculture, when the human race was composed of nomadic groups wandering the plains of Africa, before we spread out and conquered the globe. 

That period holds the key because it's the last time the human race made an evolutionary jump. We know that's true because modern humans, no matter where on the globe their ancestors lived, are all pretty similar. We vary quite a bit cosmetically, but internally and genetically, we're virtually identical. It would be tough to explain how any genetic changes that took place after the great expansion could have been propagated evenly to all the tribes of the Earth. 

If that was the last time we did any major evolving, then it was the lifestyle of the African plains that put the finishing touches to the architecture of our brains. Whatever instincts are preserved in our genes, they were shaped and tested by our time on the African savannah. 

Most interestingly, we all lived as part of a group in those days - maybe averaging forty or fifty individuals - and we evolved to suit life in a group. There was no second pocket of humans living as loners; we're all the descendants of people who lived in close-knit communities and we've inherited their programming.

And if those early nomads had the same genetic make-up as us, then they had the same brains - which means they must have been talking to each other. If we want to understand what life was like for them, a good place to start is to figure out what they needed language for. What made language (in the jargon of the dot.com era) a 'killer app'?

<strong>Language and hunting</strong>

The first thought most people come up with is that language was important because it helped us hunt together. They imagine the further back in time one goes, the more predatory our species would have been. In the popular imagination, early man is a dedicated hunter - he always carries a spear, he's always on the lookout for something to roast.

A quick glance at the human body reveals a distinct lack of armour or offensive weaponry. Certainly, if we were a species of full-time hunters, any advantage language might have conferred would have been very welcome. Think of any large African animal of today and it's difficult to imagine a lone human tackling one successfully. It seems likely that in those days our best weapon would have been teamwork. 
Certainly the savannah would have been a dangerous place for a soft, juicy mammal with no claws, horns or hoofs - most of us have jaws so narrow we can barely take a bite out of a big sandwich. Teamwork would have been our only and best hope for survival.

That's why this era would have had such an impact on how humans behave in groups. It's a little like imagining the whole human race used to live in submarines - one per community. Survival was intimately connected to the survival of one's crewmates. You couldn't wander off to live on your own on the Savannah any more than you can stride out the airlock of a submarine.

So teamwork and survival seem to go hand in hand, but survival is not the same thing as hunting. There isn't much evidence to suggest we were mighty hunters, so we can't use that accomplishment to explain language. Even amongst the few twenty-first century tribes still living the Stone Age life, hunting prowess is more a matter of exaggeration than fact. An infrequent big kill seems to eclipse the steady diet of vegetables, fruit and small game when it comes time to describe a typical meal. I might just as well claim that my Christmas dinner is my typical midday snack. Teamwork would have been central to our continued existence, but a picture of our ancestors patrolling the plains like teams of Special Forces commandos is misleading.

It's possible that language had more to do with getting along than it did with hunting. In terms of horrendously mixed metaphors, language might have been what oiled the machinery of social interaction and the glue that held it together. But what specifically did we use it for? The most intriguing suggestion is that we used it for gossiping.

<strong>Gossip</strong>

To understand why a species would want to gossip, we have to think about what life for a typical group of forty or fifty humans was like in those days. Imagine you're part of a group like that. You don't work for yourself. The food you gather, the work you do is for the group and in turn the group provides you with what you need. The most important consideration for you is to make sure that you're getting your fair share of the rewards.

That means you'll have lots of conflicting demands on your time. You'll want to check up on behaviour all over the group to make sure you're not being cheated. But if you're hunting, you're not monitoring the food stores. If you're keeping an eye on the food stores, you're not seeing how much fruit is really being picked. And if you put yourself on fruit detail, you're not spying on your mate or guarding your offspring. Sooner or later you have to trust someone. Sooner, in fact, because you probably risk your life every time you go hunting or fall asleep. Every individual in a group will want to make sure they're getting their fair share of the group's success and at the same time they'll also want to make sure no one else is getting a free ride. It's difficult to do that if you can only be in one place at once and you haven't yet evolved language. 

<strong>Fairness</strong>

Let's think for a moment about what that constant monitoring has done to us. Anyone who has shared student accommodation knows what it's like - the compulsive labelling of things in the fridge, the arguments over whose milk, whose biscuits - the constant bickering. What a lot of us fail to understand is that the endless rehashing of who has a right to what isn't necessarily a sign of discord; it's a mechanism for avoiding it. In pygmy tribes in New Guinea and Aboriginal parties in Australia the same conversations take place. We're always testing the boundaries of our entitlement and jealously guarding our personal property.

Life in a group is a perfect opportunity to give your all and get nothing in return - to get screwed, in other words. Our species' obsession with fairness is one of the ways of keeping everything in balance - and it's a lot easier to do if you can talk to each other. 
So imagine again that you're a member of a group of ancestral humans. You're constantly trying to spot the cheats, to calculate your share, to work out who it's safe to trust. With language, you can pool your information. It's like trust radar. It can give you an early warning for trouble and it can help you see the big picture. You can also use it to build alliances against shared adversaries or in favour of common goals. It's the mechanism we need to make trusting others viable.
We may have finally arrived in what some call the Information Age, but ironically that's how we started out. Before money was invented, before we had much in the way of possessions, we were trading information about each other.

<strong>Reputations</strong>

With language, we have a nice little feedback loop. Monitoring others and swapping information about who's trustworthy is the input side. Deciding where to place our trust or allegiance and complaining like hell when it's abused is the output side. Each of us go round and round that loop - adjusting our network of trust and then monitoring its success. We do it so well and so instinctively we don't even realise it's happening a lot of the time. But it's our compulsion to behave this way that explains part of our fascination with soap operas. They're like case studies for the part of our brains in charge of community relations. We are fascinated to see if Jolene realises that Brad is cheating on her with Clarice and how that will affect her decision to sell the coffee shop. It gives the 'social accounting' module in our brain something to get its teeth into, now that most of us don't know our neighbours.

<strong>Bad service</strong>

How does all this link back to bad service? Well clearly ideas about evolutionary psychology can be taken in a lot of directions. One fruitful line of investigation is to apply these ideas to business, to see what light they shed on job satisfaction or customer complaints. The single example we're considering here is about not getting the service you paid for. What does evolutionary psychology tell us about that?
Well one thing we know is that reputation plays a large part in governing group behaviour. If each of us place our trust only in those we have a good opinion of, it stands to reason that our own reputations are something we'll instinctively want to protect. Yet most people who do work for you or come to your home are strangers. You probably got the name of their company from the Yellow Pages. The link between their actions and their reputation has been severed. The next person to pick to pick a name from the Yellow Pages won't know about the bad experience you had.

<strong>The old-fashioned way</strong>

But imagine falling back on the original mechanism for regulating behaviour. Imagine there was no Yellow Pages or local paper or advertising. How would you find a plumber or a decorator? You'd keep your ears open or you'd ask around. The next time dinner party guests gave in to their instinct to pass on tales of rewarded or abused trust you'd be taking note. Imagine a world where the only way a business could get more work was if their customers spread the word. How long would it be before bad workmen went the way of the dodo? It's worth a thought next time you reach for the phone book.","","","","2006-11-09","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Reviews by PAUL WHITELAW

<strong>Peter Cook: So Farewell Then</strong>
by Wendy Cook
HarperCollins, 400pp, &pound;18.99

<strong>How Very Interesting: Peter Cook's Universe and All That Surrounds It</strong>
Edited by Paul Hamilton, Peter Gordon and Dan Kieran
Snowbooks, 300pp, &pound;9.99

THE METEORIC RISE AND fall of Peter Cook is one of the most spurious myths in showbiz. Accepted wisdom states that Cook peaked by the time he was 30, and went to pieces after his partnership with Dudley Moore dissolved in the late 1970s.

The biopic, Not Only But Always, starring Rhys Ifans, unwaveringly ascribed to this view, while Harry Thompson's otherwise definitive biography did little to dispel the notion that Cook ended his days as an embittered alcoholic who never achieved his true potential. Wendy Cook, the comedian's first wife, certainly seems to side with this view, but as the last chapter of her rather aimless autobiography attests, she saw him only sporadically after they divorced in the 1970s.

Until then, they had lived a superficially charmed lifestyle. Glittering baubles on the swinging London vine, the Cooks were famed for their celebrity-studded soir&eacute;es, where the likes of Kenneth Tynan, Bernard Levin and Jonathan Miller would rub shoulders with Lenny Bruce and a Beatle or three.

The young, handsome Cook was a star of television, the West End and Broadway, rightfully f&ecirc;ted as the funniest man of his generation. And yet his frightfully reserved upper-middle-class background, complete with boarding school and Cambridge education, rendered him something of a cold fish.

Although Wendy admits he was not incapable of affection, he was someone to whom outward displays of emotion were anathema. Perhaps because of this, she writes about him rather listlessly. Theirs was not a passionate relationship, therefore their story proves rather unengaging. She also makes the cardinal error of assuming that anyone is interested in any parts of her life that didn't involve her husband, leading to eminently skippable passages detailing in drab detail the minutiae of life as a hostess to the London gliteratti.

Furthermore, her supposedly ""untold"" tale is little more than the already well-documented Cook saga, with very little insight of her own. Typically for even those closest to him, his former wife is no nearer to uncovering the ""real"" Cook than anyone else.

She is, however, remarkably frank about their open relationship, which she ascribes to misjudged 1960s liberalism, and which was certainly a major factor in their break-up.

Both enjoyed a series of affairs, but it was Wendy's relationship with actor Simon Gray that tore her marriage apart. In the book's only genuinely shocking revelation, she tells of being punched and kicked down the stairs by a drunken Cook after he learned of the affair; an inexcusable incident which renders a later Derek and Clive skit on marital abuse all the more disturbing.

Wendy admits that her Peter differs wildly from most other accounts, which generally describe Cook as a kind, warm and generous man. Indeed, this is the most oft-repeated assessment in How Very Interesting, a marvellous collection of interviews and essays compiled by the Peter Cook Appreciation Society.

The result of a heroic decade-long attempt to catalogue the musings of virtually everyone Cook worked with and influenced throughout his career, it offers a surprisingly consistent portrait of a generally gleeful man whose comedic gifts remained intact until the end, as evinced by his appearance on Clive Anderson Talks Back and the magnificent Radio 3 series with Chris Morris, Why Bother? Indeed, one of the most fascinating interviews is with the enigmatic Morris, Cook's true spiritual heir.

Although the PCAS was sadly unable to track down Dudley Moore before he died, nearly everyone else is here, from John Fortune, Auberon Waugh and Mel Smith, to Dick Clement, Will Self, Ian Hislop and even the engineer who recorded the notorious Derek and Clive sessions.

The overall picture painted by these accounts is of an awe-inspiring genius who, despite his emotional failings, sailed through life in a state of near-permanent amusement at the absurdities of the universe. And for someone who reputedly failed to achieve his potential, Cook's influence on comedy remains utterly without peer.</blockquote>","","","","","2006-11-13","2013-03-29","","","","","0"

Scott over at the Friday Project is always <a href=""http://www.thefridayproject.co.uk/pack/"">going on</a> about music, so now it's my turn. D'you remember this?

Mr. Dawes Sr, Mr. Banks and Bankers:
If you invest your tuppence
Wisely in the bank
Safe and sound
Soon that tuppence, 
Safely invested in the bank,
Will compound

And you'll achieve that sense of conquest
As your affluence expands
In the hands of the directors
Who invest as propriety demands

You see, Michael, you'll be part of
Railways through Africa
Dams across the Nile
Fleets of ocean greyhounds
Majestic, self-amortizing canals
Plantations of ripening tea

All from tuppence, prudently
Fruitfully, frugally invested
In the, to be specific,
In the Dawes, Tomes
Mousely, Grubbs
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank!

Fleets of ocean greyhounds indeed. I'm please to say that no-one's given us any tuppences to be invested in Snowbooks - it means that all this hard work is for us, and us alone, and that's another story. The current reason for the bowler hat and the bank song is because that's what I feel a publisher is, sometimes: a bank. Here is a graph that shows the typical cash flow for a typical publisher: 

<img alt=""graph.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/graph.jpg"" width=""400""  />

So you start at zero profit. A is an advance. B is the cost of payroll whilst the team is creating the lovely book. C is the cost of print (which has varying repayment terms but you can guarantee you're going to need to pay the printer before you've received any money from sales). C-D is the time during which you lend retailers money in the form of stock assets for 90+days. At D it gets interesting - how successful is the book? Path E is a steady earner, maybe niche non-fiction, slowly but steadily earning its way back to profit - even though on this graph it looks like it will take about twelve years. F is depressing - a brief spurt then plateauing waaaay below breakeven. G is what we hope for every time - a runner that storms past breakeven and pays for E and F. 

Point is, that's a hell of a long time to be paying money out before getting it back again - 18 months in this made-up example - and these are only a few of the costs; don't forget rent, marketing, postage, blah. You're either paying out or lending money without any sort of guarantee that you'll get it back. Compare that to the cash flow model for, for example, my parent's old business, a primary school. Cash comes in on the first day of term; it gets spent over the course of the next few months then the cycle starts again. The graph is always positive. 

So that's why I feel like a bank. Although, of course, banks can foreclose, call in their loans, securitise their lending on assets... We're a mix between a bank and a charity. Good thing I love my job, isn't it.","","","","","2006-11-14","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Thinks. Maybe we should be down at the library, searching through big books, looking for a business idea with exactly complementary cashflow to that of publishing, so we can graft it onto Snowbooks and balance everything out. And maybe we should adopt it, whatever it is, providing its graph is the mirror image of the publishing one. I like to think that we'd wind up with something really cool that way. Unfortunately, the only complementary business I can come up with so far is
lottery-winner-who-subsequently-sells-story-to-magazine-then-flogs-film-rights. But maybe there's something else out there.

This complementarity stuff reminds me of the story I was told a long time ago about how Walls produced both sausages and ice cream, because nobody wanted ice cream in the winter and no one trusted their sausages in the heat of summer. It's a nice story, but doesn't it suggest that Mr Whippee should be offering piping hot winter bangers around now?","","","","","2006-11-15","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

I know we tend to be a bit <a href=""http://www.thefridayproject.co.uk/pack/"">Scott Pack</a> this, Scott Pack that, and did you hear what Scott said about this other thing here? But a big bit of that is because he tends to be braver than us in speaking his mind, so his views provide a very handy point of reference. We can sort of hide behind him while he's telling off the establishment, and then we can pop our heads up for a moment and yell, 'Yeah! Take that, slightly reactionary book industry!'

Interestingly, I have just found myself using Scott's blog to gauge another quality besides lairiness. I'm now using the lesser known Pack Scale of Book-Plugging Magnanimity. Scott's recommended that his followers read various titles, besides the ones produced in his own book-mills, and now I want to do the same. But I only give myself about a six out of ten on the Pack Scale because the book happens to be written by a friend of mine. That's not why I'm recommending it - the book deserves recommendation purely on its merits - but I probably wouldn't have stumbled across it if I hadn't been looking out for the name.

So, the book is the <a href=""http://www.dbponline.co.uk/book_preview.asp?b_id=356"">Secret Language of the Renaissance</a>, by Richard Stemp, from Duncan Baird Publishers. And should you be interested, the book's title continues: Decoding the Greatest Age of Italian Art. It's what I'm sure its publishers' marketing team will hate me for calling a 'coffee-table book', but it's rather a fabulous one. It has many pretty pictures: every Renaissance painting and sculpture I've ever heard of (which turns out not to be that many) and several additional galleries full besides. It also has a great number of pretty words, all of which, so far, I'm delighted to say that I understand. It's so wonderfully readable that I could almost forget that I'm learning about art, because learning about art is not something I'm generally very good at. I spend a lot of my time studying, but I have some notable blindspots and this book fits neatly into one of them. When it comes to discovering art, as another friend of mine says, it's not something I do; it's not even something I want to do; but it's something I want to want to do. But now perhaps there's some hope. The Secret Language seems to have got me over the first hurdle very efficiently. My worry now is that I'll gather in all this new knowledge, be fascinated by it, and then forget it all. But even if I only retain a fraction of it, I'll be pleased. And one really can't go very far wrong in the glossy art book stakes for &pound;9.99 (Amazon's current price). I think it's safe to say that if you gave it as a gift, the recipient would never guess how little you'd spent on them.","","","","","2006-11-16","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

*Everybody* has one. Seriously, every time I wear it I see at least one other girl with one. It's about two years old from Oasis but the trend doesn't seem to be waning. I had to change tube carriages at last year's LBF because there was another publisher wearing one. And this winter it's started all over again - this week I've seen three others. 

It's quite a good way to meet new people, though, and a good ice breaker. I might launch a website called www.yourewearingthesamecoatasme.com and get cards printed and hand them to people when I see them in the coat. I might take photos of me and the people I meet and put them on my website. We could form a worldwide community of coatfriends&trade;. Such potential. 

I wonder how many Oasis sold and whether they're still living off the profits? Whether it caused a huge spike in sales which mess up their year-on-year sales? In trading meetings buyers always had to explain why their sales had missed targets (""it's colder than it was this time last year"", ""it's the Diana effect"" (no one went shopping for weeks after Diana died), ""this time last year it was the World Cup"" etc). Are they sitting in their meetings this year explaining why sales are down 1500% on the year because of ""the blue coat effect""?

<b>Idler at large turns to fiction </b>

James Bridle at Snowbooks has bought world rights in a first novel by Matthew De Abaitua, editor at large of the Idler and literary editor of Esquire.

De Abaitua's The Red Men is about a technology consultant who finds himself wrestling with his conscience when commissioned to work on a project with sinister aims. 'We're very excited about the book and plan a large amount of promotion to accompany it,' Bridle says.

Snowbooks will publish in autumn 2007. De Abaitua's agent is Sarah Such.

ERRATA: Please note that Matthew is <em>a former</em>, not the current, lit ed of Esquire, as wrongly stated in The Bookseller.","","","","","2006-11-17","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

...I think it's switching back to Illy coffee that's done it. That stuff is like perfectly roasted rocket fuel and it angries up the blood if you're not careful. So I respectfully blame Illy indirectly for the following:

The publishing industry seems to be full of people who are confidently dismissive of any electronic gadget that purports to do the job of a paper book. I in turn have been confidently dismissive of these people.

Two things annoy me about their position. Firstly, they tend to start with the idea that you'll never get rid of paper books completely (with which I completely agree) and skip straight to how that means electronic-book-readers will never amount to much. Secondly, they rely on what you might call the emotional qualities of paper to bolster their position. That argument seems to run: because everyone loves warm, natural paper books and hates cold, soulless gadgets, the paper book's position is safe. And I generally reply, 'you mean the way everyone loves the ungainly, toilet-paper bulk of airport blockbusters and hates the sleek, pebble-from-a-Zen-garden perfection of the latest iPods?' If I'm being petty, I like to imagine that these are the people who swore never to switch from records to CDs - and then did - and proudly renounced the mobile phone about five years back and now can't live without one. I'm not saying the world is better because it switched to CDs and everyone bought a cell phone; I'm just pointing out that it happened, over the objections and counter-predictions of many.","Likewise, it's not that I'm in love with the idea of electronic-book-readers, I just don't like the complacency (and what sometimes feels like smugness) with which their approach is ignored. For instance, I'd have more time for the rampant papyrophiles if they used the following argument on me:

<font color=""darkblue"">You know Rob, a lot of people think that paper is just a white background for applying ink to, but the fact is that paper interacts with light in strange and useful ways. Paper is made up of microscopic tubes of a plant material called cellulose which happen to be transparent. Paper only looks opaque because the light that hits it is being bent in all directions, so instead of looking at a sheet of glass, its more like a frosted window (plus papermakers chuck in a handful of china clay to make the white brighter). At the microscopic level, paper is a tangle of tiny fibre-optic strands. The light that goes into one end of a strand comes out the other end, most likely going in some completely different direction. Since the strands are all pointing in different directions that means that no matter what angle the light is coming from, or how strong it is, it tends to get evened out and sent back in all directions, almost as though the paper itself was glowing, usually with no glare or reflections. Paper takes light from harsh point-sources like a bulb, or blindingly strong sources like the sun, and turns it into a soft, even backlight behind the text. Simply putting ink on a white surface looks terrible by comparison and that's why even the best electronic displays fall short of paper when it comes to displaying the written word.</font>

I think e-book sceptics would be on firmer ground with an argument like that. They should point out that decades of expensive R&D have yet to produce a definitive rival to something that literally grows on trees. Paper's optical advantages do a more thorough job of driving off challengers than does the typical reader's supposed love of conventionally made books, because while I might love my 1889 edition of Three Men in a Boat, with the first owner's name written in black fountain pen ink that's now turning brown with age, I don't love unwieldy, wibalin-covered hardbacks at &pound;15 when what I really wanted was a compact &pound;8 paperback, and I don't love most of the gaudy-covered fibrous doorstops that gradually fill up my bookshelves until I give them away. 

Personally, I believe there are still lots of reasons to prefer paper books. But Philips, Sony, E Ink Corporation and others are hard at work trying to transfer the most desirable qualities of paper books to electronic-readers (as well as inventing a few new features along the way). Instead of an LCD screen, Sony's book-reading-gizmos have electronic paper displays. Millions of tiny beads, too small to see individually, are arranged in a sheet. On one side they're white and on the other side they're black, and the circuitry built into the display can rotate them, controlling which side you see. When a patch of display has its white side up it looks rather like blank paper, and when the black side is up it looks rather like ink. And this isn't some flickery, glowing computer screen. It appears inert, dead; it just sits there, looking like slightly weird ink on slightly weird paper: just a page from a weird-looking book. But touch the control on the side and now it looks like a different page from that book. My reader isn't the latest version, but you can read it in bright sunshine or by the light of a bedside lamp. It weighs about as much as a big paperback and can hold goodness knows how many words. Zillions, if you buy a big enough memory stick (the little deely-bob that stores the words). Naturally, the new Sony readers that have just come out will be better still. Snowbooks will get a few, to see if we like them, to see how the technology's progressing, to judge how frightened we should be - and to see if they spark any great ideas about how to keep profits up should paper lose a significant piece of its market share. It seems unlikely that we'll be able to answer that question all by ourselves, so for purely selfish reasons it would be nice if those with their heads in the sand removed them and got to work on inventing the next generation of publishing. It's either that or open a rare vinyl shop.

Phew. Probably time for some camomile tea after that.","","","","2006-11-18","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

So I was invited to give a talk the other day at an event called Inspire and Connect, which did what it said on the tin. A few people have asked to see what I said, so here it is - a collaborative effort between me and Rob, but mostly Rob - reproduced by the miracle of modern blogging. Bear in mind that this was for a non-publishing audience so apologies for the grandma-egg-suckiness of it. 

<font color=""gray"">""Three years ago I had an important decision to make. There was a lot to weigh up and most of it depended on predicting the future in an industry I didn't know much about. So I took a deep breath and made a choice. In the end the choice I made drastically lowered my income, scrambled my long-time career plans and took me away from a blue-chip company to work long hours in the corner of a grubby rented office where the heating was broken, the printer rarely worked and the air-conditioning consisted of opening a window to let the traffic noise in.</font>","<font color=""gray"">That was three years ago and a lot has happened since then. Now our offices are a bit more cosy, there are five of us - and my long-term financial future could now be described as 'uncertain' rather than 'downright precarious'. </font>

<font color=""gray"">And since I've been asked to talk about what inspired me to leave Deloitte and start Snowbooks, I thought I'd give a nod to good business practice, and attempt what I believe we used to call a 'post-implementation review' of my decision. </font>

<font color=""gray"">And it might surprise you to discover that by any of the measures I learned in business school, I made the wrong choice. </font>

<font color=""gray"">Although my company is doing quite nicely, it will have to do a lot better if it's to provide me with a higher lifetime income and a better pension than if I'd stayed among the blue chips. And even then, a small new company is always more of a gamble than a large mature one.</font>

<font color=""gray"">Of course there are other factors to take into account besides the 'risk-adjusted net-present-value' of my decision. There's the fact that I was miserable before and now I'm happy. There's the fact that I now tend to find my working day satisfying rather than frustrating. There's the fact that my carefully chosen staff are fun to be around. In fact even my suppliers, believe it or not, are selected according to whether I like working with them. Naturally my first thought is whether they're good value for money, but if I don't like dealing with them then all that's irrelevant: I find someone else. It's one advantage of being a small fish in a big pond: there are nearly always alternatives.</font>

<font color=""gray"">And while we're on the subject of success, you might find it interesting to hear about a discussion I had the other day with a finance director who was frankly rather scathing about Snowbooks. He acknowledged that the fundamentals were sound, but in his mind, we were paying our staff too much, not diversifying fast enough, we were worrying about people when we should be worrying about profits, and we weren't taking full advantage of our opportunities to raise expansion capital and grow the business more quickly. </font>

<font color=""gray"">It was a struggle to explain to him why I didn't want to follow his advice and I'm not sure in the end that he understood. It wasn't that his suggestions hadn't already occurred to me. And it wasn't that I failed to understand the reasons behind them. The problem was that his advice didn't fit with my plans for the future of the company and I couldn't think how to explain those plans without sounding hopelessly unworldly or naive. Maybe the rest of this talk can be the explanation I would have given him if I'd had a little more time to think about it.</font>

<font color=""gray"">The first thing I should have reminded him of is that financial success is just a way to make life more pleasant. Nothing more. It's a way to make life more pleasant. No one in their right mind would swap a happy life for a miserable one with more money. Maybe there are loopholes, like what if a dying relative needed an expensive operation, but then trying to save dying relatives isn't about making money; it's about the things we value more than money.</font>

<font color=""gray"">So while it may sound mushy or idealistic, I'm not interested in running a company unless it makes me proud and improves the quality of my life. Yes, it can do that partly by making money, so that I can buy shoes and maybe a pony, but it can also do that by giving me a wonderful team to work with, and interesting projects, and a harmonious working environment, and a proving-ground for my business ideas, and last but not least, the adoration and envy of my peers. What the FD didn't grasp the other day was that if I'm going to throw away all those non-financial things that I enjoy so much, I'm going to want a hell of a lot more money in return - enough for literally hundreds of pairs of shoes and a whole herd of ponies. And, frankly, the changes he was proposing wouldn't nearly compensate me for the drop in my quality of life.</font>

<font color=""gray"">Hopefully when I explain things in those terms, my priorities make sense to you all. But perhaps you think because fuzzy concepts like personal pride and job satisfaction are involved, that makes Snowbooks more of a hobby than a real business. Commercially-run companies have commercial goals, don't they? And heartless old economics tells us that if your employees are happy, you could get away with paying them a bit less.</font>

<font color=""gray"">I think most of us are just not used to the idea of ordinary firms having non-financial goals. It doesn't seem right. The typical lifecycle of a growing business eventually sees it trading its shares on the stock market - and at that point its shareholders are interested in it purely as an investment. There are a few companies that are owned by their staff, and they tend to place some emphasis on employee satisfaction. But most big businesses are owned by stock market investors and so 'return on investment' is their guiding principle. And that's the world Snowbooks exists in. Our competitors are companies whose first and only priority is financial success. Which leaves us at a disadvantage, since we're also relying on financial success to keep us going - only we've burdened ourselves with all these extra, non-financial goals. If you think about it, for us to stand any chance of survival, we actually have to be more profitable than a comparable firm with lower salaries and a clearer profit motive, because we're planning to 'waste' some of that income before it reaches the bottom line. We have to try harder because our profits have to go further.</font>

<font color=""gray"">So that's exactly what we do. We innovate to an extent that's frightening in a traditionally conservative industry, and we take advantage of every piece of big-business best-practice that we can, even though firms our size are often working off the backs of envelopes. We have state of the art IT - beyond state of the art in fact, for publishers. Our processes are better than anyone else's. Our lead and turnaround times are a fraction of our competitors', our standards are higher and our unit costs are tighter.</font>

<font color=""gray"">I've heard the phrase Our People Are Our Greatest Asset so many times from so many firms who didn't mean it that it tends to make me feel a little bit queasy. But not only do we pay over the odds; we've actually structured our firm to make the work more satisfying. Each project manager follows one book through from acquisition to publication - overseeing everything - so that when they hold the finished paperback in their hands they know it was them who turned it from a scrappy manuscript into a successful title. Understanding exactly what you've contributed and being able to hold the result in your hands is a big part of job satisfaction. We even let each project manager pick their own books, reasoning that if you have to live with it for the next year and a half, you'll only pick titles you love and for which you have a genuine passion.</font>

<font color=""gray"">Naturally our jack-of-all-trades approach sacrifices the production-line efficiency of Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford on which most modern business is based. But so far we've found that talent and motivation trumps over-specialisation and functional silos every time. The average age of our team is twenty-five and each of them can not only manage a title through to publication, they can perform every task along the way. No one in a traditional publishing company can do what they do, not as fast, not as well and not without a team of people working for them - and certainly not at age twenty-five. And what's more they know it. They know that at their age they have as much experience as a department head in a larger firm. </font>

<font color=""gray"">Which makes me feel good. I'm treating my staff better than I was treated at their age and they're responding by beating my expectations of them. </font>

<font color=""gray"">Now as you can imagine there are all sorts of problems with our approach, for instance it's very difficult for us to have a focused list of titles - say all crime or all business books. But we worked out in advance that the customer didn't care which publisher's brand was on the spine of the book they were buying. Only the retailers cared, because each of our books was the province of a different buyer. So we did something that retailers tell us had never done before: we put together sales packs that provided each buyer with the exact information they needed to make a decision on our books. It sounds totally obvious, but very few publishers understand the book business from the retail buyer's point of view. I had a slight advantage in that I used to be one. So when we presented our first sales pack to Waterstones, their buying manager was so delighted that he told me none of their other  publishers had ever provided that level of information.</font>

<font color=""gray"">I'm telling you this not because I hope it will impress you, but because it illustrates how breaking the rules can be a good thing. I have an unconventional view of success and if I want to achieve it then I have to take an unconventional view of running my business. Because my goals are less commercial than other publishers, my tactics need to be more commercial. It's hard work having warm and fuzzy values because they cost money, but I happen to think they're worth it. For me, any victory would be hollow if I achieved it by breaking my own rules about what's important. </font>

<font color=""gray"">Each of you will have different views on your responsibilities as an employer. And you'll have your own personal definition of success. If those views happen to mesh well with the culture of the companies you currently work for then you're on to a good thing. If they don't, I would strongly urge you to spend some time thinking about what matters to you.</font>

<font color=""gray"">I couldn't find a workplace where the culture fitted me well enough, so I created my own. If I'd stayed where I was, I might have been successful in the eyes of those around me, but since it wasn't my definition of success, I wouldn't have found it satisfying. The money would have been nice, but I'd never get those years of my life back. This way I don't have to put off being happy. I don't have to make a deal with myself, where I tell myself that the next promotion or the next pay rise will somehow make up for feeling frustrated and unfulfilled. I'm doing what I want to be doing each day. So I'm not counting on my future to make up for the present, and that takes a lot of pressure off me. It also means - and you might have to take this on faith if it sounds too outlandish - but it also means that even if Snowbooks goes under, I'll still consider that it was the right path to choose. I'll be able to look back on it all, however it turns out, and say that it was an adventure worth having, that I did it for the right reasons and that I treated those around me decently, even when I could have got away with less. That happens to be my definition of success: something I'll be glad I did however it turns out. And I would humbly suggest that you apply a similar definition in your own lives. Thanks for listening.""</font>","","","","2006-11-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

"40773","","1","How to cut things out","Publish","true","So I'm often talking to people about how we work at Snowbooks, and I say 'and the team does all their own cover design and illustrations,' and the person nods, and later in the conversation the person says 'so who does your cover design?' and I say that the team does it, the same person who's the editor and the typesetter and the marketeer and the production manager. And the person looks a bit confused, and then says 'that's impossible.' It seems a very hard thing for people to grasp. So here is the first in an occasional series of how to do things in Photoshop and Indesign, so that you can see HowBloodyEasy&trade; it is.

You know, nothing delights and surprises me more than being mentioned in the same sentence as people I admire, *by* people I admire. From today's Independent, Boyd Tonkin's A Week in Books column:

""Publishing, which retains the allure of a sort of highbrow showbiz, attracts dedicated wannabes. It also allows talented veterans ousted from, or unhappy in, conglomerate companies to set up as smaller, fiercer rivals to ex-employers. This year, the former Orion chief Anthony Cheetham has planted the acorn of Quercus Books, and Philip Gwyn Jones's Portobello has made a stylish bow. Alma Books has launched with a bold list, Friday Books has begun to transform blogs into paper, Snow Books settles steadily, and Old Street Publishing promises interesting new directions.""

There are few better starts to a weekend than reading that manner of thing - and it was excellent timing as my mum's just called from her local bookstore to say she can't find a single one of our books. Thank you, Mr. Tonkin, for raising my spirits.

Here's a thing to ponder on: it's the early days of the twentieth century and you're a sheet music supplier. You're vaguely aware that the U.S. Supreme Court has cancelled Tesla's patent and awarded it to Marconi. Though the exact culprit may be in doubt, <i>someone</i> has clearly invented radio. Now you hear that an inventor called Lee DeForest has used radio to spread early election results through New York as Woodrow Wilson squeaks past Charles Hughes to take a second term as president. And in between the election results, it appears that DeForest has been broadcasting songs - old patriotic favourites for the most part but still, it sets you thinking. It could just as easily have been something from Irving Berlin or Jerome Kern. Currently, ""It's a long way to Tipperary"" is flying off your shelves, at sixpence a time, thank you very much. It seems that DeForest was broadcasting his music to around 7000 listeners. If he'd sold them the music instead, that would be &pound;175 - a year's sales in four minutes for one song! And DeForest played at least half a dozen tunes. Now granted, hearing the song once isn't the same as owning the sheet music, but on the other hand, on the radio you could hear it performed by Florrie Forde herself, backed by the real live Connaught Rangers. So let's split the difference and imagine charging the radio listeners a penny a song. In a few years, the nation could tune in and you'd be bringing in some pretty useful money - there are 42 million Brits according to the 1911 census and most of them like music. Call it a shilling a day from five million households. Hmm, on the other hand not many could afford that. On the other other hand, give all that music away for free and you not only miss out on an exchequer full of money, but you crush the sheet music industry flat and no one gets rich. After all, who's going to buy music if they can hear it on the radio whenever they wish for free?","So enough imagining. The fun question is, who would have thought that giving away free performances of the most popular tunes played by the original artists themselves to anyone who was listening all FOR FREE, would somehow result in a massive market for selling those same recordings? Not me. The music industry boomed <i>as a result</i> of broadcasting tunes for free every day, and not in spite of it - partly because music wasn't quite free enough: you couldn't choose when a song would come on, and you couldn't play it ten times in a row with a radio. And maybe it gave fashion a chance to take hold, where a song could get old in weeks instead of years. Mainly it just seemed to turn music into such a gigantic phenomenon that everyone had a fair chance of getting rich - even the sheet music vendors (for a while).

What worries me is that I would have been on the wrong side. I would have been trying to prevent radio stations giving away what I was trying to sell. I would have seen the size of their audience and been unhappy with the relative pittance I was paid each time they played a song I owned. But how unusual were the conditions that lead to radio's impact on music? Showing movies on TV - even when they can be recorded - seems as much like an advert for buying the DVD as it is a replacement for it.

When the same thing comes up in the book world, it's also difficult to know which way to jump. How wise is it to charge for paper books but give away the electronic versions? What counts as free publicity and what's simply lost revenue? Maybe we should give away film, TV and serialisation rights instead of charging for them, reasoning that overall takings will be higher. It's easy to squeeze a market too tightly, trying to control it rather than letting it grow and trusting that in the chaotic expansion there'll be a lucrative niche for us. In fact most of the money in the music industry, and I suspect around 50% of the money in the film industry goes not into bringing us new talent and new 'product' but in trying to influence which products we spend our money on. A small number of big blockbusters allows for far greater control - and thus greater money-making opportunities - than a large number of low-profile works, any one of which might suddenly capture the public's affections. And if these things are left to the public, then how are we to have the Burger King tie-in ready to go at the right moment? And the lead times on merchandising don't allow for unplanned successes.

The history of music, film and to a lesser extent books has been a struggle for control. But in the world of music a good garage band can now record, mix, master and mass produce an album without outside help and for very manageable sums of money. And hi-def video cameras are edging down towards the thousand pound mark. Shoot your own footage and everything else can be done on high-end PCs and Macs - editing, color-timing, ADR, scoring, chromakey, rendering, DVD mastering - and by 'high-end' I mean the sort of thing touted for yuppies to play Half Life 2 on.

It's fun to imagine a world where the 'authors' of music and film 'disintermediate' the traditional industries and go direct to their audience. More choice, lower costs all round, fewer boy bands and bad summer blockbusters. To stay in the game the big players would really have to deliver. I've already posted about how publishers could become the ox bow lakes of the book world, when the course of the written word simply jumps its banks and goes on without us.

I'm sure the sheet music industry still exists in the 21st century, but it's not an area I imagine new investment being drawn to. iPod clones, on the other hand, will do well this Christmas. What I'm trying to work out is how all this applies to the future history of books.","","","","2006-11-25","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

<b>Simon Callow</b>
<font color=""gray"">""Bruce Benderson's harrowingly autobiographical The Romanian (Snowbooks) is one of the most devastating and unsparing accounts of amour fou I have ever read, providing at the same time an extraordinary glimpse into Romania's past and present. I read it at the same time as Andrew Holleran's Grief (Hyperion), a novel which - haunted by reflections on Henry Adams as a widower and Mary Lincoln's aimless life after her husband's assassination - deals calmly and wisely, in exquisite pellucid prose, with some fundamental truths. Both these books deal with gay life, but from diametrically opposite points of view. Finally, Ian Buruma's fine and subtle Murder in Amsterdam: The Death of Theo van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance (Atlantic), while specifically and illuminatingly about some Dutch responses to Muslim extremism, has chilling resonances for all of us.""</font>

I've had a few conversations with fellow publishers which drifted into technical waters... and at that point typically ran aground. Generally speaking, publishers aren't geeks and geeks aren't publishers. However, since the Nineties, geeks have been quietly revolutionising the world with their fancy Internets and their web thingamajigs and what-have-yous. Sometimes these new-fangled notions impinge directly upon the world of publishing and at other times they simply loom on the horizon, where they could be either icebergs or lovely tropical islands serving fruity cocktails. Without closer inspection it's impossible to tell. But who among us busy publishing types has the time or the stomach to read big thick books with acronym-heavy titles (and little in the way of humour unless you count cryptic references to obscure sci-fi shows). Well, fortunately for you all, the position of Snowbooks Chairman is not what you might call 'a proper job' and leaves me with some time on my hands. And so I have taken it upon myself to swim far out into the turbid waters of information technology and bring you back the following exotic delicacy. I have plucked each and every thorn from it and I can almost guarantee that it won't cause you any discomfort. To give my last overworked metaphor a breather, and to saddle up a fresh one, it's web technology in comfortable slippers beside a cozy fire.

I've been quite enjoying the increasingly apoplectic opinion pieces by salaried reviewers. Sheesh, defensive much. Still, all that goes out the window when someone bothers to write a really lovely<a href=""http://www.trashionista.com/2006/11/book_review_plo_1.html#more""> review </a>about one of our own books - a ""wonderfully funny...enormously satisfying, well-written and perfectly-plotted novel with a main character who's as lovable and funny as Bridget Jones - if a tad more prone to a hot flush..."" that was awarded 5 stars by the lovely ladies at Trashionista. Quite right too.

"40783","","1","My Christmas Present List","Publish","true","So you know how there's this custom at Christmas time for friends to bestow gifts on other friends? And how sometimes it's hard to figure out what to buy for your friends? Well, my friends, have I got a deal for you, seeing as how I like you so much. If you buy one of the following books, not only is that the best Christmas present you could possibly get for me, I won't even ask for the book! That's right! Think of the savings on gift wrap, postage, or how much lighter your bag will be next time we meet up - none of that cumbersome carrying presents around lark. 

So nip into your local Waterstone's / online bookshop / local bookshop and buy one of the following. Then email me and I'll put on a big show of saying how thoughtful and lovely you are, and it's just what I wanted, and I'll treasure it forever. Then you can go home and read it yourself. Everyone's a winner.

Hooray, signs of life! Finally sales appear to be taking off a bit. We have had excellent reorders on our fiction and the Omnibus still hangs in there at number 10 in the chart. Phewo. There's still some work to be done on the non-fiction, so please do consider some of our books for Christmas presents. At least I can ask this now without a kind of warbling desperation in my voice. 

I have been in or around retail for over ten years and *every* Christmas I panic. And *every* Christmas it turns out OK. When will I learn?","","","","","2006-12-01","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"
"40785","","1","#2 in the TooEasyByHalf series: building a website","Publish","true","<img alt=""toolbox.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/toolbox.jpg"" width=""100"" height=""81"" />
This one is for my dad who has had to put up with Frontpage and other web editors for far too long. Web editor programmes are like those bookkeeping packages which have lots of bold primary colours, rounded edges, oversized 'click here' buttons and screens that look like cheques. They look easy to use, but the childish, oversimplified interface just confuses me. I want to understand the double entry journal; they have five multicoloured icons. Quickbooks, I'm looking at you. 

Anyhoo, this tutorial is nothing to do with bookkeeping. This is how I write websites. I am the absolute opposite of a techie, except I am very stingy and impatient and I'd rather spend an hour or two reading big thick IT books than pay, or wait for, someone to do things for me. Honestly, if I can do it, anyone can. I guess that reading this through will take about an hour, but if you're of a mind to write your own site it might save you about a day, which isn't a bad payoff. Obviously, if you have no intention of ever using html, move along, please, and don't click to read more. 

So, here we go. One fresh new website, coming on up.","<em><strong>1) Get all the software you need all lined up.</strong></em>
It's all free! Yey. You need three types of software:

<strong>a) A text editor.</strong>
Notepad comes free with all MS Office installations, and it's handy. However, I use ConTEXT to edit html, because it colours things in nicely which helps me to understand what's going on. <a href=""http://www.context.cx/component/option,com_docman/Itemid,48/"">Download for free</a>; click on DOWNLOAD in the box near the top of the screen. It's only 2mb.

<strong>b) An image editor. </strong>
Photoshop is the only option here. You must have eet. There is a perfectly functional but slightly cut down version called Photoshop Elements for about &pound;60 (you can get it from <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-5-PC/dp/B000IB9QXI/sr=8-1/qid=1165070155/ref=pd_ka_1/026-8453309-1302843?ie=UTF8&s=software"">Amazon).</a> Life without Photoshop is a frustrating mess so you should have it anyway. 

<strong>c) An ftp manager. </strong>
For some random reason the pipe that goes out of our office doesn't allow us to access FTP sites at the moment. We upgraded something, which often means we've gone backwards in capability. So we use <a href=""http://www.net2ftp.com"">www.net2ftp.com</a> and it works fine. You'll need to know the ftp url, username and password of your site but the initial email you got from your hosting provider will contain that. So you don't actually need to 'get' net2ftp as it's a website. 

Good, that's all the kit got. 

<em><strong>2) Write the code. </strong> </em>
Rather than start from scratch, half-inch the code from a website you like the look of and you can get the CSS for. (It's not really stealing as webpages are in the public domain.) In a browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, whatever although Firefox is a million times more functional than IE) go to the website, then View, Source. The webpage's code pops up in Notepad, usually, or another text editor - it doesn't matter. To save you the bother of getting at both the code and the css, which is tricky to find, <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/fakeindex.html"">here</a> is Snowbooks' homepage code. (First, create a new folder on your PC called, erm, 'website'. Right mouse and click 'save as' on the link otherwise it will open in a browser.  Save as 'index.html' in your new folder. Open the file in your new application, ConTEXT, or in Notepad if you ignored my advice.)

Cast your eye over the code and at the same time have www.snowbooks.com open. Hopefully you'll get the gist of which bit of HTML is telling the browser to do what, because the words you see on the webpage are contained in the HTML. This is how I learned HTML and I like to think it's the modern equivalent of learning French, for example, from a French edition of an English book you know off by heart - except HTML is way easier. 

For instance, take this bit of code: 
< div class=""sidebarblock"">
< p>< strong>< a href=""authors.html"">Authors< /a>< /strong> Looking to get published? < a href=""authors.html"">Read our information for authors.< /a>< /p>
< /div >

[Phew, writing this tutorial in an editor which uses html is exhausting. I have tried all sorts of ways to get that to actually look like code. In the end I put a space after every <, otherwise it formats as below.]

<div class=""sidebarblock"">
<p><strong><a href=""authors.html"">Authors</a></strong> Looking to get published? <a href=""authors.html"">Read our information for authors.</a></p>
</div>

The bit where it says 
< strong>< a href=""authors.html"">Authors< /a>< /strong> 
means: format this next bit in bold (strong), make it link to the page author.html when you click on it, write the word Authors, end the link, end the bold formatting. As Rob said in his <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2006/11/computers_just_what_is_all_the.html"">XML tutorial</a>, it's like the old rules for speechwriting: tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you've told them. HTML always has this structure:

< tag>Hello world!< /tag>

(again, please ignore the spaces). 

So, you have the snowbooks homepage open in ConTEXT. Find where the words that you see on snowbooks.com appear in the html. Try overwriting them with some of your own content. Save the file. Go to windows explorer, double click on your index.html file and you'll see the results of your amends. You'll also see that your webpage looks much less beautiful than ours, which leads us nicely on to the next part of this tutorial... 

<em><strong>3) Design the webpage. </strong></em>
It's a kind of fundamental rule: design should be separate from content. That's why you don't see many instructions in the html we've looked at about font size, colour, images or spacing. If you look at the top of the html you'll see this: 

< style type=""text/css"" media=""all"" title=""Snowstyle"">
@ import ""styles.css"";
< /style>

which is the instruction to import a stylesheet. <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/fakestyles.css"">Download snowbooks' style sheet </a>- again, right mouse and save as styles.css in the same folder as index.html. Open it in ConTEXT. 

If you're beady you'll see that there are references in the css that are the same as the html. For example, in the html we have 

< div class=""sidebarblock"">
< p>< strong>< a href=""authors.html"">Authors< /a>< /strong> Looking to get published? < a href=""authors.html"">Read our information for authors.< /a>< /p>
< /div>

That 'sidebarblock' bit features in the css too. In fact, that's where the html looks for further instructions - and here they are: 

.sidebarblock {
	width: 195px;
	background: transparent url('../siteimages/sidebarspacer.jpg') no-repeat;
	padding: 40px 0px 20px 0px;
	}

It says - when this style is applied to the text, make the text 195 pixels wide, find the image called sidebarspacer.jpg, indent it by 40 pixels on the left and 20 pixels on the right. 

The sidebarspacer image is this: <img alt=""sidebarspacer.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/sidebarspacer.jpg"" width=""195"" height=""24"" /> so you can see on snowbooks.com where it features. 

So, next stage: 

<em><strong>4) Amend the images. </strong></em>
Again, why start from scratch? Hover your mouse over one of the images on snowbooks.com, right mouse, click 'save image as' and save. Open up in photoshop and overwrite that image with whatever you like. The beauty is that all the dimensions are accurate. Once you're done changing the images, resave -with the same name so the html know what to look up - in the same folder as your html and css. Try opening the index.html file now, from windows explorer. There are probably one or two disasters on there, but that's the nature of the thing - maybe you now have enough understanding of how html and css work together to start tinkering. 

There are some fantastically useful resources on the net.  <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"">This</a> is the best, in my view. 

<em><strong>5) Upload the site</strong></em>

Once you're done tinkering, use net2ftp.com to upload all the files to the same folder - the .css, .html and the images. To write this tutorial I created a new website myself, and <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/love2fight"">here is the result</a>. Nothing like the Snowbooks website, but the only things that have changed are the images and the text. It took about two hours, including writing this blog post.

"40786","","1","Kicking ASS","Publish","true","<img alt=""mtlogo.gif"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/mtlogo.gif"" width=""166"" height=""79"" />

I always knew it. I have ASS - and now the world knows too. Without a hint of a snigger (although I know you're laughing, Emma D, I know) an article in this week's Management Today covers ASS - Accelerated Success Syndrome. And guess who's case study number 4? Oh yes. I quote:

<font color=""gray"">""MT has identified a generation of high achievers who suffer from the modern malady of ASS... ASS sufferers didn't start out disillusioned... ASS sufferers have no regrets on quitting corporate life..."" </font>and so it goes on. I can't copy out any more, I'm laughing too much. Genius. 

Anyway, [dries eyes], aside from the excellent acronym entertainment, it's a really good article. I would direct you to it but it's only in the print edition (December 2006). Oh, and there's a really flattering photo of me because the nice photographer cleverly concealed most of my hips behind some books for which I will love him forever. (Although facewise I look a bit like an angry hamster.) Some quotes about me: 

<font color=""gray"">""Emma Barnes, 31, joined the Kingfisher fast-track scheme in 1999...she was so keen to start that she volunteered to join the business eight weeks early."" </font>

Yes, yes I did. Oh, if I knew then what I know now. 

<font color=""gray"">""Her swift promotion through the ranks led her to become B&Q's youngest ever buyer at just 25. 'Kingfisher's tag line for the management development scheme was senior management within seven to 10 years,' she says. 'It was very compelling.' But her big promotion left her cold. 'I was absolutely over the moon for a day. The I had a huge crash because that was everything I had set my sights on and I had achieved it, and nothing had changed - life went on and I was still working really hard.'""</font>

Compare that to the high I had after we won Small Publisher of the Year. Now *that* was a worthwhile achievement and far from delivering a fleeting high has sustained me ever since. Anyway. I like the next bit best:

<font color=""gray"">""Already feeling disoriented, Barnes suffered a severe setback when a strategy she had masterminded went wrong in implementation. 'All of the people who said it was the best strategy forgot they'd said that; they all distanced themselves. I got a two on my performance appraisal and suddenly all bets were off. I felt absolutely abandoned and devastated.' The experience was her first introduction to how a company actually works.""</font>

Yep, 'how a company actually works'. Oh, except...what's that? We appear to be building and running a company that <em>doesn't </em>work like that? It<em> is</em> possible; it makes<em> better</em> business sense and it is <em>unforgivable</em> that the majority of companies are run the way they are. Don't stand for it. Don't develop a thick enough hide to cope with it. Don't get bullied. Walk. Get out of there. Leave them to it. Find another way to spend your life because it really will be time to retire before you know it and what will you have done?","","","","","2006-12-05","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Yes, the rumours are true. Snowbooks are thoroughly chuffed to announce that we now have a grand, whiz-bang, fully interactive and rather pretty presence in the much-discussed online world Second Life.

My 'to do' box is nearly empty. And my 'to do' list only has 20 things on it. Admittedly some of those things will each take about six months, but that's ok. That's my new pen there, too, which Rob got me for my birthday. I can now write nice, neat letters to people, and sign letters in prussian blue ink like a proper lady grown up. Coupled with the fact that I can also use the prefix 'Mrs', that gives me practically invincible levels of social standing. 

News from SnowTowers: two things of ours appeared in The Bookseller this week. One: a brief article about James' Second Life launch. Two: a letter following up on the two letters about BIC codes. Click below the line for the unedited version (that makes it sound racey. It's just more rounded.) 

Also we have an excellent advert in Private Eye for <em>How Very Interesting</em>. This is advertising's last chance; if we don't get lots of sales from this we really aren't going to advertise again, ever, ever, because this is a perfect ad in the perfect publication for the perfect product. I will keep you posted. 

<img alt=""cook.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/cook.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""300"" />","To the editor of the Bookseller: 

Howard Willows wrote in recently to respond to Robin Tobin on the subject of BIC classification codes. Robin was disappointed that BIC codes don't better reflect the way customers mentally group books. Howard pointed out that BIC codes are a kind of lingua franca for supply chain data - it's not a sales grouping or a customer-led classification - it's intended for internal use between publishers and retailers, so naturally it doesn't attempt to reflect customer thinking. But that still leaves me puzzled. Because it's for use out of sight of the customer, I can accept that BIC codes must be modelled on the internal data requirements of the supply chain. And if they happen to be at odds with customer thinking, then too bad: it's not about them. But what are the internal data requirements of the book supply chain? And what would the classifications they generate be useful for? I hope I'm not missing the obvious, but all I can come up with is that the retailer would use those groupings for aggregating performance data and for planning ranges - in other words for putting together their customer offer and then reviewing its success. That's a highly customer-dependent activity. Publishers too might look at which classifications their titles fall into as a way of gauging the strengths, and the gaps, in their list, as well as identifying where the profits are coming from: in other words, range planning and sales analysis. And both of those activities are best done with a classification based on the way customers mentally group books and then make their purchases. 
 
Whether creating such a classification is a task that BIC - or anyone else for that matter - can truly succeed at is a different question. It's likely to be a moving target, for a start. But that's slightly off the point. I'm still at a loss to understand what internal supply chain use Howard has in mind that takes precedence over a customer and sales led approach. In the age of category management, when retailers reorganise their processes - even their office space - around the way customers group products, I think that the necessity that has drawn BIC away from thinking about the customer had better be an awfully good one.

Because our distributors, LBS, look after our inventory, ship our books, bill our customers and then collect the precious, precious money, they know how our business is doing in quite a bit of detail. Kind people that they are, they share this with us by giving us access to various reports about stock and sales and debtors. In fact they let us have access to three different systems: the live, production machine that offers ugly, but very up-to-date, text-only reports - think computer display from 1985. Next is a repository of prettier, off-the-shelf reports on their report2web system. And finally, they even have a cognos-fronted data warehouse where you can drag and drop to your heart's content until you've made the report of your dreams. More than enough for anyone... you might think.

So what have I been doing this week? I've been writing a little application that takes their pretty reports, downloads them, strips out the formatting and indents, the titles and sub-titles, the various other foibles, then fills in the blanks, labels everything clearly and stores it in a database - one that resides on our server. The slightly weird, slightly sad thing is that at the end of all my effort, I end up with something that I suspect looks exactly like the raw data LBS produce those pretty reports from. Somewhere, they have a database which looks a lot like mine - except theirs contains other people's data too, so they can't let me have access to it. If the report2web system is matter, then I'm trying to create anti-matter - so that when my application meets theirs the whole lot cancels out and we're left with the raw data that we need to create our own, in-house reports. Which makes me kind of the opposite of a programmer. An anti-programmer? A software reverse-engineer? And to think I planned to be a good, old-fashioned astronaut.","","","","","2006-12-10","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

1) I still mainly only listen to the Cure. Sure, I listen to a lot of other stuff, but not with any level of dedication. I listen to Cure songs most days. I am a freak.

2) I don't like road movies.

<strong>Part I
The Air-Ship</strong>
Imagine, if you can, a small room, hexagonal in shape, like the cell of a bee. It is lighted neither by window nor by lamp, yet it is filled with a soft radiance. There are no apertures for ventilation, yet the air is fresh. There are no musical instruments, and yet, at the moment that my meditation opens, this room is throbbing with melodious sounds. An armchair is in the centre, by its side a reading-desk - that is all the furniture. And in the armchair there sits a swaddled lump of flesh - a woman, about five feet high, with a face as white as a fungus. It is to her that the little room belongs.","An electric bell rang. 

The woman touched a switch and the music was silent. 

'I suppose I must see who it is', she thought, and set her chair in motion. The chair, like the music, was worked by machinery and it rolled her to the other side of the room where the bell still rang importunately. 

'Who is it?' she called. Her voice was irritable, for she had been interrupted often since the music began. She knew several thousand people, in certain directions human intercourse had advanced enormously. 

But when she listened into the receiver, her white face wrinkled into smiles, and she said: 

'Very well. Let us talk, I will isolate myself. I do not expect anything important will happen for the next five minutes - for I can give you fully five minutes, Kuno. Then I must deliver my lecture on ""Music during the Australian Period"".' 

She touched the isolation knob, so that no one else could speak to her. Then she touched the lighting apparatus, and the little room was plunged into darkness. 

'Be quick!' she called, her irritation returning. 'Be quick, Kuno; here I am in the dark wasting my time.' 

But it was fully fifteen seconds before the round plate that she held in her hands began to glow. A faint blue light shot across it, darkening to purple, and presently she could see the image of her son, who lived on the other side of the earth, and he could see her. 

'Kuno, how slow you are.' 

He smiled gravely. 

'I really believe you enjoy dawdling.' 

'I have called you before, mother, but you were always busy or isolated. I have something particular to say.' 

'What is it, dearest boy? Be quick. Why could you not send it by pneumatic post?' 

'Because I prefer saying such a thing. I want----' 

'Well?' 

'I want you to come and see me.' 

Vashti watched his face in the blue plate. 

'But I can see you!' she exclaimed. 'What more do you want?' 

'I want to see you not through the Machine,' said Kuno. 'I want to speak to you not through the wearisome Machine.' 

'Oh, hush!' said his mother, vaguely shocked. 'You mustn't say anything against the Machine.' 

'Why not?' 

'One mustn't.' 

'You talk as if a god had made the Machine,' cried the other. 

'I believe that you pray to it when you are unhappy. Men made it, do not forget that. Great men, but men. The Machine is much, but it is not everything. I see something like you in this plate, but I do not see you. I hear something like you through this telephone, but I do not hear you. That is why I want you to come. Pay me a visit, so that we can meet face to face, and talk about the hopes that are in my mind.' 

She replied that she could scarcely spare the time for a visit. 

'The air-ship barely takes two days to fly between me and you.' 

'I dislike air-ships.' 

'Why?' 

'I dislike seeing the horrible brown earth, and the sea, and the stars when it is dark. I get no ideas in an air- ship.' 

'I do not get them anywhere else.' 

'What kind of ideas can the air give you?' He paused for an instant. 

'Do you not know four big stars that form an oblong, and three stars close together in the middle of the oblong, and hanging from these stars, three other stars?' 

'No, I do not. I dislike the stars. But did they give you an idea? How interesting; tell me.' 

'I had an idea that they were like a man.' 

'I do not understand.' 

'The four big stars are the man's shoulders and his knees. 

The three stars in the middle are like the belts that men wore once, and the three stars hanging are like a sword.' 

'A sword?' 

'Men carried swords about with them, to kill animals and other men.' 

'It does not strike me as a very good idea, but it is certainly original. When did it come to you first?' 

'In the air-ship-----' He broke off, and she fancied that he looked sad. She could not be sure, for the Machine did not transmit nuances of expression. It only gave a general idea of people - an idea that was good enough for all practical purposes, Vashti thought. The imponderable bloom, declared by a discredited philosophy to be the actual essence of intercourse, was rightly ignored by the Machine, just as the imponderable bloom of the grape was ignored by the manufacturers of artificial fruit. Something 'good enough' had long since been accepted by our race. 

'The truth is,' he continued, 'that I want to see these stars again. They are curious stars. I want to see them not from the air-ship, but from the surface of the earth, as our ancestors did, thousands of years ago. I want to visit the surface of the earth.' 

She was shocked again. 

'Mother, you must come, if only to explain to me what is the harm of visiting the surface of the earth.' 

'No harm,' she replied, controlling herself. 'But no advantage. The surface of the earth is only dust and mud, no advantage. The surface of the earth is only dust and mud, no life remains on it, and you would need a respirator, or the cold of the outer air would kill you. One dies immediately in the outer air.' 

'I know; of course I shall take all precautions.' 

'And besides----' 

'Well?' 

She considered, and chose her words with care. Her son had a queer temper, and she wished to dissuade him from the expedition. 

'It is contrary to the spirit of the age,' she asserted. 

'Do you mean by that, contrary to the Machine?' 

'In a sense, but----' 

His image is the blue plate faded. 

'Kuno!' 

He had isolated himself. 

For a moment Vashti felt lonely. 

Then she generated the light, and the sight of her room, flooded with radiance and studded with electric buttons, revived her. There were buttons and switches everywhere - buttons to call for food for music, for clothing. There was the hot-bath button, by pressure of which a basin of (imitation) marble rose out of the floor, filled to the brim with a warm deodorized liquid. There was the cold-bath button. There was the button that produced literature. And there were of course the buttons by which she communicated with her friends. The room, though it contained nothing, was in touch with all that she cared for in the world. 

Vashti's next move was to turn off the isolation switch, and all the accumulations of the last three minutes burst upon her. The room was filled with the noise of bells, and speaking-tubes. What was the new food like? Could she recommend it? Has she had any ideas lately? Might one tell her one's own ideas? Would she make an engagement to visit the public nurseries at an early date? - say this day month. 

To most of these questions she replied with irritation - a growing quality in that accelerated age. She said that the new food was horrible. That she could not visit the public nurseries through press of engagements. That she had no ideas of her own but had just been told one-that four stars and three in the middle were like a man: she doubted there was much in it. Then she switched off her correspondents, for it was time to deliver her lecture on Australian music. 

The clumsy system of public gatherings had been long since abandoned; neither Vashti nor her audience stirred from their rooms. Seated in her armchair she spoke, while they in their armchairs heard her, fairly well, and saw her, fairly well. She opened with a humorous account of music in the pre Mongolian epoch, and went on to describe the great outburst of song that followed the Chinese conquest. Remote and primval as were the methods of I-San-So and the Brisbane school, she yet felt (she said) that study of them might repay the musicians of today: they had freshness; they had, above all, ideas. Her lecture, which lasted ten minutes, was well received, and at its conclusion she and many of her audience listened to a lecture on the sea; there were ideas to be got from the sea; the speaker had donned a respirator and visited it lately. Then she fed, talked to many friends, had a bath, talked again, and summoned her bed. 

The bed was not to her liking. It was too large, and she had a feeling for a small bed. Complaint was useless, for beds were of the same dimension all over the world, and to have had an alternative size would have involved vast alterations in the Machine. Vashti isolated herself-it was necessary, for neither day nor night existed under the ground-and reviewed all that had happened since she had summoned the bed last. Ideas? Scarcely any. Events - was Kuno's invitation an event? 

By her side, on the little reading-desk, was a survival from the ages of litter - one book. This was the Book of the Machine. In it were instructions against every possible contingency. If she was hot or cold or dyspeptic or at a loss for a word, she went to the book, and it told her which button to press. The Central Committee published it. In accordance with a growing habit, it was richly bound. 

Sitting up in the bed, she took it reverently in her hands. She glanced round the glowing room as if some one might be watching her. Then, half ashamed, half joyful, she murmured 'O Machine! O Machine!' and raised the volume to her lips. Thrice she kissed it, thrice inclined her head, thrice she felt the delirium of acquiescence. Her ritual performed, she turned to page 1367, which gave the times of the departure of the air-ships from the island in the southern hemisphere, under whose soil she lived, to the island in the northern hemisphere, whereunder lived her son. 

She thought, 'I have not the time.' 

She made the room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light; she ate and exchanged ideas with her friends, and listened to music and attended lectures; she make the room dark and slept. Above her, beneath her, and around her, the Machine hummed eternally; she did not notice the noise, for she had been born with it in her ears. The earth, carrying her, hummed as it sped through silence, turning her now to the invisible sun, now to the invisible stars. She awoke and made the room light. 

'Kuno!' 

'I will not talk to you.' he answered, 'until you come.' 

'Have you been on the surface of the earth since we spoke last?' 

His image faded. 

Again she consulted the book. She became very nervous and lay back in her chair palpitating. Think of her as without teeth or hair. Presently she directed the chair to the wall, and pressed an unfamiliar button. The wall swung apart slowly. Through the opening she saw a tunnel that curved slightly, so that its goal was not visible. Should she go to see her son, here was the beginning of the journey. 

Of course she knew all about the communication-system. There was nothing mysterious in it. She would summon a car and it would fly with her down the tunnel until it reached the lift that communicated with the air-ship station: the system had been in use for many, many years, long before the universal establishment of the Machine. And of course she had studied the civilization that had immediately preceded her own - the civilization that had mistaken the functions of the system, and had used it for bringing people to things, instead of for bringing things to people. Those funny old days, when men went for change of air instead of changing the air in their rooms! And yet-she was frightened of the tunnel: she had not seen it since her last child was born. It curved-but not quite as she remembered; it was brilliant-but not quite as brilliant as a lecturer had suggested. Vashti was seized with the terrors of direct experience. She shrank back into the room, and the wall closed up again. 

'Kuno,' she said, 'I cannot come to see you. I am not well.' 

Immediately an enormous apparatus fell on to her out of the ceiling, a thermometer was automatically laid upon her heart. She lay powerless. Cool pads soothed her forehead. Kuno had telegraphed to her doctor. 

So the human passions still blundered up and down in the Machine. Vashti drank the medicine that the doctor projected into her mouth, and the machinery retired into the ceiling. The voice of Kuno was heard asking how she felt. 

'Better.' Then with irritation: 'But why do you not come to me instead?' 

'Because I cannot leave this place.' 

'Why?' 

'Because, any moment, something tremendous many happen.' 

'Have you been on the surface of the earth yet?' 

'Not yet.' 

'Then what is it?' 

'I will not tell you through the Machine.' 

She resumed her life. 

But she thought of Kuno as a baby, his birth, his removal to the public nurseries, her own visit to him there, his visits to her-visits which stopped when the Machine had assigned him a room on the other side of the earth. 'Parents, duties of,' said the book of the Machine,' cease at the moment of birth. P.422327483.' True, but there was something special about Kuno - indeed there had been something special about all her children - and, after all, she must brave the journey if he desired it. And 'something tremendous might happen'. What did that mean? The nonsense of a youthful man, no doubt, but she must go. Again she pressed the unfamiliar button, again the wall swung back, and she saw the tunnel that curves out of sight. Clasping the Book, she rose, tottered on to the platform, and summoned the car. Her room closed behind her: the journey to the northern hemisphere had begun. 

Of course it was perfectly easy. The car approached and in it she found armchairs exactly like her own. When she signalled, it stopped, and she tottered into the lift. One other passenger was in the lift, the first fellow creature she had seen face to face for months. Few travelled in these days, for, thanks to the advance of science, the earth was exactly alike all over. Rapid intercourse, from which the previous civilization had hoped so much, had ended by defeating itself. What was the good of going to Peking when it was just like Shrewsbury? Why return to Shrewsbury when it would all be like Peking? Men seldom moved their bodies; all unrest was concentrated in the soul. 

The air-ship service was a relic from the former age. It was kept up, because it was easier to keep it up than to stop it or to diminish it, but it now far exceeded the wants of the population. Vessel after vessel would rise from the vomitories of Rye or of Christchurch (I use the antique names), would sail into the crowded sky, and would draw up at the wharves of the south - empty. So nicely adjusted was the system, so independent of meteorology, that the sky, whether calm or cloudy, resembled a vast kaleidoscope whereon the same patterns periodically recurred. The ship on which Vashti sailed started now at sunset, now at dawn. But always, as it passed above Rheas, it would neighbour the ship that served between Helsingfors and the Brazils, and, every third time it surmounted the Alps, the fleet of Palermo would cross its track behind. Night and day, wind and storm, tide and earthquake, impeded man no longer. He had harnessed Leviathan. All the old literature, with its praise of Nature, and its fear of Nature, rang false as the prattle of a child. 

Yet as Vashti saw the vast flank of the ship, stained with exposure to the outer air, her horror of direct experience returned. It was not quite like the air-ship in the cinematophote. For one thing it smelt - not strongly or unpleasantly, but it did smell, and with her eyes shut she should have known that a new thing was close to her. Then she had to walk to it from the lift, had to submit to glances from the other passengers. The man in front dropped his Book - no great matter, but it disquieted them all. In the rooms, if the Book was dropped, the floor raised it mechanically, but the gangway to the air-ship was not so prepared, and the sacred volume lay motionless. They stopped - the thing was unforeseen - and the man, instead of picking up his property, felt the muscles of his arm to see how they had failed him. Then some one actually said with direct utterance: 'We shall be late' - and they trooped on board, Vashti treading on the pages as she did so. 

Inside, her anxiety increased. The arrangements were old- fashioned and rough. There was even a female attendant, to whom she would have to announce her wants during the voyage. Of course a revolving platform ran the length of the boat, but she was expected to walk from it to her cabin. Some cabins were better than others, and she did not get the best. She thought the attendant had been unfair, and spasms of rage shook her. The glass valves had closed, she could not go back. She saw, at the end of the vestibule, the lift in which she had ascended going quietly up and down, empty. Beneath those corridors of shining tiles were rooms, tier below tier, reaching far into the earth, and in each room there sat a human being, eating, or sleeping, or producing ideas. And buried deep in the hive was her own room. Vashti was afraid. 

'O Machine!' she murmured, and caressed her Book, and was comforted. 

Then the sides of the vestibule seemed to melt together, as do the passages that we see in dreams, the lift vanished, the Book that had been dropped slid to the left and vanished, polished tiles rushed by like a stream of water, there was a slight jar, and the air-ship, issuing from its tunnel, soared above the waters of a tropical ocean. 

It was night. For a moment she saw the coast of Sumatra edged by the phosphorescence of waves, and crowned by lighthouses, still sending forth their disregarded beams. These also vanished, and only the stars distracted her. They were not motionless, but swayed to and fro above her head, thronging out of one sky-light into another, as if the universe and not the air-ship was careening. And, as often happens on clear nights, they seemed now to be in perspective, now on a plane; now piled tier beyond tier into the infinite heavens, now concealing infinity, a roof limiting for ever the visions of men. In either case they seemed intolerable. 'Are we to travel in the dark?' called the passengers angrily, and the attendant, who had been careless, generated the light, and pulled down the blinds of pliable metal. When the air-ships had been built, the desire to look direct at things still lingered in the world. Hence the extraordinary number of skylights and windows, and the proportionate discomfort to those who were civilized and refined. Even in Vashti's cabin one star peeped through a flaw in the blind, and after a few hers' uneasy slumber, she was disturbed by an unfamiliar glow, which was the dawn. 

Quick as the ship had sped westwards, the earth had rolled eastwards quicker still, and had dragged back Vashti and her companions towards the sun. Science could prolong the night, but only for a little, and those high hopes of neutralizing the earth's diurnal revolution had passed, together with hopes that were possibly higher. To 'keep pace with the sun,' or even to outstrip it, had been the aim of the civilization preceding this. Racing aeroplanes had been built for the purpose, capable of enormous speed, and steered by the greatest intellects of the epoch. Round the globe they went, round and round, westward, westward, round and round, amidst humanity's applause. In vain. The globe went eastward quicker still, horrible accidents occurred, and the Committee of the Machine, at the time rising into prominence, declared the pursuit illegal, unmechanical, and punishable by Homelessness. 

Of Homelessness more will be said later. 

Doubtless the Committee was right. Yet the attempt to 'defeat the sun' aroused the last common interest that our race experienced about the heavenly bodies, or indeed about anything. It was the last time that men were compacted by thinking of a power outside the world. The sun had conquered, yet it was the end of his spiritual dominion. Dawn, midday, twilight, the zodiacal path, touched neither men's lives not their hearts, and science retreated into the ground, to concentrate herself upon problems that she was certain of solving. 

So when Vashti found her cabin invaded by a rosy finger of light, she was annoyed, and tried to adjust the blind. But the blind flew up altogether, and she saw through the skylight small pink clouds, swaying against a background of blue, and as the sun crept higher, its radiance entered direct, brimming down the wall, like a golden sea. It rose and fell with the air-ship's motion, just as waves rise and fall, but it advanced steadily, as a tide advances. Unless she was careful, it would strike her face. A spasm of horror shook her and she rang for the attendant. The attendant too was horrified, but she could do nothing; it was not her place to mend the blind. She could only suggest that the lady should change her cabin, which she accordingly prepared to do. 

People were almost exactly alike all over the world, but the attendant of the air-ship, perhaps owing to her exceptional duties, had grown a little out of the common. She had often to address passengers with direct speech, and this had given her a certain roughness and originality of manner. When Vashti swerved away from the sunbeams with a cry, she behaved barbarically - she put out her hand to steady her. 

'How dare you!' exclaimed the passenger. 'You forget yourself!' 

The woman was confused, and apologized for not having let her fall. People never touched one another. The custom had become obsolete, owing to the Machine. 

'Where are we now?' asked Vashti haughtily. 

'We are over Asia,' said the attendant, anxious to be polite. 

'Asia?' 

'You must excuse my common way of speaking. I have got into the habit of calling places over which I pass by their unmechanical names.' 

'Oh, I remember Asia. The Mongols came from it.' 

'Beneath us, in the open air, stood a city that was once called Simla.' 'Have you ever heard of the Mongols and of the Brisbane school?' 

'No.' 

'Brisbane also stood in the open air.' 

'Those mountains to the right - let me show you them.' She pushed back a metal blind. The main chain of the Himalayas was revealed. 'They were once called the Roof of the World, those mountains.' 

'You must remember that, before the dawn of civilization, they seemed to be an impenetrable wall that touched the stars. It was supposed that no one but the gods could exist above their summits. How we have advanced, thanks to the Machine!' 

'How we have advanced, thanks to the Machine!' said Vashti. 

'How we have advanced, thanks to the Machine!' echoed the passenger who had dropped his Book the night before, and who was standing in the passage. 

'And that white stuff in the cracks? - what is it?' 

'I have forgotten its name.' 

'Cover the window, please. These mountains give me no ideas.' 

The northern aspect of the Himalayas was in deep shadow: on the Indian slope the sun had just prevailed. The forests had been destroyed during the literature epoch for the purpose of making newspaper-pulp, but the snows were awakening to their morning glory, and clouds still hung on the breasts of Kinchinjunga. In the plain were seen the ruins of cities, with diminished rivers creeping by their walls, and by the sides of these were sometimes the signs of vomitories, marking the cities of to day. Over the whole prospect air-ships rushed, crossing the inter-crossing with incredible aplomb, and rising nonchalantly when they desired to escape the perturbations of the lower atmosphere and to traverse the Roof of the World. 

'We have indeed advance, thanks to the Machine,' repeated the attendant, and hid the Himalayas behind a metal blind. 

The day dragged wearily forward. The passengers sat each in his cabin, avoiding one another with an almost physical repulsion and longing to be once more under the surface of the earth. There were eight or ten of them, mostly young males, sent out from the public nurseries to inhabit the rooms of those who had died in various parts of the earth. The man who had dropped his Book was on the homeward journey. He had been sent to Sumatra for the purpose of propagating the race. Vashti alone was travelling by her private will. 

At midday she took a second glance at the earth. The air-ship was crossing another range of mountains, but she could see little, owing to clouds. Masses of black rock hovered below her, and merged indistinctly into grey. Their shapes were fantastic; one of them resembled a prostrate man. 

'No ideas here,' murmured Vashti, and hid the Caucasus behind a metal blind. 

In the evening she looked again. They were crossing a golden sea, in which lay many small islands and one peninsula. She repeated, 'No ideas here,' and hid Greece behind a metal blind. 


<strong>
Part II
The Mending Apparatus</strong>
By a vestibule, by a lift, by a tubular railway, by a platform, by a sliding door - by reversing all the steps of her departure did Vashti arrive at her son's room, which exactly resembled her own. She might well declare that the visit was superfluous. The buttons, the knobs, the reading-desk with the Book, the temperature, the atmosphere, the illumination - all were exactly the same. And if Kuno himself, flesh of her flesh, stood close beside her at last, what profit was there in that? She was too well-bred to shake him by the hand. 

Averting her eyes, she spoke as follows: 

'Here I am. I have had the most terrible journey and greatly retarded the development of my soul. It is not worth it, Kuno, it is not worth it. My time is too precious. The sunlight almost touched me, and I have met with the rudest people. I can only stop a few minutes. Say what you want to say, and then I must return.' 

'I have been threatened with Homelessness,' said Kuno. 

She looked at him now. 

'I have been threatened with Homelessness, and I could not tell you such a thing through the Machine.' 

Homelessness means death. The victim is exposed to the air, which kills him. 

'I have been outside since I spoke to you last. The tremendous thing has happened, and they have discovered me.' 

'But why shouldn't you go outside?' she exclaimed, 'It is perfectly legal, perfectly mechanical, to visit the surface of the earth. I have lately been to a lecture on the sea; there is no objection to that; one simply summons a respirator and gets an Egression-permit. It is not the kind of thing that spiritually minded people do, and I begged you not to do it, but there is no legal objection to it.' 

'I did not get an Egression-permit.' 

'Then how did you get out?' 

'I found out a way of my own.' 

The phrase conveyed no meaning to her, and he had to repeat it. 

'A way of your own?' she whispered. 'But that would be wrong.' 

'Why?' 

The question shocked her beyond measure. 

'You are beginning to worship the Machine,' he said coldly. 

'You think it irreligious of me to have found out a way of my own. It was just what the Committee thought, when they threatened me with Homelessness.' 

At this she grew angry. 'I worship nothing!' she cried. 'I am most advanced. I don't think you irreligious, for there is no such thing as religion left. All the fear and the superstition that existed once have been destroyed by the Machine. I only meant that to find out a way of your own was----Besides, there is no new way out.' 

'So it is always supposed.' 

'Except through the vomitories, for which one must have an Egression-permit, it is impossible to get out. The Book says so.' 

'Well, the Book's wrong, for I have been out on my feet.' 

For Kuno was possessed of a certain physical strength. 

By these days it was a demerit to be muscular. Each infant was examined at birth, and all who promised undue strength were destroyed. Humanitarians may protest, but it would have been no true kindness to let an athlete live; he would never have been happy in that state of life to which the Machine had called him; he would have yearned for trees to climb, rivers to bathe in, meadows and hills against which he might measure his body. Man must be adapted to his surroundings, must he not? In the dawn of the world our weakly must be exposed on Mount Taygetus, in its twilight our strong will suffer euthanasia, that the Machine may progress, that the Machine may progress, that the Machine may progress eternally. 

'You know that we have lost the sense of space. We say 'space is annihilated', but we have annihilated not space, but the sense thereof. We have lost a part of ourselves. I determined to recover it, and I began by walking up and down the platform of the railway outside my room. Up and down, until I was tired, and so did recapture the meaning of ""Near"" and ""Far"". ""Near"" is a place to which I can get quickly on my feet, not a place to which the train or the air-ship will take me quickly. 'Far' is a place to which I cannot get quickly on my feet; the vomitory is 'far', though I could be there in thirty-eight seconds by summoning the train. Man is the measure. That was my first lesson. Man's feet are the measure for distance, his hands are the measure for ownership, his body is the measure for all that is lovable and desirable and strong. Then I went further: it was then that I called to you for the first time, and you would not come. 

'This city, as you know, is built deep beneath the surface of the earth, with only the vomitories protruding. Having paced the platform outside my own room, I took the lift to the next platform and paced that also, and so with each in turn, until I came to the topmost, above which begins the earth. All the platforms were exactly alike, and all that I gained by visiting them was to develop my sense of space and my muscles. I think I should have been content with this - it is not a little thing, - but as I walked and brooded, it occurred to me that our cities had been built in the days when men still breathed the outer air, and that there had been ventilation shafts for the workmen. I could think of nothing but these ventilation shafts. Had they been destroyed by all the food-tubes and medicine-tubes and music-tubes that the Machine has evolved lately? Or did traces of them remain? One thing was certain. If I came upon them anywhere, it would be in the railway-tunnels of the topmost storey. Everywhere else, all space was accounted for. 

'I am telling my story quickly, but don't think that I was not a coward or that your answers never depressed me. It is not the proper thing, it is not mechanical, it is not decent to walk along a railway-tunnel. I did not fear that I might tread upon a live rail and be killed. I feared something far more intangible - doing what was not contemplated by the Machine. Then I said to myself, ""Man is the measure"", and I went, and after many visits I found an opening. 

'The tunnels, of course, were lighted. Everything is light, artificial light; darkness is the exception. So when I saw a black gap in the tiles, I knew that it was an exception, and rejoiced. I put in my arm - I could put in no more at first - and waved it round and round in ecstasy. I loosened another tile, and put in my head, and shouted into the darkness: ""I am coming, I shall do it yet,"" and my voice reverberated down endless passages. I seemed to hear the spirits of those dead workmen who had returned each evening to the starlight and to their wives, and all the generations who had lived in the open air called back to me, ""You will do it yet, you are coming,""' 

He paused, and, absurd as he was, his last words moved her. 

For Kuno had lately asked to be a father, and his request had been refused by the Committee. His was not a type that the Machine desired to hand on. 

'Then a train passed. It brushed by me, but I thrust my head and arms into the hole. I had done enough for one day, so I crawled back to the platform, went down in the lift, and summoned my bed. Ah what dreams! And again I called you, and again you refused.' 

She shook her head and said: 

'Don't. Don't talk of these terrible things. You make me miserable. You are throwing civilization away.' 

'But I had got back the sense of space and a man cannot rest then. I determined to get in at the hole and climb the shaft. And so I exercised my arms. Day after day I went through ridiculous movements, until my flesh ached, and I could hang by my hands and hold the pillow of my bed outstretched for many minutes. Then I summoned a respirator, and started. 

'It was easy at first. The mortar had somehow rotted, and I soon pushed some more tiles in, and clambered after them into the darkness, and the spirits of the dead comforted me. I don't know what I mean by that. I just say what I felt. I felt, for the first time, that a protest had been lodged against corruption, and that even as the dead were comforting me, so I was comforting the unborn. I felt that humanity existed, and that it existed without clothes. How can I possibly explain this? It was naked, humanity seemed naked, and all these tubes and buttons and machineries neither came into the world with us, nor will they follow us out, nor do they matter supremely while we are here. Had I been strong, I would have torn off every garment I had, and gone out into the outer air unswaddled. But this is not for me, nor perhaps for my generation. I climbed with my respirator and my hygienic clothes and my dietetic tabloids! Better thus than not at all. 

'There was a ladder, made of some primval metal. The light from the railway fell upon its lowest rungs, and I saw that it led straight upwards out of the rubble at the bottom of the shaft. Perhaps our ancestors ran up and down it a dozen times daily, in their building. As I climbed, the rough edges cut through my gloves so that my hands bled. The light helped me for a little, and then came darkness and, worse still, silence which pierced my ears like a sword. The Machine hums! Did you know that? Its hum penetrates our blood, and may even guide our thoughts. Who knows! I was getting beyond its power. Then I thought: 'This silence means that I am doing wrong.' But I heard voices in the silence, and again they strengthened me.' He laughed. 'I had need of them. The next moment I cracked my head against something.' 

She sighed. 

'I had reached one of those pneumatic stoppers that defend us from the outer air. You may have noticed them no the air-ship. Pitch dark, my feet on the rungs of an invisible ladder, my hands cut; I cannot explain how I lived through this part, but the voices still comforted me, and I felt for fastenings. The stopper, I suppose, was about eight feet across. I passed my hand over it as far as I could reach. It was perfectly smooth. I felt it almost to the centre. Not quite to the centre, for my arm was too short. Then the voice said: ""Jump. It is worth it. There may be a handle in the centre, and you may catch hold of it and so come to us your own way. And if there is no handle, so that you may fall and are dashed to pieces - it is till worth it: you will still come to us your own way."" So I jumped. There was a handle, and ----' 

He paused. Tears gathered in his mother's eyes. She knew that he was fated. If he did not die today he would die tomorrow. There was not room for such a person in the world. And with her pity disgust mingled. She was ashamed at having borne such a son, she who had always been so respectable and so full of ideas. Was he really the little boy to whom she had taught the use of his stops and buttons, and to whom she had given his first lessons in the Book? The very hair that disfigured his lip showed that he was reverting to some savage type. On atavism the Machine can have no mercy. 

'There was a handle, and I did catch it. I hung tranced over the darkness and heard the hum of these workings as the last whisper in a dying dream. All the things I had cared about and all the people I had spoken to through tubes appeared infinitely little. Meanwhile the handle revolved. My weight had set something in motion and I span slowly, and then---- 

'I cannot describe it. I was lying with my face to the sunshine. Blood poured from my nose and ears and I heard a tremendous roaring. The stopper, with me clinging to it, had simply been blown out of the earth, and the air that we make down here was escaping through the vent into the air above. It burst up like a fountain. I crawled back to it - for the upper air hurts - and, as it were, I took great sips from the edge. My respirator had flown goodness knows here, my clothes were torn. I just lay with my lips close to the hole, and I sipped until the bleeding stopped. You can imagine nothing so curious. This hollow in the grass - I will speak of it in a minute, - the sun shining into it, not brilliantly but through marbled clouds, - the peace, the nonchalance, the sense of space, and, brushing my cheek, the roaring fountain of our artificial air! Soon I spied my respirator, bobbing up and down in the current high above my head, and higher still were many air-ships. But no one ever looks out of air-ships, and in any case they could not have picked me up. There I was, stranded. The sun shone a little way down the shaft, and revealed the topmost rung of the ladder, but it was hopeless trying to reach it. I should either have been tossed up again by the escape, or else have fallen in, and died. I could only lie on the grass, sipping and sipping, and from time to time glancing around me. 

'I knew that I was in Wessex, for I had taken care to go to a lecture on the subject before starting. Wessex lies above the room in which we are talking now. It was once an important state. Its kings held all the southern coast from the Andredswald to Cornwall, while the Wansdyke protected them on the north, running over the high ground. The lecturer was only concerned with the rise of Wessex, so I do not know how long it remained an international power, nor would the knowledge have assisted me. To tell the truth I could do nothing but laugh, during this part. There was I, with a pneumatic stopper by my side and a respirator bobbing over my head, imprisoned, all three of us, in a grass-grown hollow that was edged with fern.' 

Then he grew grave again. 

'Lucky for me that it was a hollow. For the air began to fall back into it and to fill it as water fills a bowl. I could crawl about. Presently I stood. I breathed a mixture, in which the air that hurts predominated whenever I tried to climb the sides. This was not so bad. I had not lost my tabloids and remained ridiculously cheerful, and as for the Machine, I forgot about it altogether. My one aim now was to get to the top, where the ferns were, and to view whatever objects lay beyond. 

'I rushed the slope. The new air was still too bitter for me and I came rolling back, after a momentary vision of something grey. The sun grew very feeble, and I remembered that he was in Scorpio - I had been to a lecture on that too. If the sun is in Scorpio, and you are in Wessex, it means that you must be as quick as you can, or it will get too dark. (This is the first bit of useful information I have ever got from a lecture, and I expect it will be the last.) It made me try frantically to breathe the new air, and to advance as far as I dared out of my pond. The hollow filled so slowly. At times I thought that the fountain played with less vigour. My respirator seemed to dance nearer the earth; the roar was decreasing.' 

He broke off. 

'I don't think this is interesting you. The rest will interest you even less. There are no ideas in it, and I wish that I had not troubled you to come. We are too different, mother.' 

She told him to continue. 

'It was evening before I climbed the bank. The sun had very nearly slipped out of the sky by this time, and I could not get a good view. You, who have just crossed the Roof of the World, will not want to hear an account of the little hills that I saw - low colourless hills. But to me they were living and the turf that covered them was a skin, under which their muscles rippled, and I felt that those hills had called with incalculable force to men in the past, and that men had loved them. Now they sleep - perhaps for ever. They commune with humanity in dreams. Happy the man, happy the woman, who awakes the hills of Wessex. For though they sleep, they will never die.' 

His voice rose passionately. 

'Cannot you see, cannot all you lecturers see, that it is we that are dying, and that down here the only thing that really lives is the Machine? We created the Machine, to do our will, but we cannot make it do our will now. It has robbed us of the sense of space and of the sense of touch, it has blurred every human relation and narrowed down love to a carnal act, it has paralysed our bodies and our wills, and now it compels us to worship it. The Machine develops - but not on our lies. The Machine proceeds - but not to our goal. We only exist as the blood corpuscles that course through its arteries, and if it could work without us, it would let us die. Oh, I have no remedy - or, at least, only one - to tell men again and again that I have seen the hills of Wessex as Aelfrid saw them when he overthrew the Danes. 

'So the sun set. I forgot to mention that a belt of mist lay between my hill and other hills, and that it was the colour of pearl.' 

He broke off for the second time. 

'Go on,' said his mother wearily. 

He shook his head. 

'Go on. Nothing that you say can distress me now. I am hardened.' 

'I had meant to tell you the rest, but I cannot: I know that I cannot: good-bye.' 

Vashti stood irresolute. All her nerves were tingling with his blasphemies. But she was also inquisitive. 

'This is unfair,' she complained. 'You have called me across the world to hear your story, and hear it I will. Tell me - as briefly as possible, for this is a disastrous waste of time - tell me how you returned to civilization.' 

'Oh - that!' he said, starting. 'You would like to hear about civilization. Certainly. Had I got to where my respirator fell down?' 

'No - but I understand everything now. You put on your respirator, and managed to walk along the surface of the earth to a vomitory, and there your conduct was reported to the Central Committee.' 

'By no means.' 

He passed his hand over his forehead, as if dispelling some strong impression. Then, resuming his narrative, he warmed to it again. 

'My respirator fell about sunset. I had mentioned that the fountain seemed feebler, had I not?' 

'Yes.' 

'About sunset, it let the respirator fall. As I said, I had entirely forgotten about the Machine, and I paid no great attention at the time, being occupied with other things. I had my pool of air, into which I could dip when the outer keenness became intolerable, and which would possibly remain for days, provided that no wind sprang up to disperse it. Not until it was too late did I realize what the stoppage of the escape implied. You see - the gap in the tunnel had been mended; the Mending Apparatus; the Mending Apparatus, was after me. 

'One other warning I had, but I neglected it. The sky at night was clearer than it had been in the day, and the moon, which was about half the sky behind the sun, shone into the dell at moments quite brightly. I was in my usual place - on the boundary between the two atmospheres - when I thought I saw something dark move across the bottom of the dell, and vanish into the shaft. In my folly, I ran down. I bent over and listened, and I thought I heard a faint scraping noise in the depths. 

'At this - but it was too late - I took alarm. I determined to put on my respirator and to walk right out of the dell. But my respirator had gone. I knew exactly where it had fallen - between the stopper and the aperture - and I could even feel the mark that it had made in the turf. It had gone, and I realized that something evil was at work, and I had better escape to the other air, and, if I must die, die running towards the cloud that had been the colour of a pearl. I never started. Out of the shaft - it is too horrible. A worm, a long white worm, had crawled out of the shaft and was gliding over the moonlit grass. 

'I screamed. I did everything that I should not have done, I stamped upon the creature instead of flying from it, and it at once curled round the ankle. Then we fought. The worm let me run all over the dell, but edged up my leg as I ran. 'Help!' I cried. (That part is too awful. It belongs to the part that you will never know.) 'Help!' I cried. (Why cannot we suffer in silence?) 'Help!' I cried. When my feet were wound together, I fell, I was dragged away from the dear ferns and the living hills, and past the great metal stopper (I can tell you this part), and I thought it might save me again if I caught hold of the handle. It also was enwrapped, it also. Oh, the whole dell was full of the things. They were searching it in all directions, they were denuding it, and the white snouts of others peeped out of the hole, ready if needed. Everything that could be moved they brought - brushwood, bundles of fern, everything, and down we all went intertwined into hell. The last things that I saw, ere the stopper closed after us, were certain stars, and I felt that a man of my sort lived in the sky. For I did fight, I fought till the very end, and it was only my head hitting against the ladder that quieted me. I woke up in this room. The worms had vanished. I was surrounded by artificial air, artificial light, artificial peace, and my friends were calling to me down speaking-tubes to know whether I had come across any new ideas lately.' 

Here his story ended. Discussion of it was impossible, and Vashti turned to go. 

'It will end in Homelessness,' she said quietly. 

'I wish it would,' retorted Kuno. 

'The Machine has been most merciful.' 

'I prefer the mercy of God.' 

'By that superstitious phrase, do you mean that you could live in the outer air?' 

'Yes.' 

'Have you ever seen, round the vomitories, the bones of those who were extruded after the Great Rebellion?' 

'Yes.' 

'They were left where they perished for our edification. A few crawled away, but they perished, too - who can doubt it? And so with the Homeless of our own day. The surface of the earth supports life no longer.' 

'Indeed.' 

'Ferns and a little grass may survive, but all higher forms have perished. Has any air-ship detected them?' 

'No.' 

'Has any lecturer dealt with them?' 

'No.' 

'Then why this obstinacy?' 

'Because I have seen them,' he exploded. 

'Seen what?' 

'Because I have seen her in the twilight - because she came to my help when I called - because she, too, was entangled by the worms, and, luckier than I, was killed by one of them piercing her throat.' 

He was mad. Vashti departed, nor, in the troubles that followed, did she ever see his face again. 



<strong>Part III
The Homeless</strong>
During the years that followed Kuno's escapade, two important developments took place in the Machine. On the surface they were revolutionary, but in either case men's minds had been prepared beforehand, and they did but express tendencies that were latent already. 

The first of these was the abolition of respirators. 

Advanced thinkers, like Vashti, had always held it foolish to visit the surface of the earth. Air-ships might be necessary, but what was the good of going out for mere curiosity and crawling along for a mile or two in a terrestrial motor? The habit was vulgar and perhaps faintly improper: it was unproductive of ideas, and had no connection with the habits that really mattered. So respirators were abolished, and with them, of course, the terrestrial motors, and except for a few lecturers, who complained that they were debarred access to their subject- matter, the development was accepted quietly. Those who still wanted to know what the earth was like had after all only to listen to some gramophone, or to look into some cinematophote. And even the lecturers acquiesced when they found that a lecture on the sea was none the less stimulating when compiled out of other lectures that had already been delivered on the same subject. 'Beware of first- hand ideas!' exclaimed one of the most advanced of them. 'First-hand ideas do not really exist. They are but the physical impressions produced by live and fear, and on this gross foundation who could erect a philosophy? Let your ideas be second-hand, and if possible tenth-hand, for then they will be far removed from that disturbing element - direct observation. Do not learn anything about this subject of mine - the French Revolution. Learn instead what I think that Enicharmon thought Urizen thought Gutch thought Ho-Yung thought Chi-Bo-Sing thought Lafcadio Hearn thought Carlyle thought Mirabeau said about the French Revolution. Through the medium of these ten great minds, the blood that was shed at Paris and the windows that were broken at Versailles will be clarified to an idea which you may employ most profitably in your daily lives. But be sure that the intermediates are many and varied, for in history one authority exists to counteract another. Urizen must counteract the scepticism of Ho-Yung and Enicharmon, I must myself counteract the impetuosity of Gutch. You who listen to me are in a better position to judge about the French Revolution than I am. Your descendants will be even in a better position than you, for they will learn what you think I think, and yet another intermediate will be added to the chain. And in time' - his voice rose - 'there will come a generation that had got beyond facts, beyond impressions, a generation absolutely colourless, a generation 

seraphically free
From taint of personality,

which will see the French Revolution not as it happened, nor as they would like it to have happened, but as it would have happened, had it taken place in the days of the Machine.' 

Tremendous applause greeted this lecture, which did but voice a feeling already latent in the minds of men - a feeling that terrestrial facts must be ignored, and that the abolition of respirators was a positive gain. It was even suggested that air-ships should be abolished too. This was not done, because air-ships had somehow worked themselves into the Machine's system. But year by year they were used less, and mentioned less by thoughtful men. 

The second great development was the re-establishment of religion. 

This, too, had been voiced in the celebrated lecture. No one could mistake the reverent tone in which the peroration had concluded, and it awakened a responsive echo in the heart of each. Those who had long worshipped silently, now began to talk. They described the strange feeling of peace that came over them when they handled the Book of the Machine, the pleasure that it was to repeat certain numerals out of it, however little meaning those numerals conveyed to the outward ear, the ecstasy of touching a button, however unimportant, or of ringing an electric bell, however superfluously. 

'The Machine,' they exclaimed, 'feeds us and clothes us and houses us; through it we speak to one another, through it we see one another, in it we have our being. The Machine is the friend of ideas and the enemy of superstition: the Machine is omnipotent, eternal; blessed is the Machine.' And before long this allocution was printed on the first page of the Book, and in subsequent editions the ritual swelled into a complicated system of praise and prayer. The word 'religion' was sedulously avoided, and in theory the Machine was still the creation and the implement of man. But in practice all, save a few retrogrades, worshipped it as divine. Nor was it worshipped in unity. One believer would be chiefly impressed by the blue optic plates, through which he saw other believers; another by the mending apparatus, which sinful Kuno had compared to worms; another by the lifts, another by the Book. And each would pray to this or to that, and ask it to intercede for him with the Machine as a whole. Persecution - that also was present. It did not break out, for reasons that will be set forward shortly. But it was latent, and all who did not accept the minimum known as 'undenominational Mechanism' lived in danger of Homelessness, which means death, as we know. 

To attribute these two great developments to the Central Committee, is to take a very narrow view of civilization. The Central Committee announced the developments, it is true, but they were no more the cause of them than were the kings of the imperialistic period the cause of war. Rather did they yield to some invincible pressure, which came no one knew whither, and which, when gratified, was succeeded by some new pressure equally invincible. To such a state of affairs it is convenient to give the name of progress. No one confessed the Machine was out of hand. Year by year it was served with increased efficiency and decreased intelligence. The better a man knew his own duties upon it, the less he understood the duties of his neighbour, and in all the world there was not one who understood the monster as a whole. Those master brains had perished. They had left full directions, it is true, and their successors had each of them mastered a portion of those directions. But Humanity, in its desire for comfort, had over-reached itself. It had exploited the riches of nature too far. Quietly and complacently, it was sinking into decadence, and progress had come to mean the progress of the Machine. 

As for Vashti, her life went peacefully forward until the final disaster. She made her room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light. She lectured and attended lectures. She exchanged ideas with her innumerable friends and believed she was growing more spiritual. At times a friend was granted Euthanasia, and left his or her room for the homelessness that is beyond all human conception. Vashti did not much mind. After an unsuccessful lecture, she would sometimes ask for Euthanasia herself. But the death-rate was not permitted to exceed the birth-rate, and the Machine had hitherto refused it to her. 

The troubles began quietly, long before she was conscious of them. 

One day she was astonished at receiving a message from her son. They never communicated, having nothing in common, and she had only heard indirectly that he was still alive, and had been transferred from the northern hemisphere, where he had behaved so mischievously, to the southern - indeed, to a room not far from her own. 

'Does he want me to visit him?' she thought. 'Never again, never. And I have not the time.' 

No, it was madness of another kind. 

He refused to visualize his face upon the blue plate, and speaking out of the darkness with solemnity said: 

'The Machine stops.' 

'What do you say?' 

'The Machine is stopping, I know it, I know the signs.' 

She burst into a peal of laughter. He heard her and was angry, and they spoke no more. 

'Can you imagine anything more absurd?' she cried to a friend. 'A man who was my son believes that the Machine is stopping. It would be impious if it was not mad.' 

'The Machine is stopping?' her friend replied. 'What does that mean? The phrase conveys nothing to me.' 

'Nor to me.' 

'He does not refer, I suppose, to the trouble there has been lately with the music?' 

'Oh no, of course not. Let us talk about music.' 

'Have you complained to the authorities?' 

'Yes, and they say it wants mending, and referred me to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus. I complained of those curious gasping sighs that disfigure the symphonies of the Brisbane school. They sound like some one in pain. The Committee of the Mending Apparatus say that it shall be remedied shortly.' 

Obscurely worried, she resumed her life. For one thing, the defect in the music irritated her. For another thing, she could not forget Kuno's speech. If he had known that the music was out of repair - he could not know it, for he detested music - if he had known that it was wrong, 'the Machine stops' was exactly the venomous sort of remark he would have made. Of course he had made it at a venture, but the coincidence annoyed her, and she spoke with some petulance to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus. 

They replied, as before, that the defect would be set right shortly. 

'Shortly! At once!' she retorted. 'Why should I be worried by imperfect music? Things are always put right at once. If you do not mend it at once, I shall complain to the Central Committee.' 

'No personal complaints are received by the Central Committee,' the Committee of the Mending Apparatus replied. 

'Through whom am I to make my complaint, then?' 

'Through us.' 

'I complain then.' 

'Your complaint shall be forwarded in its turn.' 

'Have others complained?' 

This question was unmechanical, and the Committee of the Mending Apparatus refused to answer it. 

'It is too bad!' she exclaimed to another of her friends. 

'There never was such an unfortunate woman as myself. I can never be sure of my music now. It gets worse and worse each time I summon it.' 

'What is it?' 

'I do not know whether it is inside my head, or inside the wall.' 

'Complain, in either case.' 

'I have complained, and my complaint will be forwarded in its turn to the Central Committee.' 

Time passed, and they resented the defects no longer. The defects had not been remedied, but the human tissues in that latter day had become so subservient, that they readily adapted themselves to every caprice of the Machine. The sigh at the crises of the Brisbane symphony no longer irritated Vashti; she accepted it as part of the melody. The jarring noise, whether in the head or in the wall, was no longer resented by her friend. And so with the mouldy artificial fruit, so with the bath water that began to stink, so with the defective rhymes that the poetry machine had taken to emit. All were bitterly complained of at first, and then acquiesced in and forgotten. Things went from bad to worse unchallenged. 

It was otherwise with the failure of the sleeping apparatus. That was a more serious stoppage. There came a day when over the whole world - in Sumatra, in Wessex, in the innumerable cities of Courland and Brazil - the beds, when summoned by their tired owners, failed to appear. It may seem a ludicrous matter, but from it we may date the collapse of humanity. The Committee responsible for the failure was assailed by complainants, whom it referred, as usual, to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus, who in its turn assured them that their complaints would be forwarded to the Central Committee. But the discontent grew, for mankind was not yet sufficiently adaptable to do without sleeping. 

'Some one is meddling with the Machine---' they began. 

'Some one is trying to make himself king, to reintroduce the personal element.' 

'Punish that man with Homelessness.' 

'To the rescue! Avenge the Machine! Avenge the Machine!' 

'War! Kill the man!' 

But the Committee of the Mending Apparatus now came forward, and allayed the panic with well-chosen words. It confessed that the Mending Apparatus was itself in need of repair. 

The effect of this frank confession was admirable. 

'Of course,' said a famous lecturer - he of the French Revolution, who gilded each new decay with splendour - 'of course we shall not press our complaints now. The Mending Apparatus has treated us so well in the past that we all sympathize with it, and will wait patiently for its recovery. In its own good time it will resume its duties. Meanwhile let us do without our beds, our tabloids, our other little wants. Such, I feel sure, would be the wish of the Machine.' 

Thousands of miles away his audience applauded. The Machine still linked them. Under the seas, beneath the roots of the mountains, ran the wires through which they saw and heard, the enormous eyes and ears that were their heritage, and the hum of many workings clothed their thoughts in one garment of subserviency. Only the old and the sick remained ungrateful, for it was rumoured that Euthanasia, too, was out of order, and that pain had reappeared among men. 

It became difficult to read. A blight entered the atmosphere and dulled its luminosity. At times Vashti could scarcely see across her room. The air, too, was foul. Loud were the complaints, impotent the remedies, heroic the tone of the lecturer as he cried: 'Courage! courage! What matter so long as the Machine goes on? To it the darkness and the light are one.' And though things improved again after a time, the old brilliancy was never recaptured, and humanity never recovered from its entrance into twilight. There was an hysterical talk of 'measures,' of 'provisional dictatorship,' and the inhabitants of Sumatra were asked to familiarize themselves with the workings of the central power station, the said power station being situated in France. But for the most part panic reigned, and men spent their strength praying to their Books, tangible proofs of the Machine's omnipotence. There were gradations of terror - at times came rumours of hope-the Mending Apparatus was almost mended - the enemies of the Machine had been got under - new 'nerve-centres' were evolving which would do the work even more magnificently than before. But there came a day when, without the slightest warning, without any previous hint of feebleness, the entire communication-system broke down, all over the world, and the world, as they understood it, ended. 

Vashti was lecturing at the time and her earlier remarks had been punctuated with applause. As she proceeded the audience became silent, and at the conclusion there was no sound. Somewhat displeased, she called to a friend who was a specialist in sympathy. No sound: doubtless the friend was sleeping. And so with the next friend whom she tried to summon, and so with the next, until she remembered Kuno's cryptic remark, 'The Machine stops'. 

The phrase still conveyed nothing. If Eternity was stopping it would of course be set going shortly. 

For example, there was still a little light and air - the atmosphere had improved a few hours previously. There was still the Book, and while there was the Book there was security. 

Then she broke down, for with the cessation of activity came an unexpected terror - silence. 

She had never known silence, and the coming of it nearly killed her - it did kill many thousands of people outright. Ever since her birth she had been surrounded by the steady hum. It was to the ear what artificial air was to the lungs, and agonizing pains shot across her head. And scarcely knowing what she did, she stumbled forward and pressed the unfamiliar button, the one that opened the door of her cell. 

Now the door of the cell worked on a simple hinge of its own. It was not connected with the central power station, dying far away in France. It opened, rousing immoderate hopes in Vashti, for she thought that the Machine had been mended. It opened, and she saw the dim tunnel that curved far away towards freedom. One look, and then she shrank back. For the tunnel was full of people - she was almost the last in that city to have taken alarm. 

People at any time repelled her, and these were nightmares from her worst dreams. People were crawling about, people were screaming, whimpering, gasping for breath, touching each other, vanishing in the dark, and ever and anon being pushed off the platform on to the live rail. Some were fighting round the electric bells, trying to summon trains which could not be summoned. Others were yelling for Euthanasia or for respirators, or blaspheming the Machine. Others stood at the doors of their cells fearing, like herself, either to stop in them or to leave them. And behind all the uproar was silence - the silence which is the voice of the earth and of the generations who have gone. 

No - it was worse than solitude. She closed the door again and sat down to wait for the end. The disintegration went on, accompanied by horrible cracks and rumbling. The valves that restrained the Medical Apparatus must have weakened, for it ruptured and hung hideously from the ceiling. The floor heaved and fell and flung her from the chair. A tube oozed towards her serpent fashion. And at last the final horror approached - light began to ebb, and she knew that civilization's long day was closing. 

She whirled around, praying to be saved from this, at any rate, kissing the Book, pressing button after button. The uproar outside was increasing, and even penetrated the wall. Slowly the brilliancy of her cell was dimmed, the reflections faded from the metal switches. Now she could not see the reading-stand, now not the Book, though she held it in her hand. Light followed the flight of sound, air was following light, and the original void returned to the cavern from which it has so long been excluded. Vashti continued to whirl, like the devotees of an earlier religion, screaming, praying, striking at the buttons with bleeding hands. It was thus that she opened her prison and escaped - escaped in the spirit: at least so it seems to me, ere my meditation closes. That she escapes in the body - I cannot perceive that. She struck, by chance, the switch that released the door, and the rush of foul air on her skin, the loud throbbing whispers in her ears, told her that she was facing the tunnel again, and that tremendous platform on which she had seen men fighting. They were not fighting now. Only the whispers remained, and the little whimpering groans. They were dying by hundreds out in the dark. 

She burst into tears. 

Tears answered her. 

They wept for humanity, those two, not for themselves. They could not bear that this should be the end. Ere silence was completed their hearts were opened, and they knew what had been important on the earth. Man, the flower of all flesh, the noblest of all creatures visible, man who had once made god in his image, and had mirrored his strength on the constellations, beautiful naked man was dying, strangled in the garments that he had woven. Century after century had he toiled, and here was his reward. Truly the garment had seemed heavenly at first, shot with colours of culture, sewn with the threads of self-denial. And heavenly it had been so long as man could shed it at will and live by the essence that is his soul, and the essence, equally divine, that is his body. The sin against the body - it was for that they wept in chief; the centuries of wrong against the muscles and the nerves, and those five portals by which we can alone apprehend - glozing it over with talk of evolution, until the body was white pap, the home of ideas as colourless, last sloshy stirrings of a spirit that had grasped the stars. 

'Where are you?' she sobbed. 

His voice in the darkness said, 'Here.' 

Is there any hope, Kuno?' 

'None for us.' 

'Where are you?' 

She crawled over the bodies of the dead. His blood spurted over her hands. 

'Quicker,' he gasped, 'I am dying - but we touch, we talk, not through the Machine.' 

He kissed her. 

'We have come back to our own. We die, but we have recaptured life, as it was in Wessex, when Aelfrid overthrew the Danes. We know what they know outside, they who dwelt in the cloud that is the colour of a pearl.' 

'But Kuno, is it true? Are there still men on the surface of the earth? Is this - tunnel, this poisoned darkness - really not the end?' 

He replied: 

'I have seen them, spoken to them, loved them. They are hiding in the midst and the ferns until our civilization stops. Today they are the Homeless - tomorrow----- ' 

'Oh, tomorrow - some fool will start the Machine again, tomorrow.' 

'Never,' said Kuno, 'never. Humanity has learnt its lesson.' 

As he spoke, the whole city was broken like a honeycomb. An air-ship had sailed in through the vomitory into a ruined wharf. It crashed downwards, exploding as it went, rending gallery after gallery with its wings of steel. For a moment they saw the nations of the dead, and, before they joined them, scraps of the untainted sky.

WELL this is interesting. We've just got access to EPOS data for the first time - the volume and value of sales that actually go through the till, rather than that which we ship to customers' warehouses and stores. Some of our sell through is very good - like Adept which has shipped 50,000 units and sold 41,000 units, or Boxing Fitness which has shipped around 10,000 units and sold 7000. The remainder, of course, is stock on hand in customers' warehouses and stores. But there is one book which shall remain nameless which has only sold 34 units having shipped 359 (originally we shipped more than 2000 but had high returns on it - can't imagine why with that stellar sales rate.) Boo. 

So this heralds a new era for Snowbooks of knowing what our sales rates are. It will help us to know whether we should reprint a title, and will help to forecast returns. Looking at our Christmas sales data, by my reckoning, if we have, say, 50% of the Christmas stock remaining in store returned to us, that will come to &pound;28,000 which will need crediting in the New Year - which is about a 20% return rate. Now you can figure out roughly what our Christmas sales have been - and overall they've been great (although some lines had the potential to do so much better). Who knows what the actual return rate will be, but if they are this high, sales next spring/summer have to be even higher to accommodate them. Better get my selling hat on, then...","","","","","2006-12-21","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Just over two thousand years ago, on this very day, Santa Claus started work. No one really knows, but judging from his fondness for fur-trimmed clothing and his taste in pets, many people think that Santa must have grown up some distance from where his future employer, Jesus, was born. In the early days, Santa preferred to dress in green and had a dark beard, but gradually, because of Inflation, he needed more money for presents, which were expensive, and eventually he was forced to accept a sponsorship deal from Coca Cola, who made him dress in their corporate colours (and dyed his beard white to match).","Beyond that, it's difficult to be sure about Santa's early life, because in those  days, there wasn't much proper news. News originally came in two forms, neither of them  as good as our modern news. There was gossip, which lawyers today call hearsay and won't let you say in court, and there was also history, which is a sort of news where everything is badly out of date. And that was the situation for some time. Then - many, many years later - the printing press was invented and this brought about the possibility of up-to-date news. But still, for a while, there were no newspapers, only inflammatory pamphlets, which were rather biased. Eventually Queen Victoria came along and everybody got the hang of machinery and stopped putting their clogs in it and people began to read 'the news'. Mainly this was about various big boats sinking and about how the British Army was beating all other countries in rather a heroic fashion. As more people read the news, newspapers got bigger, eventually including news that hadn't happened yet, like 'op eds', and news that was never likely to happen, like horoscopes. All this cost a lot of money, and someone worked out that there was another sort of news they could include: news about lovely new products and services. They could print these stories in exchange for some money from the purveyors of those very same lovely products and services. Some readers grumbled about this, so the newspapers agreed to put a little box around the advertisements so that no one would think the newspaper actually stood by any of the claims being made in them. Although the box around adverts was just a thin line of ink, it served an important purpose. Without it, it was possible for Democracy to become Imperilled. Democracy was also a relatively new invention, but a very important one. In Democracy, ordinary people are allowed to say what they want and then the government has to do it, because the country really belongs to the ordinary people. This is very similar to Communism where everything also belongs to the ordinary people, but in Communism the government carries out the will of the people without remembering to ask what it is first. Also the food is not so good. Given the choice, most people prefer Democracy (but of course under Communism, nobody takes the trouble to find that out). One worry with Democracy is the concern that only important people really understand how to make big decisions and know what is going on in the world. If true, there is a danger that ordinary people will vote for the wrong thing by accident or because they are very confused or slow witted. Many leaders worry that this is in fact the case. To help with this, politicians make the questions they ask the ordinary people quite simple. They have narrowed it down to a single question in which they ask whether the ordinary people would like them to do some more governing and the people can say no if they want and then someone else gets a chance. This is very simple but there is still the problem of the ordinary people accidentally deciding the wrong thing, so it is important that ordinary people read newspapers, so as not to put the wrong politicians in charge. This is where the line of ink round adverts comes in. If it wasn't there, bad politicians could give some money to the newspaper who could report that they had checked out these bad politicians and found them actually to be very good people and full of excellent ideas, so everyone should vote for them. Hence ink boxes. Unfortunately for democracy, Capitalism (which was the invention that had allowed the British Empire to stop the sun setting on it) brought with it Consumerism, wherein everyone thinks too much about buying things. In Consumerism, everything has to be fun and 'the latest thing' and no one has any self control or wants to be bored. And this is a problem, because many newspapers are of quite a boring nature. One solution was to include photographs of naked ladies in the newspapers, just inside the front cover, so that everyone would think, well this isn't so bad, and would keep reading. This was partly successful, although on average it worked better with men readers than women, but it wasn't enough, especially as television had been invented and now news seemed even more boring by comparison. The next solution that was tried was to apply Democracy to the news, by putting on more news stories that people liked and not harping on about the dull ones so much. The problem with this was that instead of applying Democracy, the news people accidentally applied Consumerism instead and now they were forced to make the news fun. So, many news stories became about celebrities. If those celebrities were also naked ladies, then that was ideal. There was also room for gruesome news because people always feel compelled to listen to grisliness in case things have got so bad that they need to move to a different country. So the news people would combine celebrity news with the most gruesome events they could find. This gave ordinary people the impression that life was made up of a fifty-fifty mix of naked celebrities and horrible murders, and it didn't help them choose a good government either, but it was fun. Sadly, it was also expensive, so the TV news had to make money through adverts too - and they had to say when the adverts were on, so you wouldn't confuse it with the actual news, but they used commercial breaks for that rather than ink boxes because of the different way television works. For a while things went well, but then someone realised that very famous celebrities are known all over the world, so it was pointless to have lots of local newspapers, TV and radio stations chasing them. They could be chased much better by big, international media companies. That also worked well with the gruesome murders, because even though local murders are best, people will still pay attention to a horrible murder a long way away, if it is really very grisly (or it involves some celebrities). Now, with everyone's money being spent on Consumerism, lots of companies did very well and the news media were no exception. Unfortunately, some countries had rules about what those media companies could do and this was considered Restrictive. For instance, there might be a rule that one person couldn't buy up all the news, TV and radio stations in a town because then they might get tempted to tell everyone something that wasn't true, and then because it was on all the radio and TV stations and also in the newspapers everyone might believe it. So laws were passed and those laws were bad for the economy. That's because when ordinary people do things it doesn't show up properly in economic figures but if companies can get ordinary people to hand money over to them then that does show up in figures and the economy is improved. So the media companies grumbled to the governments of the world that things were unfair and there were too many laws stopping them, but the governments had their own problems and weren't convinced. The leaders said: what if the media companies get too powerful and tell lies and everyone believes them and so maybe the laws should stay. But the media companies kept grumbling, and one group of politicians (mainly made up of people who liked to run big businesses) said, well, if we were in power we would help but you'd still have to behave. And the media companies said OK, we'll behave, you'll see. And after that both sides became the best of friends. This system worked well because the politicians could make sure that no lies were told on the news by threatening to change the laws back to what they used to be which would mean pulling apart the big media companies, so the big media companies knew to behave, and many of them got very large indeed and joined up with other big businesses. In some countries the media even got money directly from the government instead of from adverts so they had extra reasons not to tell lies about the things the politicians paid attention to (which was mainly news about themselves). Because of the way this agreement worked, it was probably a good thing that the news was about grisliness and celebrities both for reasons of being accurate and because that kept everyone happy. If the news had been about which big media companies were misbehaving it might have been a problem because all the people reporting the news worked for big media companies and so they might have got into trouble with their bosses for telling on them or not been allowed to tell in the first place. It might also be a problem if the news had to talk about the politicians because under the current system the politicians could get cross with them. Because the politicians were still in charge of keeping the laws from bothering the news companies, the news companies tried not to say anything too rude about them. By this time of course, most news companies were so large that they weren't really afraid of the politicians but even so they tried to make sure their news about politicians was mainly Juicy Scandals and reporting on individual bad politicians rather than complaining about bigger things and having the risk of annoying a whole lot of politicians at once and maybe starting a big row. So in theory, the only two problems with this system was that news about media companies and news about the government would both be a bit ropey and unreliable - which was sort of OK because no one cared about that sort of news - but then the other big businesses had an idea. Since politicians could threaten the news companies with laws, big businesses realised they could do some threatening of their own and they had something that was better than laws, which was money. Big businesses spent a lot of money on adverts and without that money the newspapers wouldn't be able to afford ink and paper and the TV companies wouldn't be able to afford the modern equivalent of ink and paper that TV uses. If big businesses were unhappy with the news they could give their advert money to someone else and see whether that helped. In fact it helped a lot because there were no longer any news companies who could survive without lots of money from adverts. Even the newspapers spent a lot more money than they made from selling their papers. So now the problem with this system included all big business, plus the government, which was still OK because no one was paying attention to those areas. And then things got even worse because big business realised that if adverts worked on ordinary people and the money from adverts helped them get their way with the news people, then maybe adverts were the answer to everything. They tried using adverts on the government. The media companies had managed to get some nicer laws from the government and now other companies wanted nicer laws too which were less Restrictive. Plus, because of the way the figures worked, it would be good for the economy, even if ordinary people were a bit worse off. So big businesses started making adverts about themselves for the benefit of politicians and this was called 'lobbying'. This was so successful that it in turn gave politicians the idea of having their own adverts to persuade ordinary people to think well of them, which was very clever, except that they didn't have any money for it. So big businesses very kindly offered to help with that and donate money to politicians to spend on adverts but on the understanding that things were not so Restrictive in future, and they winked when they said this. So by now everyone was using adverts on everyone else and nobody could be rude about anyone important without lots of trouble for all concerned. And all this would have been absolutely fine but then the world had a crisis. In fact there were three crisises. One was wars, which had been unpopular for a while, but that was only because they were Restrictive and bad for the economy. Once a way was found to make sure the money spent on wars went to big business no one minded (except ordinary people because they had to pay for it and also they tended to be the ones the war was on). The second problem was poor people of which there were too many and this can lead to Unrest, which is bad for everyone and so politicians preferred not to talk about it. And thirdly there was a problem with the atmosphere and weather in that it was no longer working properly because of smoke and pollution. These three things needed a lot of sorting out but no one wanted to be the first to bring it up because no one wanted to be blamed for it. The media companies would sometimes drop hints but they couldn't blame the government, big business or their bosses so these hints were not very good. The only hope for the world was Santa and/or Book Tokens (which are another Christmas tradition). All the big disasters that weren't being talked about on the news were getting made into books because that was safe as no one reads depressing books about things going all horribly wrong except perhaps other people writing similar depressing books. But during Christmas there is often time for ordinary people to have some respite from their toiling and to sit in comfy chairs. This is an ideal time for them to read books if they have any or if Santa has brought them some. Even if he hasn't specifically brought books there might be Book Tokens which are popular with Aunts - or even five pound notes which are nearly as good. These should be swapped for books by the following authors so that there can be many more Christmases and ordinary people can make sure that the many large crisises around the world are gradually fixed. And in conclusion: Happy Christmas and God Bless Us, every one.

<font color=""darkblue"" size=+1>Authors/Books</font>
<strong>Baghdad Burning by Riverbend</strong>
<font color=""darkgray"">The more time one spends reading Riverbend (a young woman who lives in Baghdad) the more it becomes clear that dropping bombs on her or shooting at her family is not the right way to behave. </font>
Anything by <strong>Joseph Stiglitz</strong>
<font color=""darkgray"">It seems more than a coincidence that the world contains two good things that end in 'iglitz' but it's true. Joseph Stiglitz has a Nobel prize in being good at economics and he used to advise Pres. Clinton and the World Bank on What's Best. Without reading his books it might not be clear why everyone else in the world gets so cross with The West. </font>
Anything by <strong>Naomi Klein</strong>
<font color=""darkgray"">There are many reasons to read books by Naomi Klein besides the obvious one of wanting to go out with her. But given that she is married, perhaps it's best to focus on the messages of vital importance in her writing. </font>
<strong>Overthrow by Stephen Kinzer</strong>
<font color=""darkgray"">A lot of people thought that invading Iraq was a bit out of character for America. Stephen Kinzer very amiably tells the story of the other fourteen governments the US has overthrown in the last century or so. </font>
<strong>Confessions of an Economic Hitman by John Perkins</strong>
<font color=""darkgray"">I really can't decide if he's telling the truth, but if he is we should all be very cross. And he certainly does a grand job of tying together economic, military and foreign policy with stuff about secret agents. </font>
<strong>Iraq Confidential by Scott Ritter</strong>
<font color=""darkgray"">One of the excuses for accidentally invading Iraq was that 'everyone believed' they had stacks of evil weapons. Scott Ritter knew they didn't and he tried to tell everyone. But what would he know? He was only the American in charge of the U.N. Weapons Inspection Team for most of the Nineties. </font>
Anything by <strong>Greg Palast</strong>
<font color=""darkgray"">I can't pin down Greg Palast's style. I suspect his body produces some sort of natural amphetamine. Whatever, he's an incredible investigative journalist. One of about three left on the planet. </font>
<strong>Noam Chomsky</strong>'s political writing
<font color=""darkgray"">He seems to write a couple of books per week, but not without good reason. All sorts of things start to make sense after reading Chomsky - and not in a loony, paranoid way. (Understanding Power is the most reader-friendly that I've read.) </font>
<strong>The Great Unravelling by Paul Krugman</strong>
<font color=""darkgray"">He's the sane one at the New York Times and knows A Fair Bit about how money works. </font>
Anything by <strong>Amy Goodman</strong>
<font color=""darkgray"">Or better still, get your daily news from her by listening to DemocracyNow.org. If I had more gumption, I would go and work for her. </font>
<strong>Gore Vidal</strong>'s political writing
<font color=""darkgray"">His fiction is a little bit (cough) grown-up for my liking but his political thoughts are super and don't make me blush as much. </font>
<strong>A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn</strong>
<font color=""darkgray"">It turns out that history isn't just rich white gentlemen having disputes. I was not told this in school.</font>
<strong>The Great War for Civilisation by Robert Fisk </strong>
<font color=""darkgray"">It's a bit cheeky recommending this as I'm only halfway through it, but in my defence it's blimin' huge. R. Fisk is also on the very short list of journalists I'm inclined to trust.</font>","","","","2006-12-25","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

And so we smash into the new year with a bang and a crash and an ooohahhhthat'saprettyonewow. With the exception of the stupid ones that just go up and go bang, which are the only ones our neighbours ever buy, I like fireworks because they're exciting and you don't get to watch people play with explosives very often, especially not that close to the Houses of Parliament where they generally frown upon that manner of thing. They are also a good symbolic way of blowing up the last year leaving it all fresh for the future. I've got to say, though, that there wasn't much in 2006 that I wanted to blow up. We won a prize, we published some excellent, award winning books like The Romanian (which you should buy on principle to celebrate same country's accesssion to the EU today) and we published books that people tell us they reallly loved, like Plotting for Beginners, The Other Eden and the Crafter's Companion. I tell you, it's really wonderful when - without being prompted - people just email you to say how great your books are. In 2006 we also planned all of our 2007 books, which you don't know much about yet but ooh, I can't wait to share them with you because YOU WILL LOVE THEM. At least some of them, anyway - Ground Fighting might not be everyone's cup of tea, I admit. 

But even though 2006 was pretty darned super, it's still hard-coded into my DNA to make new year resolutions. So here they are. I'm going to summarise the personal ones into one because they're boring.","1) Lose weight, drink more water, train more, pass the first year of my open university degree (I've enrolled to study politics, philosophy and economics because I need to know more about these things), be more patient, be less scathing to people who bug me, find a way to express why I loathe George Bush et al without resorting to expletives. Personal ones over. 

2) Win some award or other for the company. I think it's a good goal. 

3) Win some award or other for one of our books. Hot tips: The Red Men, Taking the Plunge, Deep Hanging Out, Needle in the Blood and Lint. 

4) Get absolutely flawless IT, including upgrading the website, perfecting our ONIX processes and making sure computers do as much of our jobs as possible, so we don't have to. 

5) SELL MORE BOOKS.

6) Find a way to help unpublished writers more than we do at the moment without going bust or spending every waking hour critiquing their work. 

7) Engage more with readers and don't rely on anecdote to decide whether people like our books or not. 

8) NO MORE ADVERTISING. I promised I'd report back; turns out it doesn't work. 

9) Try not to worry so much. 

10) SELL MORE BOOKS.

If I can find this post this time next year I'll see how I did. Happy new year and thanks, sincerely, for being so nice to us in 2006. Please don't stop.","","","","2007-01-01","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

It prints in any language and has an upper limit of 550 pages. The 'Espresso' will be launched first in several US libraries. The company behind the project - On Demand Books - predicts that, within five years, it will be able to reproduce every book ever published.""

This is larking about with dynamite I suspect, but I'm going to quickly try to touch on both religion and politics in this post before running for cover and trying never to mention them again.","First, I've just finished Richard Dawkins's book The God Delusion. I'd like to recommend it but I'm unable, to the point of being rather amused at my inability, to think of a single thing to say about it that won't upset someone. And I don't want to do that. I will say that I found the first third of it to be laugh-out-loud funny. I'll totally understand if no one else feels that way, but I was very tickled. And with the best will in the world, I didn't expect to find Prof. Dawkins funny. His expression always looks too sharp for that (though the recent realisation that he is married to a former Doctor Who companion has made him seem much less austere). But I think he was helped along here by having a whole new fertile field of comedy to himself. Those of a religious persuasion, please try not to hate me for saying this, but to the outsider some scriptural beliefs can seem rather farfetched. This book is the first time I can recall anyone daring to say it. And then having some fun with the idea. If I believed in hell I'd certainly expect to be going there now because even though I knew it was wrong, I laughed anyway. So for the liberal but ungodly among you, The God Delusion is quite the guilty pleasure. It's full of things you've probably longed to say your whole life but knew you weren't allowed to. I would not be surprised if it gradually sells more and more, until it begins to set records.

And still with Professor Dawkins, but moving onto the second taboo, I note he has a piece in today's Guardian and its appearance has crystallised another prediction I want to make. I think that politics is about to become popular again. I foresee a lot of formerly non-political people wading into public debate on matters of foreign policy, human rights and international relations. I know, to digress for a moment, that I'm not the only one to find the BBC's shipping forecast comforting - the impression that while we sleep, the Empire is in the hands of steady, sensible chaps (of both sexes) with clipboards and a solid grasp of what needs to be done. And we all hope that something of the sort really does occur in Whitehall and Westminster, freeing us up to fret about the small stuff. Well that compact, the basis on which most of us neglect the news and busy ourselves with matters closer to home, has certainly seen better days. Prof. Dawkins, past and present, can be taken to illustrate the point nicely. 'Each to their own,' he has previously seemed to say. 'I will give myself over to the minute study of Natural Selection on the understanding that others are tackling diplomacy, the legal system and the general piloting of the ship of state with similar diligence and dexterity'. And I think he's not been the only one to think that way. You can try to get any of us to pay attention to weighty matters or great moral dilemmas but our reply is, as Eddie Izzard puts it, 'Look, I'm trying to cook some eggs here.' The shift I see coming is that Prof. Dawkins and others are realising that politics in the real world is a postgraduate subject being performed to GCSE standard. 'Surely,' I imagine him thinking now, 'politics can't be any more tricky to understand than evolution'. I think one gradual consequence of the developments of the last five years or so will be the de-mystification of politics. While many conceded that it wasn't especially honourable or interesting, politics was assumed to be difficult and arcane. I think the second half of this decade will see the end of that belief and more of a sense of 'oh, give it here' taking hold among the big cheeses of all disciplines. So quick! Everyone, start writing accessible and/or funny political books and if they're very amusing perhaps we can publish one. Assuming it won't get us into any trouble.","","","","2007-01-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

This is our office. Students, here is your first interview question: approximately how many people can you fit in it? Answer: three, which is how many sit in it at the moment. We used to run a work experience programme, and it was good for us and good for the students - the only downside being they stole our oxygen. But we've come up with a plan! 

If you would like to be considered for Snowbooks Remote Experience Programme, email me with your CV and a covering letter. We get the help without having to play sardines; you get the experience on your CV, some handy skills and no travel expenses. Needless to say the work experience is unpaid and there are no delicious expenses to be had - but you'll be helping out with things like proofreading, marketing, sales, and editorial. We'll only take on one person at a time and will communicate via email and Skype. You'll need your own computer and broadband.

2007 has got off to a jolly wonderful start with the news that the Arts Council London has very kindly awarded us a &pound;25,000 grant. Wow! 

It is to support our ""Snowbooks 2.0"" plan, so-named with a nod to ""Web 2.0"", the catchall phrase for the increased interactivity and growing elegance and professionalism in web development. We will use it to upgrade our IT hardware and software, and to support the publication of our 2007 contemporary fiction titles. These include Lint by Steve Aylett (""the most original voice in the literary scene"" - Michael Moorcock) (publication March 2007); Memphis Underground by Stewart Home (June 2007) and The Human War by Noah Cicero (April 2007) - but of course there will be a knock on effect on all our books. 

I feel very touched, because it's a lot of public money that they're entrusting us with. I promise to make good use of it and to make sure it benefits you directly by publishing wonderful books that you'll enjoy. Which, you know, we'd do anyway but this should result in our books reaching a wider audience. As it was reported in The Bookseller this morning, I've already had emails from various software consultants hoping to relieve me of the burden of all that money - thanks, boys, but I think we'll just about struggle through...

Lovely Arts Council - demonstrating once again that they underpin so much in the independent publishing arena. Gawd bless 'em.","","","","","2007-01-05","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","5"
"40811","","1","Is Being Small A Problem?","Publish","true","Or, Why Don't People Look At The P&L?
Or, It's Not The Size, It's The Editorial Strategy That Matters

<img alt=""oxygen2.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/oxygen2.jpg"" width=""220"" height=""220"" />

I read a fascinating <a href=""http://www.thefridayproject.co.uk/hi/pack/001047.php#comments"">post over at Scott's blog</a> about promotional compliance. General summary: promotions (3 for 2s and the like) in large retailers can sell a hell of a lot of books, and so publishers are happy to pay for inclusion in them - but it all goes a bit wrong, for both publishers and retailers, when the books don't appear where they're meant to. Well worth a read. 

However, it was the comments to the post that were even more interesting as in a few short sentences they highlighted some of the misconceptions that have been bugging me of late - well, for the last three years - and made me ask the question - is being small the problem that everyone makes out?","<strong>Sales vs profit. </strong>

The first interesting thing about Scott's comments suggests that sales are the holy grail. One commenter insisted that ""Tube ads sell books"", and was thus of the opinion that Tube ads are what publishers should invest in. Yeeees - have you ever looked at the rate card of tube ads? &pound;15,000 for one poster on the escalators per week rising to at least &pound;150,000 for a modest cross-London campaign? It's not a question of 'tube ads sell books'; it needs to be a question of 'do tube ads sell sufficiently high numbers of books to even pay for the cost of running those ads, let alone contribute to the costs of print, instore promotion, development and all the other elements that make up the title's P&L?' (Of course, that's how Scott replied because he is right-thinking.)

I'm not even sure that many publishers run P&Ls by title. At Snowbooks we're just in the middle of writing our own software to automatically run monthly title P&Ls, because you can't buy such software off the shelf - there's no demand for it. Publishers seem only to care about volume and value sales. I don't need to point out that if you sell a million pounds worth of a book, but pay a five hundred thousand advance, plus spend quarter of a million on a national ad campaign, plus a hundred thousand for print, production and payroll costs, plus two hundred thousand royalties, you have, quite spectacularly, made what looks like a success into a dismal failure. 

It's the ingrained idiocy of large companies. They can't help it - they're all bright individuals - but something happens to bright people when they have to work together in functional silos (specialised departments, like marketing, sales, editorial, HR - you know). People have to be measured on things so that the management can keep tabs on them (and so that HR can claim they actually do something) and that's where it starts to unravel. You measure the sales and marketing department, say, on whether the books make it into the Nielsen top 50. Sounds reasonable; encourages a bit of competition with the other big houses and if a book is selling well that's a lot of money coming into the business, right? Thing is, that's just a volume and value sales measure. Marketing may be measured on their sales, and top line on the amount they spend, but without a title level P&L who's to know whether 90% of books are losing money? Whether the mechanics you used to get a book into the top 50 at any cost - tube ads, PR campaigns, launch parties, huge proof print runs - ended up making you a loss? And if you don't know whether 90% of books are losing money, how can you go back to the commissioning editors to have a few stiff words with them? To quote one of the cheesiest training presentations I ever saw - sales are vanity, profit is sanity. Oh, and cash is king. Which you knew.  

So to return to my question - being small is quite helpful in this regard, because it's much easier to track what's working and what's not, and to tweak our direction accordingly. We don't have all the costs of the larger companies - and, thank god, we don't have to tie ourselves up in knots creating false measures to live and die by. 

<strong>Size vs Editorial direction.</strong>

The second misconception I picked up was that small publishers are disadvantaged because we can't get onto promotions. Er, no. 

Some small publishers might not be able to get onto promotions - but it's because their lists are specialised. It's not their size that stops them, it's their editorial strategy (and sometimes their poor execution of cover designs and typesetting). Some large publishers don't get their books into promotions, because they are business books, or legal books, or IT books, and no amount of price discounting is going to encourage a browser to buy the latest treatise on Tort law or Perl for UNIX programming. 

The phrase the commenter used was ""... so very many smaller publishers get shafted because they can't afford to get their books into promotions."" Er, no. Promotions, more often than not, sell sufficient quantities of the right sort of books (commercial fiction and non-fiction) to pay for all the costs associated with publishing that title - I have a huge wodge of proof if anyone wants to contest that. If promotions sell sufficient books, the publisher has enough money to afford them.  I agree that there may be cash flow issues that restrict publishers from joining in on all the promotions they'd like to - but cash flow issues don't stop them printing books, or paying authors advances. Please - don't assume that because publishers are small they are automatically restricted from involving themselves in promotions. If they publish the sort of books that do well on those promotions, publishers are treated the same regardless of their size. <strong>It's the editorial output that matters.</strong> 

<strong>It Could Be So Much Worse</strong>

The market we exist in *is* tough - because of curve balls that the market throws at us from time to time like weak compliance, missed payments, expensive paper, exchange rates, and the ever present need for more working capital. But we are tremendously lucky in ways that are taken for granted. We have never written a cheque to the VAT man, for example. It can't last - is Chantelle's biography really a VAT-free necessity? - but while it does it's a source of great jealousy from our non-publisher peers. And you have *no idea* how brutal retailers can be to their suppliers - multiple book retailers are nuns in comparison. No, not nuns, kittens. Er, no - er, just - just very nice. They are, compared to other companies I've worked with, incredibly interested in sourcing product from a wide supply base and happy to incur the extra cost and spend the extra time it takes to engage with smaller suppliers to deliver a wide range of books to their customers. And gawd love 'em for it. 

So in summary: being small is not as dangerous as people say it is. There is no size-related entry requirement to access retailers' 3 for 2 tables. It just depends on the books you publish and the way you publish them.","","","","2007-01-07","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

I know I love my job, and Snowbooks, and everything, but I'm really struggling on this one. I am on a mission to become the best martial arts publisher in the world which is why I'm publishing a book called Ground Fighting, amongst others, later this year. A sneak preview of some of the spreads is above. A lot of martial arts books have greyscale photos, which are quite hard to follow, and our difference is that we have nice, crisp, colour photos with their backgrounds clipped away, and clear design, and high quality editing - which is all great, but it TAKES SOOO LONG. Especially when you have 1200 (one thousand two hundred - I repeat so it will sink in, because that is a lot) photos. So here's what needs to be done on the images: 

- Take 5000 photos
- Select the best 1200
- Clip out the backgrounds of those 1200 photos (takes between 10-15 minutes per photo. Yup - a month's solid work. Remember that I'm also sales and marketing director, FD, bibliographic data manager etc.)
- Place each photo in the right sequence into the layout

At stages 1-3 it was too depressing to blog about this because there was still so much to do - but now all the photos are selected and clipped out. I'm now half way through placing them into the layout. 

I tell you, this book had better sell otherwise not only is that money down the drain, it is the best years of my life - or so it feels. Think of me on this blustery Saturday when you're out scuffing through leaves, playing in the park or whatever it is you do with your weekends. Think of me pressing ctrl-D, select, ctrl-shift-drag, click, move, deselect over and over and over and over and over again... 

// Update, late at night: Finished placing the photos! Yey! I feel like I've climbed the Himalayas or one of those desert endurance races, although on the plus side there's considerably less sweating involved in typesetting. Good news all round. //","","","","","2007-01-13","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

So, being a worrier, I worry about things, like whether I'm getting enough vitamins, and when will the heating be fixed (nice timing, no?) and whether we're building a company that actually has some inherent value rather than just being a collection of project managers that organise other people. And because I worry about it, we're probably ok, because we've gone to great lengths to actually <em>do </em>the things that publishers are meant to do, like sales and marketing, and cover design, and layout, and reading manuscripts, and editing, and bibliographic data management, and everything - which sounds odd if you're reading this from a vantage point outside of publishing, because you'd think 'of course they do - that's publishing'. But a lot of publishers outsource all that stuff, which is a perfectly viable strategy - it just means that your company is a bit of a shell; a hub rather than a place of craftsmanship and skills. 

So hopefully we'll be ok when the revolution comes - we'll have skills to fall back on and people will feel that we add value to the supply chain (see unimaginitive picture, above. Do you see what I've done? Supply chain? See how I've used a chain, there? Oh, never mind.*) Because you have to make damn sure that if you're in the bits between the red dots - all the stuff that goes on between the author and the reader - you're doing something that matters, otherwise big, or agile, or both, non-book-trade companies or groups of people, who know lots about computers and internets and the like, will swoop down in the not too distant future and do what you're doing, only better. Maybe. Probably.

And that brings me - finally - to the point of this post, which concerns another group of other players in the supply chain: agents.","This is going to sound like some awful, xenophobic, Celebrity-Big-Brother cliche, but here we go... Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are agents. Well, they're not, actually, but there are some really nice ones out there. The problem is that I'm just not convinced that they have thought through their business model. What, exactly, do they do? Or more precisely, what is it they do that is safe from being replaced in the new, connected, digitised era that beckons? 

See, agents are responsible for sourcing talent and making it available to publishers - to narrow the selection for them. Then they are responsible for negotiating a good deal on behalf of the author. Maybe some of the better ones also take it upon themselves to manage the author's expectations; to garner publicity using their contacts; to sell translation rights. Thing is, there's nothing there that is particularly unique. 

Take sourcing talent. I'm not convinced that agents have a particular talent for spotting brilliant writing. I'm even less convinced - borne out by experience - that they have an eye for spotting writing that will sell in any quantity. And in the light of initiatives like www.thefrontlist.com, I can really see the filtering process moving to a situation where readers - good god, the customer! - peer review prospective authors. Surely that would be more useful to the publisher - to know that 100 people read and enjoyed the book, rather than one agent who, to be blunt, is in it for the money, as are we all. 

That point about not being able to spot what will sell in quantity: agents are not retailers. They don't have a sense of passion about retail; the theatre of the store, the pride that comes from constructing a balanced, easy to shop range,  the enjoyment to be had by talking to customers, feeling that you've made a difference to their experience, that they've gone away happy and will come back for more. No, agents like Soho. They like being part of the literary world; they like discovering authors and reading great writing but it is not their priority, in their heart of hearts, to get that writing out to the masses. If it was they'd have gone into retail. 

Now take negotiating contracts. How many agents are trained lawyers? If I was going to give away 10% of my earnings I'd rather pay an experienced, insured lawyer, or consult an independent body like the Society of Authors who vet a contract for you for free. 

I think that some agents are invaluable, and that the higher up the celebrity spectrum you go the more sense it makes. Famous people can usually afford to have a staff to manage their affairs, and their contracts may involve complicated cross-media clauses that need an expert eye. Mind you, isn't an expert eye a lawyer, not an agent? Still, they can afford to have someone act on their behalf, so that's fine. 

But down the non-celebrity, middle market and debut author market, I feel that agents compound the problems of books being a closed-off world; a near impossible world to break into unless you have good contacts; a world of elitism and, dare I say it, snobbery. Publishers are getting really good at embracing the digital age - and sourcing manuscripts for less money has got to be a huge cost saving win for them. 

I've gone through this whole post so far without mentioning any of the anecdotal things that have happened to us when using agents. We've had an agent who has sold a book to us, only to retract it and sell it to someone else when a better deal came along. We've had an agent who promised that they would do loads of marketing for us, but then just emailed through a list of literary editors - uh, yes, we know who Boyd Tonkin and Jane Mays are - and suggested we phone them. We've heard of an agent who told an author that they need to find a really good accountant as they'd be so wealthy with their book they would have to manage their taxes really well. They never sold the book. 

What do you think? Do you think agents will survive into the future? Do they add sufficient value? What are your experiences? 


* In fact, why is it a straight line? Why isn't there a loopy bit going back from the reader to the author? Authors get so little feedback. Maybe it's why the industry pumps out thousands more books a year than the reading population can ever get through - because we have no idea what readers want so we just throw whatever we can at them until we get lucky and something sticks.","","","","2007-01-31","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

I've just emailed <a href=""http://meandmybigmouth.typepad.com/"">Scott at TFP </a>to ask for the name of his chippie that he recommended because our shelves in our spare bedroom at home are so over-stocked that they're hanging off the wall at a very odd angle, ready to fall off and smash into bits any moment now. They're practically defying gravity, when you look at them. I always tread very carefully when I go in. And no, I didn't finish In Search of Lost Time. 

And creeping about under them reminds me of a time when I was grubbing around under a shelf, stood up too quickly and knocked the Reader's Digest Book of DIY off its perch, which fell on my head and cut it open. I still have the scar and a sore patch, five years later. It got me thinking: what other books have led to pain and misery? Here are my top five.","1) Reader's Digest DIY book, as above. 

2) Jane Austen's Emma. I couldn't stop reading it when I was meant to be revising for my mock A levels. I did very badly as a result, and didn't realise that those results would be used as my forecast grades for my UCCA form. Cue a lot of hard work and begging and heartache that could have been avoided. 

3) The Good News Bible. I was given one when I got confirmed when I was 14 or so, and read it - twice. It made absolutely no sense to me at all. I really wanted to believe in god because I thought I would burn in a firey fireball of fire for all eternity if I didn't, but the bible gave me nothing to believe in. I genuinely went through a lot of anguish until I started my history A level, put it all in context, and formed my current atheistic view of religion. It makes me very, er, cross that the church should put a child through that, at the same time as all those hormones and hard academic work.

4)  Martin Amis' London Fields.  It thoroughly depressed me and touched a nerve as at the time I was feeling very anti-London. For weeks afterwards everywhere I went I saw blackness and dirt and cruelty in people and sordidity. Maybe that makes it a good book, in that it stays with you, but I wished it would leave me alone. 

5) Retail Therapy by Rob Jones. This is an all-ends-well story because it resulted in the formation of Snowbooks, which I'm obviously very happy about - but at the time it was very sad. Rob got a publishing deal (with a very unimpressive advance) for this book, which he spent a good 6 months writing. It is a seminal work, in terms of both content and style, and could easily have been a cross-over mass market success.  However, the experience with the publisher was ghastly. They put it out as a hardback, gave it a bland cover, and tried hard to shoe-horn it into their useless series brand. I remember Rob telling me what happened in an editorial meeting. The editor was flicking through the manuscript and said 'Could you just put in, you know, a few more graphs?' Rob readily agreed, being an affable type, and asked which points the editor felt required support. 'Oh, nothing in particular - we would just like to see a few more pictures.' Pity the poor reader of that series. Rob's experience - and, as I'm his best pal, my experience too - was so rotten and demeaning and saddening that we thought we could easily do better. And we do! How's about that then. 

So those are mine. What about yours? We might have to do books of pleasure soon, to counter all this misery!","","","","2007-02-04","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

This is the second in an occasional series of what I have on at the moment. I always go on about how busy I am, but that's only because I like the sound of my own voice. The others in the office are slightly busier than me, but they're just better at managing their time and their temperament.","We use an excellent thing called Windows Small Business Server - rubbish screenshot above - which allows us to have a mini-intranet upon which we contain everything that's useful. Amongst other things, it records bitty bits of info like the weird code names of the CMYK printer cartridges our office printer burns through, and literary awards we've entered, and trading terms, and a record of what rights we've sold. It contains discussion boards where we brainstorm ideas for new titles. We keep a running corrections log - each of our books includes an email address where readers can email errors to and we log them ready for the next reprint. 

And it contains to do lists for a variety of things. There's the Uber List, which is a catch-all for everything that's going on - except for ongoing things that we do every week, like sales. There are also specific lists for particularly tricksy things to organise, like snowbooks design services cover designs (we do a lot, which need tracking) and the book fairs.

<p><strong>James Bridle (Snowbooks)</strong>: We really don&rsquo;t have a particular reader in mind. We publish a really diverse range of books &ndash; from mainstream thrillers to avant-garde contemporary literature, from gay memoir to martial arts and fitness guides &ndash; that we don&rsquo;t have a picture in our heads of a single type of <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/"" target=""_blank"">Snowbooks</a>&nbsp;reader. However, we do think that everybody can find something in our catalogue to love &ndash; for the simple reason that we love them all, and we know we&rsquo;re not alone...</p>

<p><strong>BD</strong>: What are the principal challenges/opportunities you see at the moment in the business of publishing books?</p>
<p><strong>JB</strong>: A lot depends where you are as a business, as small publishers like us face a very different set of challenges to the big corporations. However, I think the biggest threat to us all at the moment is oversaturation: people will always want to read, but with up to 10,000 books published every month, it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to pick up on the best: there&rsquo;s a danger that many deserving authors will fall under the radar, and people are losing faith in the ability of publishers to pick the best books.</p>
<p>The counter to that of course is that small publishers can build a reputation for quality books, carefully chosen and produced with care, and attract readers through their taste and consistency as much as through expensive ad campaigns and big-name authors. <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/"" target=""_blank"">Snowbooks</a>&nbsp;certainly aspires to such a status.</p>
<p><strong>BD</strong>: What brings you to the decision to publish a particular title/author?</p>
<p><strong>JB</strong>: Love for the book, over and above everything else. At <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/"" target=""_blank"">Snowbooks</a>, we work slightly differently to lots of other publishers: we&rsquo;re all editors as well as designers, proof-readers, production managers and publicists, and when we pick a book for publication, we know we&rsquo;re going to be working on it for months, so it had better be really good. The impulse behind that love may differ &ndash; a particularly lucid piece of fiction, or a particularly necessary piece of non-fiction, for example &ndash; but our prime motivation is personal enjoyment, because we believe that will then be passed on to the reader.</p>

<p><strong>BD</strong>: What books are you most proud of having published?</p>
<p><strong>JB</strong>: I can&rsquo;t speak for my colleagues, but personally I am particularly proud of Bruce Benderson&rsquo;s memoir <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/showbook.php?id=1905005180"">The Romanian</a> which won the <em>Prix De Flore</em> in France but received very little notice here, although it was mentioned in several newspapers&rsquo; end of year reviews. Simon Callow, who I won&rsquo;t attempt to top, called it &ldquo;one of the most devastating and unsparing accounts of amour fou I have ever read, providing at the same time an extraordinary glimpse into Romania's past and present.&rdquo; Likewise, <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/showbook.php?id=1905005202"">The Edgier Waters</a>, an anthology of new writing that first appeared in <a href=""http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/"" target=""_blank"">3:AM Magazine</a>, slipped under the critical radar but contained some extraordinary stuff by some really inspiring writers, many of whom I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be hearing more from before too long. </p>

<p><strong>BD</strong>: What books are you working on right now?</p>
<p><strong>JB</strong> Out this month is Mark Ames&rsquo; biting analysis of office and school shootings in the US, <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/showbook.php?id=1905005342"">Going Postal</a>, a book that absolutely tears into the modern culture of workplace pressure, harassment and victimisation &ndash; and people&rsquo;s willingness to go along with it. I&rsquo;m also preparing a number of novels which I can&rsquo;t wait to hit the bookstores &ndash; new books from Steve Aylett (<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005352.html"" target=""_blank"">Lint</a>), Stewart Home (<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005420.html"" target=""_blank"">Memphis Underground</a>) and exciting debuts from Noah Cicero (<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005468.html"" target=""_blank"">The Human War</a>) [the American small press release of which was reviewed over at <a href=""http://www.readysteadybook.com/BookReview.aspx?isbn=1879193116"" target=""_blank"">ReadySteadyBook</a>] and Matthew De Abaitua (<em>The Red Men</em>) &ndash; all writers who deserve your attention.

Happy Snowday! 

I  love it. I hardly slept last night as the met office ruined part of the fun by accurately forecasting that London was going to be visited by huge gollops of snow overnight. I prefer it when you wake up, expecting a normal grey day, and you're surprised by the world changing colour. 

I came to work on the bus today. I normally cycle but I might have fallen off and that would have ruined Snowday. Everyone was so cheerful! It must be like New Year's for the phone companies. Everyone's phone was going and the conversation was always the same. ""Yes, it's here too...Yes, it's really deep...Oh, I know. Do you think it will last?"" Some conversations went a stage further: ""So I saw Paul at the bus stop and he was going to throw this really big bit of snow at me but I said Paul, oy, don't throw that big bit of snow at me, it might have dog poo in it, pack it in, and he didn't thank god, but I said I'd get him back later"" etc. 

Above is the first of many many photos which will be taken today. I had to get the serious pack shot in quick, just in case the snow melted. That is a lovely selection of our current titles. More photos later: we will bring our Snowday photodiary to you as it happens! 

Enjoy the lovely snow x

Unlike the foxes that lived on the railway tracks where I grew up in South London, which were skinny, ratty beasts, these North London Reynards are fine-looking animals, as evidenced by this rather shaky pic I snapped over breakfast a few weeks back:

<img alt=""fox.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/fox.jpg"" width=""400""  />

There are at least three of them, perhaps four, and they live in the dense undergrowth at the end of the garden. They're pretty bold too - we see them most mornings at breakfast and the occasional evening - and we hear them most mornings at about 5am. If you've ever heard foxes doing what they do at five in the morning, it is one of the most unpleasant, blood-curdling noises imaginable (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox#Vocalization"">see here</a>). Ah well.

I imagine they're pretty chilly today, as it's all rather white out there.

Above is one of the final conveyor belts, where completed books are stacked and packed ready to be sent out.

I don't know. The smallest thing can turn a person. I used to be all 'oh, the monarchy, meh,' but a quick curtsey, a small handshake and here I am all starry eyed about the queen. 

So I've just got back from the, you know, palace, where I met and shook hands (no gloves) with the queen, princess Anne, Camilla, the countess of Wessex, and the duchess of Gloucester. And they were all jolly nice. Princess Anne said 'ooh, publishing. Cut-throat. Cut-throat business.' The queen said 'oh, publishing, very good' (or something, I was too starry eyed. She looks amazing for 81, and managed to be interested even after 200 people. Luckily I was one of the early ones.)

And then there was meeting sirs, and royal staff, and equerries and the like, and tiny canapes filled with Royal-grade Nutella, and champagne, and general this is the life stuff until 3pm, when we all went off to the pub to hoot about how we had got away with the Greatest Wheeze Ever which was to be invited to the Palace to meet the queen when we're just a bunch of lasses trying to make a little difference in our own ways. 

It 
Was
Grand. 

I hope we don't get sent to the Tower, though, because only the queen is allowed to have her photo taken where Hazel and I stood (above). Oops. The nice man with the dog was quite understanding, though.","","","","","2007-02-14","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

Here is a post combining two of the requests - how we manage with a sales force of one and whether sales reps are a necessity or not. More posts will follow about the other requested areas soon. 

To set the scene: Snowbooks doesn't have a sales force. In the beginning that wasn't through lack of trying. Back in 2003 I tried hard to interest companies like Derek Searle, and publishers who offered a third-party deal, in our little fledgling company. I promised 10 publications and sales of &pound;150,000 a year. People couldn't have been keener to run a mile - and, as I recall, were bloody patronising. 

So like all small business we did what we thought best to survive.","I thought back to my days as a buyer at Superdrug and B&Q (oh what a murky past I have) and wrote a list of all the things I wished my suppliers had done to make my life easier. All I had wanted, back at B&Q, was to look good in my boss' eyes. It was a vicious environment and management had to believe I was doing a good job - and I needed my suppliers to help me to convince them. I was working 16 hours a day, easily, and weekends too - and to save precious hours I wanted suppliers to stop pestering me for meetings - what would we say in a meeting that we couldn't say on the phone? They just wanted to tell their bosses that they'd 'had a meeting with B&Q'. I wanted them to stop bullshitting about how their product was going to revolutionise hardwood floor cleaning as we knew it, or whatever, and just give me a realistic and accurate forecast of what it was going to sell. I wanted them to promise to fill in the new product forms correctly - once the details were keyed into SAP it took about a month to correct any mistakes. I wanted them to just agree with me that they were going to have to sell their products to me at just above cost, rather than dragging out the inevitable. There were plenty of other, say, bin-bag suppliers out there and it was a buyers' market - and we were B&Q, for god's sake, we could sell a million binbags in a week if we wanted, so they were still going to get rich. And so on - basically, I wanted them to support me. 

So Gilly and I sat and wrote this list of all the things a supplier could do for a buyer, and then we wrote an information pack laying out all of this stuff. We included realistic forecasts, and all the bibliographic data, nicely formatted. We wrote about the target market and the research we'd done to make sure the book was a safe bet. We promised to give the buyers as much margin as we could possibly afford without actually losing money - if they felt our books were profitable we would be good suppliers. We promised good supply chain service levels - sale or return, short lead times, correct pallet ti-hi's, all the usual. We looked up what their strategic objectives were - all public domain stuff on the net, but it was a job and a half to track down various presentations and press releases - and made sure that our books were going to help them achieve their goals. We printed it out on nice card - about 30 pages of A5 - put it in a nice frosted binder... and posted it off. 

And waited. 

For a day. Then (lovely, precious) Susie Doore emailed from Waterstone's and invited us in for a meeting. Her and (lovely, precious) Scott* who was then there too put our first three books on 3 for 2 - one of which utterly tanked (I must do a blog post about that, entitled 'How we made every mistake possible when we published a particular book one time but at least we never made any of those mistakes again'), one of which did ok and one of which went on to sell 50,000 copies. We were on the way. 

So that is the story of how we got going. As you grow a business, though, you start to think about how you can improve processes, and whether you need to take on more resource to do so. One of the areas we've thought about is sales reps. There is no doubt that a good team would increase subs - it stands to reason, as there would be more people out there selling books in. Our queries are around sell*through*, though. 

Say a buyer buys 1500 units of a book from me and (kindly) puts it on 3 for 2. A stack of 10 or so books find their way onto the front of store tables. Hopefully each store will sell at least 8 of those - because the cover is compelling, we've got some good quotes on the back, an interesting blurb and so on. The odd person might buy it because of a good review, too. 

What if a sales rep sells in those same 10 books to a store? There are the same number of books sitting on the table - will that make readers buy an extra 2 copies? Readers don't know whether a sales team sold them in, or just me. All else being equal, I don't quite see what difference a sales rep makes - aside from taking a healthy cut of our turnover. I can imagine, however, a sales rep oversubbing a book which then suffers from higher returns - or languishes in store, making us look bad when someone from head office looks at the stock balance.  

I would have a sales force if it meant making life easier for my customers - but I don't think it does. Very few indies see reps any more; the large retailers buy centrally. I suppose at heart I don't like the inefficiency of it either - sending 10 people out to have 10 conversations about the same thing, when one conversation with a central buyer would achieve the same goal. 

So - have I answered the question? (I'm doing an Open University degree at the moment so I ask myself that a lot.)  We get by on a sales force of 1 by making sure our bibliographic data is timely and correct, and by trying to do what retailers want us to do. Would we sell more books if we had a rep force? Probably, but we'd also risk higher returns. And would ceding control over such an important area of the business be a good idea? 

* I was once explaining to Rob who the important people in bookselling were. I refered to one buying controller as 'the Scott Pack of [insert retailer name]'. Rob asked who Scott Pack was. I replied 'He's the Scott Pack of Waterstone's.' I am funny.","","","","2007-02-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","6"

Well, her real name is Jemima, which became Mimey, which became Moo, or Mookie Moo, which becomes on occasion Mickety Mimey Moo the Moo Cat. You know how it goes... 

She is very dear, and sings very high. Her prize trick is to whoosh into the room, yell 'wheee', and fall over onto her side to play dead. Then you have to tickle her, at which she rolls onto her back, legs waving in the air. 

And this is her sister, Amber. Good name for a black cat, no? 

<img alt=""amber.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/amber.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""267"" />

Moo is constant; Amber is flighty. I had to miss the London Book Fair in 2003 - just when we were thinking about starting Snowbooks - because Amber went missing for 3 days. I didn't sleep; Andy did an excellent job of putting up posters. A nice French man found her collar and phoned us; we went round to his area, yelled for her and a pitiful mew came from under an old mattress in a disused garage. She struggled over to see us - weak with hunger because cats can't look after themselves in the wild - and let me carry her all the way home. Little poppety lamb. And that is how I remember which month the London Book Fair is in. 

In this photo she looks very plush, and goes well with the cushion. Good cat. And to think: if my little cat hadn't patiently waited to be found, and if we hadn't found her, I don't think I would have started Snowbooks. I wouldn't have had that sense of optimism and drive and excitement that got us started - it would have been a time of such sadness and I don't think you can have cheerful optimism if you're sad.

And, to end this profile, here is Moo's nose. Normal service will resume soon.

There's no way to predict whether a book will do well or not. You'll end up with a warehouse full of stock. What's the easiest way to make a million pounds in publishing? Start with two million, har har. 

And so on. Just a small sample of some of the oh-so-useful advice we got when we started talking to people about starting Snowbooks. People are very good at giving advice based on their own experiences, without taking a moment to consider the experiences and capabilities of those they're advising. If I was starting out again, here's the advice I would have benefited from. 

It's a good idea to understand your angle, and be happy to exploit it. I don't mean an editorial angle - more the point of reference from which you're approaching publishing. Rob and I, for instance, understand multiple retailing very clearly. We use that to help us create books that retailers will do well with. Other publishers use their journalistic background to great effect - Short Books, for example. Picadilly Press use the teaching expertise of their founder to fill a gap in the market. If you're a bookseller, use your bookselling expertise to inform your editorial strategy. If you're an accountant, use your financial management abilities to run a tight ship. Your past is your best asset!","","","","","2007-02-25","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

I don't want to seem ungrateful, since Em is so marvellous at getting positive press coverage for Snowbooks, but I did ask to be referred to as ""Rob Jones, Snowbooks' shadowy Chairman"" and as yet, no one has picked up on the 'shadowy' part. I suppose I should be grateful if they get the 'Jones' or the 'Snowbooks' bit right.

Now, in a rather hamfisted segue, that leads me on to mentioning something else about the whole business of passing on accurate information. Since it concerns what you might call 'strategy' and uses words like 'supply chain', I'll hide it behind the 'Continue reading' link to avoid upsetting anyone just here for the cat photos. So read on... if you dare.","Phew, that's got rid of all those squares who just don't 'get' how much fun strategy can be.

So, the supply chain.... I want to talk about how the price you pay for something in a shop depends on different bits of that chain. Now, as you'll probably be aware, if you buy a book, someone somewhere will have had to print it, someone else will have written it, somebody may even have had to cut down a recycled tree to make the paper. If you think about it, each of those people will need to pass on their costs to the next person in the chain as the book makes its way from being a plant to being to being an awkward lump in your shopping bag. The reason for that is simple: anyone who isn't covering their costs will soon have to go bust and move back in with their parents. So let's assume everyone charges the next person in the chain enough to cover their expenses, plus some unspecified profit margin. That means the price you pay when you buy a book is the total cost of getting it into your hands, plus the total of all the profit margins along the way. Here, to make your life easier, is a slightly confusing diagram to 'illustrate' that point.

<img alt=""supply-chain-info1.gif"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/supply-chain-info1.gif"" width=""455"" height=""188"" />

Now, obviously each person involved would like to make the block that represents their profit margin a little bit bigger. One way to do that is to bump up the price the consumer pays, then there's more money to go round. At least there's more to go round on each sale, but basic economics reminds us that putting up the cost might reduce the number of units sold. Clearly you don't want to get 10% more profit on each sale, but only half the number of sales. Or worse still a zillion times more profit on zero sales. So often the price to the consumer is left where it is (or even reduced) and everyone spends a lot of time elbowing everyone else for a bigger slice of a fixed-size profit pie. And if one supply-chain player manages to grab a bigger slice of that pie, it must come out of someone else's slice because the size of the pie stays the same. And being made entirely of profit, that's a very tasty pie we're talking about.

Of course, as well as the profit blocks, that diagram also has cost blocks. If you can make your cost block smaller, and get away with charging the same price, then you'll make more profit. But it's best to do that in secret, because the other supply-chain players will squeeze you harder if they know your costs have gone down. Why? Because supply-chain partners generally treat each other like pit ponies: they want those partners to carry the heaviest burden possible without keeling over dead. Anyone showing plumper profit margins clearly needs to be worked a bit harder. 
<img alt=""pony.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/pony.jpg"" width=""135"" height=""107"" align=""right"" style=""margin: 10px 0px 10px 25px;"" />

Now, in this game of squeezy-profit-death, it helps to be big and it also helps if your supply-chain partners are numerous and small. Being big helps you win games of brinkmanship that are such a refreshing and enjoyable part of supply-chain negotiations. Imagine you're a big retailer dealing with a small supplier (but it works the other way round too). The supplier accounts for 1% of your spending. You account for 85% of theirs. You can stand to lose them; they might go under if they lose you. And if there are half a dozen other suppliers lined up ready to take their place, that makes your position even stronger. It makes the consequences of squeezing just a bit too hard much easier to bear - for you, that is; obviously it's a bit more permanent for them.

Now, just in case anyone is still reading, I'll briefly mention something much more interesting than the supply chain and that's 'heaven'. Oh yes, apparently it's a marvellous place. And maybe you recall the Buddhist idea that in heaven there's food a'plenty but the chopsticks are too long for anyone to eat with. (Not sure why you can't use your hands. Maybe you get a slap round the head from god if you do.) The enlightened point being that if everyone feeds someone else then all is well. So why is that relevant? Well (and you have to picture me saying this in a Rowan Atkinson, Anglican-vicar-trying-to-be-modern-and-relevant voice) you see, the supply chain is a little like heaven. There is an equivalent to the ten-foot-long chopsticks of the parable and it's information. There are certain sorts of information that you can't use yourself, but you can feed to your supply-chain neighbour - information that they will find delicious and useful.
<img alt=""chopsticks.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/chopsticks.jpg"" width=""96"" height=""52"" align=""left"" style=""margin: 10px 25px 10px 0px;""/>

Leaving heaven aside for a minute, what I'm talking about is a kind of information that you can share with your supply-chain partners to help them lower their costs. The catch is that it won't lower your own. And does this information sharing take place? Unfortunately in the adversarial atmosphere of squeezy-profit-death, it tends not to.

And it really is a pity that this information isn't shared because the effects it can have are a little bit magical. Simply sharing information can allow the total amount of profit made in the supply chain to go up - and it doesn't involve charging the customer any more. How, you ask, is this possible?

Well the answer is that business is a risky endeavour and most sane firms spend some of their hard-earned money on trying to mitigate that risk. Buying insurance is an obvious example. In a typical argey-bargey-riddled supply chain, most companies are also lowering their risks by keeping reserves of both cash and stock. Uncertainty about when the next order will come in and how big it will be forces companies to hold 'buffer' stock, just on the off-chance. Uncertainty about when they'll be paid or whether they'll suddenly have to manufacture more product (because of an unexpected order), well that forces them to hold bigger cash reserves. Both of these things are expensive. In the publishing world it means printing more books than you think you need - just in case. And keeping money to one side rather than putting it to work - again, just in case.

Now you can't eliminate this sort of risk completely (short of developing scary mind powers) but if you know more about what's going on further down the supply chain (i.e. down at the customer end) then you don't need as much buffer stock or as big a cash reserve - and that saves you money. But if you're a publisher, it's difficult to know what the customer is up to: that's information only the retailer possesses. And even if you pay a company like Nielsen for info about customer sales, you would still need to know what's in the retailer's mind. Nielsen can't tell you that the retailer is about to have a purge on inventory and ship back half your unsold books.

And that's something the retailers don't always seem cognizant of. When they dump stock in your lap or put in a large, last-minute order they're not just making waves in the short-term, they're sending a message that this sort of thing might happen again, so you might want to think about increasing cash and stock reserves permanently. To sloganise that for you: uncertainty is the enemy of efficiency. Or to throw in a little metaphor: inability to forecast the future is the slug to the lettuce of business efficiency. And that slug is partly under the control of one's downstream supply-chain partners.
<img alt=""slug.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/slug.jpg"" width=""124"" height=""93"" align=""right"" style=""margin: 10px 0px 10px 25px;""/>

Which is not to say publishers should be shaking their fists at retailers while patting themselves on the back for their own virtuousness. Firstly, it's too easy to dislocate a shoulder doing that and secondly publishers are even bigger offenders. Every time we visit a printers and ask them how they work, 90% of what we hear concerns how the printers deal with last-minute, panic orders from publishers who send them mistake-laden files in the wrong format last thing on a Friday and want their order printed overnight - despite the book having been in the pipeline for ten months.

The point - if there is a point - is that squeezing your supply-chain partners on price and then changing your plans at the last minute is counter-productive. You're demanding a lower price from someone while driving their costs up. If you want your partners to lower their prices, then increase their ability to predict what you'll do next and then ask them to share the benefits with you. It's healthier for the supply chain and it promotes integration and efficiency. Counter-intuitively, if everyone behaves predictably it can actually increase the supply-chain's ability to cope with the unpredictable. That happens because in a happy and healthy supply-chain, information gets passed quickly from the customer end of the chain all the way back up to the top. That way, printers are getting ready for orders that haven't been placed yet because publishers have told them that the retailers have noticed that the customers are behaving differently. The whole chain starts reacting immediately as soon as any part of it recognises a problem.

And even if that sort of collaboration never comes to pass, it's worth understanding that to make a last minute change or to rely on rush orders is <em>actually the same thing</em> as asking for a price reduction because it forces your suppliers to spend more on risk-mitigation and excess capacity. And to return to the Buddhist parable, that's a little bit like deciding to feed your neighbour with your ten-foot chopsticks but not warning them first. In supply-chain terms, you could have someone's eye out like that.","","","","2007-03-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Estate agents, literary agents, newsagents. Wait, no, not newsagents. In fact look for a future post about how Snowbooks' secret weapon is one particular newsagent. But those others...  We don't have a problem with <em>all</em> middlemen, but if you sit between the producer of something and the consumer of something and you don't retail it or distribute or warehouse it - well you'd better make sure you do <em>something </em>for your share of the proceeds. And you also better make sure that your share is in proportion to what you add not what you can get away with.","I mention this for two reasons. One is - and historically people react badly to this statement - publishers are just middlemen too. We don't <em>do </em>anything, we just sort of coordinate activity, stump up a bit of cash and contribute some marketing. So we have no guaranteed place in the future of the book world. I know! A world with books but no publishers; it seems impossible. But it's a good reason not to get smug. Without us, there'd still be authors, printers, distributors, retailers, cover designers, proofreaders - oh, and readers - there'd just be no one to tell them all to do it. And saying 'Go!' is clearly not a proper job description. No, we need to 'continually reinvent ourselves' and 'look for ways to add value' and all those other bleurgh-making terms for good ideas. Plus I'd have to say most of the publishers we know aren't about to get complacent. We're not successful enough for that. But for a cautionary tale on what happens when the middlemen get too full of themselves read <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0,,2025767,00.html"">Guardian Unlimited: The Fat-Cat Jukebox</a>. The music industry is ripe for a shake-up and they've done it to themselves. If they're not careful, they'll get 'disintermediated' and all that will be left is musicmakers and music-lovers and a big not-for-profit website that sits between the two, matching up tastes with tunes, and the world will be the better for it.


*Disintermediated is a jargon word I <em>do</em> like. In case you weren't huffing venture capital and turning your business into an e-business in the late Nineties, you might not know the term. It means 'to cut out the middleman'.","","","","2007-03-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Here's a phenomenon I've been meaning to share with you. We run an open submissions policy, right, whereby anyone can submit their manuscript to us. We have a few rules to make it more manageable for us: email submissions only, first three chapters in the first instance, that manner of thing. We read through the pages, and if we like what we see we ask for the rest. Simple, huh? 

Simple, yes. Fraught with pitfalls, also. When I read something I like, I email the author and say so, and ask for more. I've said that I really enjoyed their writing, and could I see some more. I've said that their writing is compelling and of an excellent quality, and could I see some more. I've said I've been captivated, and could I see some more. The thing is, I'm not sure that I should have said these things. 

Problem is, the nature of writing is that you're baring your soul. Comments don't get taken at face value; they have to be analysed, dissected, put under the microscope. In some cases what has happened is we read the full ms, and have decided against making an offer for it, for all manner of reasons - sometimes because it doesn't fit with our direction, sometimes because although we can see its merit, we just don't quite love it enough to take it on. It's a very subjective thing. Then when we reject their manuscript, some authors have been upset: the initial positive comments have been taken as more than just that and authors have a perception that there has been an about-face.

Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa: I have raised your expectations. If I'd received an email saying 'I like your stuff' I would be disappointed if then it came to nothing. But it is geuninely difficult. The thing is, should I lie? I don't like having to lie. I don't like having to 'manage' people - I just want to be open and honest. I guess what I have to do is remain as neutral as I can - ask for the rest of the script but avoid mentioning why, or to what degree I liked it. 

I really feel bad for raising author's expectations only to decide against publishing it once we've read the whole book. But I also feel sad that I can't express joy about reading a manuscript. Any suggestions?","","","","","2007-03-05","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

(We have a picture of tulips, by the way, because it's all springy today, courtesy of the flowers in Kogan Page's reception today. Isn't my camera great?) 

""From the moment I first read about Snowbooks in a magazine feature, I followed its progress with passionate interest and admiration so, as a freelance journalist hoping to move into publishing, I was thrilled to be given the chance to join them for remote work experience.","Since starting in January, I have proofed several novels; I instinctively thought I would enjoy it but I love it so much I've even surprised myself. I have also written press releases, worked on a grant application and looked through manuscript submissions sent to Snowbooks.

Working remotely has been fantastic. It is a brilliant opportunity that has allowed me to fit really great, hands-on and plentiful experience around my current commitments so I work in the evenings, at weekends and on days when I don't have any freelance work.

I really like Snowbooks' project management approach, which gives great variety and satisfaction, and it is a big advantage for me to gain experience in different areas of the publishing process.

I am really enjoying this opportunity and I can only thank Emma, Gilly and the rest of the team for taking me on.""","","","","2007-03-09","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

So Rob's comment in the last post about me practising my choke-holds might have confused some readers who don't know that I train in the deadly art of... er, martial arts. Which is why you can see me in the picture above delivering a rather fine left jab to a girl.

Boxing, kickboxing and JKD (Jeet Kune do) are just the best thing for unwinding after a day's work. Training affords a part of the day utterly devoid from thoughts of returns, sales, critical paths and cashflow: there's no time to think when someone's trying to hit you in the head. I thoroughly recommend it as a complete cure-all. The only thing it's not very good for is self-defence. I soon realised my capabilities only go so far, and if I was attacked by anyone much bigger than me I'd get hurt for sure. At least now I'm fit enough to run away! 

I train at the <a href=""http://www.bobbreen.co.uk/"">Bob Breen academy</a>. Do drop by if you're in Hoxton Square of an evening - it's a lovely gym, a lovely atmosphere (no one has any aggression left, or anything left to prove) and very good for your health. Plus you can try to land a punch on me, which you don't get to do every day.","","","","2007-03-09","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

Sure, I could switch on the overhead fluorescents, but they remind me of office jobs gone by so I'd rather be in the dark. Still, I needed to replace the bulb which is one of those stupid fancy mini ones you can only get from IKEA:

I thought you might be interested to see one of the stages of getting a book printed.","Our forthcoming Monster Island is going to look like this (except without the watermark): 

<img alt=""9781905005475.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/9781905005475.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""485"" />

Pretty, no? The title will be picked out in red foil; the author name will be highlighted with shiny varnish (called spot UV) and the title and author will be embossed. But how does the printer know that we want these areas to be so treated? Along with the pdf of the cover art, we send something like this: 

<img alt=""spotuv.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/spotuv.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""281"" />

This one is for Needle in the Blood and shows the areas where we want the printer to put spot uv. We send three files like this: one for the varnish, one for the foil and one for the embossing. (Note that we will have a nice shiny crow - excellent.) We don't always use each of these finishes, but in the spirit of making sure our books sit properly in their genre, we'll almost always use foil and embossing on crime fiction, foil on historical fiction, and spot uv wherever we can. We love it. Spotuvspotuvspotuv. Lovely. 

So to check with the printer that what <em>we</em> mean by a colour is the same as what <em>they</em> mean by a colour (as all output devices - monitors to you - vary) we get a colour-true proof back before the printers press the big red 'print 2000 copies' button. Along with this we get three sheets of see through film, like in the picture at the top of this post. They show where the various finishes are going to be. We use our special clever powers of imagination to check that where there is black there will be red foil, or varnish, and then send it back. And then the postman brings a couple hundred of books in the post a few days later. It is magic.","","","","2007-03-14","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

In those days you could get rich by deciding to do whatever you were already doing <em>but over the Internet</em>. Back then, when you ordered something from Amazon it turned up pretty much the next day. Sometimes much sooner. Or so it seemed. It was amazing. And sometimes there'd be presents thrown in too. I got a free game of Jenga once. And I think someone I know got a pen. It was incredible.","Nowadays, I wait and wait, and my Amazon purchases take forever to turn up. And they send me e-mails recommending other books that relate to interests I don't have (pretty impressive, because I'm interested in 90% of everything). Like the e-mail listing 'other books on Christian Living' that I might be interested in. I can't decide whether they inferred my fondness for Christianity from my purchase of The God Delusion, or from the fact I bought Chris Hedges' book about how the Christian Far Right in America are more or less fascists.Their other new thing is to suggest I might like to buy a book I've already purchased from them, but with a different cover. Intriguing...but no.

Then Em commanded me to buy things from the <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/"">The Book Depository</a>, so I did. And not only did they have what I wanted at a keen price, and not only did it arrive quickly, but they included my favourite bribe - the bribe that Amazon used to send me the whole time until they stopped courting me with trinkets. Yes, my package contained a bookmark.

It might not seem like much, but I use an insane, colossal number of bookmarks. If I stated openly how many books I'm part way through*, someone would probably decide I needed to be locked up. I'll just hint that it's many dozens and hope I'm allowed to remain at large in the community. Whenever I buy a book in a bookstore I try to remember to look for free bookmarks, but surprisingly, three times out of four, places like Waterstone's and Borders have run out (Why? Didn't want to print too many in case books are just a short-lived fad?). So thank you, The Book Depository, for taking me back to the good old days of the Young Person's InterWeb. (Now if you could just use a slightly heavier cardstock, you'd be my most favouritest thing ever.)

Author: ""Hello, I'm an author. Do you publish books?""
Snowbooks: ""No. We don't publish books. Goodbye."" 

Not that sort of lying. No. I mean what, precisely, should we say when we are considering, or rejecting author's work? 

The reason this question comes up is that we have had lots of different conversations with lots of different people about their writing and we are often surprised by the results. Frinstance, we have stopped giving people any sort of feedback whatsoever because more often than not something which we think is constructive criticism is seen as a personal slur. People's writing is so closely bound up with their self that it's hard to untangle the two. I'm not saying that's a bad thing; it just means that there are extra sensititivies to be taken into account. 

Let's say, for a moment, that the relationship between author and publisher shares many of the same characteristics as the relationship between a supplier and a retailer. Let's name them, to make the example come to life. Let's say the author is Robert Finn and the publisher is Snowbooks; the supplier is Innocent Drinks and the retailer is Planet Organic (one of my favourite shops). 

Robert Finn and Innocent Drinks both have a product to sell, which Snowbooks and Planet Organic will then sell on at a mark-up. How does Planet Organic choose Innocent Drinks over an alternative supplier? They assess their value fit, for a start.

She spoke on the subject at a recent publishing conference. Publishing? Climate change? It made me realise that it's a question whose time has well and truly come. By the end of this year, I think this planet will have made up its mind on whether they share Clare's scepticism or not. And whichever side the majority comes down on, it's going to mean huge upheavals.","And how is this important debate being conducted? Well, the other night I watched a professional-looking documentary on Channel 4 entitled, somewhat provocatively, The Great Global Warming Swindle. People aren't to blame for what goes on in the atmosphere - and anyone brave enough to say so is persecuted and pilloried - that's what this program claimed. I listened to a snippet of the Moral Maze on t'wireless where a speaker was saying something similar (minus the fudged science). Then I read the rebuttals of those arguments, which I had to track down on slightly obscure websites.

On one side are a large number of scientists. On the other are traditional energy companies, right wing governments (I include New Labour in that classification), heavy industry, American Evangelicals and Jeremy Clarkson. Increasingly we're being told that climate scientists are perpetrating a scam, assisted by loony lefties, which the richest companies and the mightiest governments are powerless to lay to rest. 

Or maybe most climate scientists simply don't know what they're talking about; it's a mistake not a scam. The doubters can't prove it of course, because they're not climate scientists, but they just have a pretty strong hunch that the boffins are wrong on this one.

Or maybe, <em>maybe</em> there is no consensus and most climate scientists aren't sure there's even a problem. Maybe the <em>problem</em> is simply that reporters aren't very good at counting how many scientists have their hands up.

I like to think of it using this analogy: imagine a consensus of astronomers says that an asteroid is heading towards the Earth. They're still arguing about how big it is and how fast it's moving, stuff like that, but there's near unanimous agreement that it will hit us soon. What do we do about it? Not much. Mainly we take one pro-asteroid advocate and one anti-asteroid advocate and let them argue the matter on TV. And we talk about how shrill some supporters of the astronomers are getting.

If the West can bring down nations and spend a trillion dollars combating terrorism, which kills fewer of its citizens than lightning, then where's the proportionate concern over a threat that could menace ten thousand times as many people? If you're the sort who gets aeriated about sharing the UK with a few tens of thousands of immigrants, you won't much care for a few tens of millions of them. 

So, I don't want to hear any more talk of doubts or reservations or hunches. I want certainty and I want it now. I want thousands of people retrained so they can triple-check the climate models. I want colossal resources deployed to settle this question. I want as much doubt eradicated as the massed efforts of the world's great powers can accomplish. And if human-driven climate change is somehow bunk, I want to know it right now.","","","","2007-03-17","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Today I feel ashamed. Forget the fact that large publishers are cumbersome and unwieldy; forget the fact that we're doing better work than them in many areas;  we're in such a different world to them that it's often irrelevant to compare ourselves. We're a small publisher. Small publishers are known for their nimbleness, agility, lack of bureaucracy, bright thoughts and new thinking. So why do we take 12 months, if not longer, to get a book to market? How come it's not us who had the excellent idea of doing a book for Comic Relief, and getting it done in seven days?","I know the real reason why we take so long to get a book out there, by the way. It's to fit in with everyone else. The wholesalers communicate new books to the retailers months in advance. Magazine journalist deadlines need to take into account the long colour printing lead times. Retailers plan their ranges in advance. We'd be shooting ourselves in the foot if we didn't try to fit in with the work rate the industry has set. 

Good books, for the most part, just take time, too. I've just got <em>Ground Fighting</em> off to print. Taking, selecting, photoshopping and laying out 1000 images, not to mention editing a book, can't be done in a day. Editing and proofreading 400-page novels are hugely time consuming. 

But for topical books there is no excuse for following the dumb traditional model of publishing in hardback, then releasing the paperback 6 months later. Er, no one cares, by then. 

In fashion retail they design an item and cut three different sorts of fabric. They finish a number of each, put them in store, and see which variant sells. As soon as they see which colour is the bestseller, they finish making the items and ship them pronto to all stores. I wonder if there's a similar model to be found for bookselling? 

Maybe we should have a suite of manuscripts lined up just in case the topic they cover happens. Ones for what happens when the world gives up on us, maybe (""Kayaking; The New Commuter Solution""; ""Living With Strangers; How To Accommodate Immigrants From Uninhabitable Countries""; ""Walking To Italy; A Guide For When Your Town Is Overwhelmed By The Sea""). Ones for government scandal (you could write the book and just do a find and replace on the subject's name.) Ones for new diseases. Then get to market as quickly as the newspapers. 

Point is, this industry is lagging behind the real world. In the real world, as soon as something happens, most forms of media are on it immediately - TV, newspapers, magazines, the net - and their treatment of the event becomes part of the story itself. Books are so way outside of that timeframe. At the current time, even if we all switched to ereaders tomorrow, the publishing industry wouldn't have the content ready for five months - it's just not geared up to that way of thinking. There will always be a place for measured, well-written and well-edited content (although god knows the number of books out there that take 18 months to get to market and are <em>still</em> badly edited) but publishing needs to be able to work to all timeframes. And as I say, forget the large publishers - their structure means they don't stand a chance. It's up to the little guys to do it. So we'd better pull our socks up.","","","","2007-03-18","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

Blimes - I don't know what happened there but I have had a phenomenally efficient day. I planned out what I was going to do for the week, and had it all done by 6pm! Go me. 

So as a treat to myself I ticked one of the things off the 'I'm never going to get around to doing this list'. <a href=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/2004-7.jpg"">Here,</a> for your delectation, is a timeline of all the books we've published. It's like a little history of Snowbooks. I like to look at the wide open spaces which signify that we went for months without publishing a single book, and ponder: how the hell did we get this far? I remember [leans on stick, squints into the distance] when we went eight months (Sept 05 - May 06) without receiving a penny in from sales, because we got hit by returns and weren't selling enough to cover the credit notes. How did we get by - with no bank borrowings, overdraft, shareholders or anything? 

I think I will indulge in a little bit of pride, looking back at this. Yey. We made it this far. Yey for us.","","","","","2007-03-19","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

I want to store a big bunch of them in a database and then let users fetch them out, edit them, create new ones, and save them back to the database using a web interface. I'm using JavaServer Faces, writing my code in the Sun Creator environment, and all that side of things is going swimmingly - though I'm only doing it to a proof-of-concept level at the moment. I'll probably use Sun's Application Server to host the thing too, because it makes my life so easy. I'm just starting to think about what the database design should look like and I'm very aware that someone else must have done this first. The couple of Onix-y apps I'm aware of both use FileMaker. But I want to go with something SQL-compliant. I'm using MySQL at the moment, which I'll stick with unless there's a good reason not to. Has someone already got a schema that maps db tables to the Onix message structure? Or heard rumours of such a thing? I'd even be lured into using an XML database (preferably an open-source one) if someone has already got something working with Onix. I mean, ideally I'd also like someone to send me some nice abstraction/interface code that loads a message into a DOM and lets me use XPath and XSL to work on it, but a proven database design would be a good start.

I love this new take on the uber-cheesy motivational poster: more <a href=""http://despair.com/"">here.</a> 

So I've been reflecting on all the numerous mistakes I've made in the last four Snowbooks years (the ones before then are far, far too numerous to count and include selling my soul to the blue-chip devil and thinking that bin liner sales mattered - and getting over-heavy with the f5 key at Superdrug and ordering 24 pallets too many of Superdrug Own Label Disposable Razors. I imagine they're still rusting away in a warehouse in Pontefract even now. My lasting legacy.) It genuinely surprises me that we have got thus far given some of the mistakes I've made, but yey, we have survived. I present to you here a small selection, to act as a beacon, so that you may safely navigate the choppy waters of small businessdom yourself. Or summat.","1) Design by committee. There is a fine line between working together and working by committee. Working together means that you take the best bits of everyone's thinking and, without ego, combine them so that the result is greater than the sum of its parts. That's how we do cover design today <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/o/ASIN/1905005350/ref=s9_asin_image_1/026-1703831-4547639?%5Fencoding=UTF8&pf%5Frd%5Ft=101&pf%5Frd%5Fm=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf%5Frd%5Fp=125824391&pf%5Frd%5Fs=center-2&pf%5Frd%5Fr=0TVTQEYMPE15A9NDE8J1&pf%5Frd%5Fi=468294"">and</a> <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Other-Eden-Sarah-Bryant/dp/1905005113/ref=sr_1_10/026-1703831-4547639?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1174462986&sr=1-10"">it</a> <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Monster-Island-Zombie-David-Wellington/dp/1905005474/ref=sr_1_2/026-1703831-4547639?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1174463024&sr=1-2"">works</a>. Design by committee, however, is when you let the need to achieve consensus become more important than the end result, and you capitulate on what you know is a rubbish design just to avoid an argument. <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dance-Me-Table-Short-Story/dp/0954575903/ref=sr_1_1/026-1703831-4547639?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1174463187&sr=1-1"">Bad. </a>

2) Being sold a story. Hmm. Agents are great an' all, but boy can they talk. I'm a bit (although not much, it has to be said) wiser about filtering out the truth from the patter now, but back in the day I got a bit starry-eyed about a book and over-forecast how well it would do. Truth be told, it was early in our Snowbooks life and I was really flattered to be approached by an agent and 'trusted' with a book. They said they would kindly allow us the opportunity to have this sure-fire bestseller - it was purely an act of generosity - of course they could sell it for a lot more elsewhere but thought they'd take pity on us and give us a leg-up. You can imagine how that all turned out. The incredible thing was that I bought a second book from the same agent! (I really love the author, is the problem.) 

3) I cringe at this one, still. Thinking that, just because I'd just found out about black plate changes, it would be a good idea to print a book, at the same time as the English version, in <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Turpentine-r-muir/dp/0954575970/ref=sr_1_12/026-1703831-4547639?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1174463610&sr=1-12"">Bahasa Indonesian</a>. We didn't sell One Single Copy. I wonder why? 

4) Misrepresenting a book. We published City of the Sun in 2005. We'd just had great success with Adept and we thought publishing was dead simple - just do a cover like The Da Vinci Code and the sales roll in. So we designed City <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/City-Sun-Sarah-Bryant/dp/1905005148/ref=sr_1_4/026-1703831-4547639?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1174463948&sr=1-4"">in the same vein</a>, although as it's a post-apocalyptic romantic thriller set in Russia the cover didn't really reflect the story. It did ok, but not as well as it deserved, so we're going to relaunch it next year with a new cover that better reflects the story. 

I really am so grateful to the authors who worked with us when we were just starting out and finding our feet whilst blundering around like we did. I'll pay them back one day. But phew, that's enough for now. Bit too embarrassing. I might counter this (and boost my ego back up) with some Things We've Done Well. The good thing - and the whole point - about mistakes, of course, is that you learn from them and improve yourself and make sure those mistakes don't happen again. I reckon that just so long as a mistake doesn't put you out of business, you can put them against the Training budget.","","","","2007-03-21","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

Chris, like Em, is one of those people who has packed more than twelve months of experience into each calendar year of his career. He seems to have worked in - and run, for that matter - quite an array of publishing departments and business units, both conventional and futuristic. More impressive still, is that he plainly understood what he was doing in each case (which in my jaundiced view of the world I never take for granted). I hope I'm not putting words into his mouth, but he seems to share two of our many views on business. 1) technology can be freeing; make it do as much of your work as possible and insist it does a good job. 2) terrific processes are just as important for tiny, overstretched businesses as big, complex ones. Naturally we didn't number these talking points, but let's pretend we did and talk about principle number three: 3) It's much more effective to choose one area (e.g. poetry) and go to town on it, than to operate in multiple areas and risk spreading yourself too thin.","Undeniably, Snowbooks spread ourselves thin. And it's something we've always been advised against. Maybe it's as simple as basic economics: the closer you get to having a monopoly, the more profits are available to you - and we've built whatever the opposite of a monopoly is (hopefully not 'a trivial pursuit'). And when you look at how well Salt Publishing has adapted to its environment, you can see that it's now the 1800-pound Mako shark of the poetry world. Wait, that's not quite the right imagery. Let me try again. Let's say Salt is like an olive pitter and Snowbooks is like a stick. You can do a lot more stuff with a stick, but if what you want to do is pit olives, well, you might be wise to leave the stick in the stick drawer. I take Chris's general point to be, build an olive pitter, or a garlic press or a melon baller; don't build a stick.

What's the drawback of the stick approach? Well, each task we try to do takes more effort and gives us less payback. We have a general-purpose approach that isn't especially efficient for any one activity, but it allows us pretty much free rein. When you've got a stick in your hand, there's a wonderful temptation to poke at everything. Moreover if you want to pit an olive but your choice is a <em>garlic press</em> or a stick, I reckon you'd choose the stick (although I might have to empirically check that metaphor to be certain).

To be more specific, Salt are wired into the poetry world in a very impressive way. They know their authors and their audience and the connections between the two. One of the many benefits of that is the ability to sell a lot of their stock directly to the reader. If we could retain our volume, but sell direct, Em and I could buy that gold car we've been hankering after. But that poetry network would be useless to Salt if they suddenly decided to publish a book on choke holds and takedowns - though sensibly, that's a constraint Salt intend to live with.

The argument for specialism makes so much sense that we found ourselves going back over the reasons why we want to be generalists - and there <em>were</em> reasons; we didn't just forget to pick a niche. The downside of not specialising is obvious: you're always the small player, you're often a newbie, you don't have the relevant economies of scale or the key relationships or the previous experience. Most businesses want to shorten that phase of their existence and we've been prolonging it. 

And if we settled on one area, we could add some go faster stripes to the business. For instance, if you want to sell poetry without exclusively relying on book chains, a good place to start is by linking up with the people who teach poetry, but if it's martial arts books you're trying to shift, then you might be better off forming links to dojos and gyms - there's very little useful overlap between the two, but you probably ought to pick one of them.

And what are the upsides of generalism? Well there's the... the useful amounts of... that's to say it's... well, for a start there's... well, you know, it's more fun. 

But maybe it's time to put the fun aside and specialise. We just have to decide what to specialise in. Crafts? Experimental Fiction? Zombie Novels? Who's going to tell Em that she can't publish books about how to kill a man with your elbow any more? And James will have to relinquish the Sex/Drugs/Rock'n'Roll and learn to get his addictive highs from quilting (I'm told it can be done). The problem is that each of our mini-specialisms looks so damn good. I don't see how you could take someone who was doing a great job at one thing and tell them to pursue something else that they have no interest in and are unlikely therefore to excel at. 

So what's the answer? Well, on this particular Sunday morning and with no detailed thought to back it up, I'm wondering about this idea: specialist micro-publishers. Build specialist publishers at the level of an individual, not a whole firm. After all, my understanding is that Chris and Jen created Salt - that's just two people. If we can get the size of a specialist publishing arm down to just over one person - i.e. one person, plus a bit of support from the team - then maybe we can take Chris's advice <em>and</em> still continue to indulge our ridiculously disparate interests.

Of course I'm going to drink a bit more tea and have another think about it. Maybe I'll change my mind. Or maybe I'll tell the others, and they'll hate the idea. That leads me on to another principle we discussed. 4) Changing strategy is much easier than changing infrastructure, which is why so many companies only do the first and not the second. Ooh, now there's an idea.","","","","2007-03-25","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

So whoever's behind the British Summertime Scam, by my reckoning, gets sixteen million quid a year for doing nothing.

"40888","","1","What is an independent publisher?","Publish","true","<img alt=""73346334.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/73346334.jpg"" width=""400""  />

Lordy, <a href=""http://creative.gettyimages.com/source/classes/FrameSet.aspx?&UQR=lhogdo&pk=4&source=front&lightboxView=1&txtSearch=independent&selImageType=7&chkLicensed=on&chkRoyaltyFree=on&chkNLM=on"">Getty</a> is unimaginative. (Try <a href=""http://www.fotolibra.com/"">fotolibra</a> or <a href=""http://istockphoto.com/index.php"">istockphoto</a> instead.) Searching for inspiration for a picture to go with this post, I put 'independent' into its search engine, and what does it come up with? A blinking great eagle and US flag. Pah. Still, the picture stays, just for the eagle. I half-heartedly tried to animate its eye so it follows you around the room, but gave up. Roll on <a href=""http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/photoshopcs3/"">PSCS3</a>. 

Not doing a good job of getting to the point on this post so far, am I? Stick with me (stick with me, stick with me, stick with me, as <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/lint"">The Caterer </a>would say).","So a few things have come up of late which have got me thinking about what, precisely, is an independent publisher - not to mention a small publisher. One of the things that sparked off this thought process was a <a href=""http://dovegreyreader.typepad.com/dovegreyreader_scribbles/2007/03/a_week_of_joy_a.html"">comment </a>the gorgeous DGR made about how nice it is that indies support each other. I wondered whether that's true, and if it is, why? We're all in competition, in theory. 

You only have to look around the room at any <a href=""http://ipg.uk.com/"">IPG</a> meeting to get a sense of just how diverse this sector is. Its membership spans tiny one-man bands and <a href=""http://www.faber.co.uk/"">80 year old relative giants</a>. Independence doesn't have to mean small. Neither does independence mean that there is any consistency across genre. To use the IPG membership as an example, again, publications range from specialist maritime history and spot-welding books to books that go head to head with the massive general fiction houses. Independence does not have to mean 'local', 'young', 'confined to the UK', 'niche', 'small', 'without shareholders' or 'unprofessional'. Yet it can also mean all these things. It's a miracle that the IPG manages to exist at all with such a wide range of interests to meet. 

What else? It doesn't necessarily mean 'struggling'. Last week I found myself, absolutely not to my credit, getting huffy about other independents who are better capitalised, growing more rapidly, and have more literary prizes than us (in fact, <em>any </em>literary prizes would be one up on us. Bah. See, there I go again with my uncharitble and jealous huffiness. I am a witch). I found myself thinking that it wasn't fair - that being a small independent publisher somehow meant undergoing some sort of rite of passage where you have to struggle to stay in business, where you have to sweat about cash flow and fight for every sale. On reflection, of course, that's idiotic and I'm a berk for thinking it. (Berk - people don't say that anymore, do they?)

I have to be truthful - one of the reasons we got off the ground is that the bar was set quite low on certain aspects of independent publishing when we started out. Some publishers were always way ahead of the pack, like Tindal Street, Portobello - oh, you know, loads of publishers - but still, there were enough awful cover designs and strange anti-retailer ranters out there to make us look like an incredibly professional outfit. The bar has really been raised since then by the likes of <a href=""http://www.saltpublishing.com/"">Salt</a>, <a href=""http://oldstreetpublishing.co.uk/"">Old Street</a> and <a href=""http://quercusbooks.co.uk/"">Quercus</a> and I feel that Snowbooks has to try very hard to get near the front of the pack (but then fear is a powerful motivator, and since I found my new osteopath, who has stolen my carefully-hoarded tension which used to keep me going, I need all the sources of vim I can get.) But back in the day we found it easy to be way more professional than even the big publishers. Lots of publishers still have a way to go, but increasingly being small means being even more attuned to what readers and retailers want - and being nimble enough to give it to them. 

It seems to me that to be successful in independent publishing, you have to be conscious of this very wide spectrum of size, competence, performance, and structure, and you have to make sure that you're as near the top of the list as possible in as many ways as possible. I see some independent publishers grouping together to form collectives (and again I get jealous, naturally: being excluded from any party is never good for the ego) and good on them. By combining their strengths they are protecting their interests. Rob was talking about how <a href=""http://www.saltpublishing.com/"">Salt</a> have positioned themselves firmly and brilliantly in the poetry space. I think that Snowbooks does a really good job of listening to retailers and striving to give them what they want. But how to be successful is not the question, here - the question seeks a definition of an independent publisher. I think to try to answer this demonstrates beautifully why the sector is so important and precious - it can't be pinned down. The variety is tremendous. Independent publishers span a whole spectrum of competence, success, innovation, longevity, size, output, age and geographical coverage. It is so exciting to be part of a sector where there is such breadth and such opportunity to continually raise the bar. Yet there is one thing that all independent publishers share, without exception - and I think this extends to independent retailers, too. It's absolute passion and belief in the cause - in the books. No wonder we stick together.","","","","2007-03-26","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Hooray, I've been shortlisted for the new UKYPY Nibbie - the Young Publisher of the Year 2007. Guess which is the best part of that? Clue: anything that makes me not feel old is a good thing. 

I have to meet the judges at the London Book Fair, and say wise things about how wise I am. The winner gets to go to India on a placement for 6 weeks. We could do a competition to get someone in to cover for me at Snowbooks - do the bookkeeping, answer the phone, that manner of thing. What's the worst that could happen? In fact probably I wouldn't be missed in the slightest and everything would carry on as normal. In fact, everything would get *more* efficient because I wasn't around, poking my nose into things and interrupting the whole time. Sigh.

Despite all my going on about how great Snowbooks is, my salary is still only miniscule. Really, really tiny. I still rely on my lovely husband Andy to pay the mortgage and bills and buy all the cat food and clothes. (Human clothes, I mean. Cats don't wear clothes. That would be ridiculous.)","And to make the money he has to go to a bank every day and do the sort of job I used to hate so much (although there is a lot more maths in his). One of the things he does to unwind in the evening is to cook - he is an amazing cook and it's a wonder I'm not 18 stone by now. Until now he's had to make do with a crappy old kitchen with a useless cooker where all the numbers have rubbed off years ago and cupboards that have wonky doors. They were those weird plastic-hessian-like beige doors and all the melanine was manky. I used to scrub it for a couple of hours and you honestly couldn't tell the difference.

So we were very excited when he got a modest bonus this year - it meant we could have a nice new kitchen to replace the one that was curling up at the edges.  So we had it installed last week - last Thursday, it was. We had a lovely new oak floor put down, and a proper kitchen company to install it so we didn't cut corners. 

So what happened last night - after four days of new kitchen bliss? A pipe burst, flooded the kitchen and has ruined the floor and stained the kitchen. It will all have to be ripped out and replaced. 

Now, how do I feel? Ah yes - very ... disappointed.","","","","2007-03-28","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

The Pentonvile Toad is a mythical beast - pictured here for the first time - that preys on those who are weakened by cold and whose abilities to type are therefore hampered. From the Gallic ""Pentonville Eoad"", its preferred habitat is a small office on the Pentonville Road where, coincidentally, a small publisher called Snowbooks resides. It is usually spotted when Emma Barnes is typing her office address into yet another webform and she is either in too much of a rush or her fingers are cold.

Looks so innocent, doesn't it? All hot, and crossed, and with delicious, plump raisins. But beware, friends! This is the hot cross bun of death! 

Yesterday I was Off Work with food poisoning, brought on by a hot cross bun, or two. Or four. I think they were the culprits, anyway. So I laid on my bed, feeling very grotty, hallucinating about various things (it was quite a bad dose of food poisoning) including vaguely thinking that I was lying in the aisle of a Hobbycraft and that I should really get out of the way because someone might run me over in a shopping cart full of felt. Thankfully today I feel much better, aided significantly by the best piece of grilled tuna I have ever had in my life from Pescatori. 

So, in summary, do not eat four dodgy hot crossed buns.","","","","","2007-04-03","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Here's a thing. I went to my local bookshop today - which happens to be Borders - intending to buy two books. I came away without buying either. They weren't out of stock. No. But the editions on offer were just so ugly I couldn't talk myself into paying money for them. The first was Persuasion by that Austen bird. I watched the version on the TV the other night and thought it was so wonderful I decided to re-read the novel. Sally Hawkins was so perfect: not too pretty for her character, totally capable and sensible, but vulnerable and trembly at all the right moments. Rupert whatsit was great too. Sigh.","So here's my first choice if I want to buy the book:
<img alt=""Penguin Version"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/penguin%20persuasion.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""240"" />
I tried, but that painting is too off-putting. With Sally Hawkins in my mind's eye, I couldn't make a picture of a schoolboy with an impossibly long neck, upholstered with a peculiar mono-bosom, into Anne Elliott. It's the least problematic of the covers on offer, but it's not a crowd-pleaser I would say.

Next we have this:
<img alt=""penguin2 persuasion.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/penguin2%20persuasion.jpg"" width=""184"" height=""300"" />
It's even worse seen close up. Check out the eyelashes.

And finally:
<img alt=""Headline Persuasion.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/Headline%20Persuasion.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""240"" />
I think of this one as 'Anne Elliott the Teenage Witch'. It's part of a series of Austen done in pale pinks and mauves, with sprinkles and stars on them. I just have one too many y-chromosomes for this - not to mention I'm about three decades too old.

So that's Austen. The other thing I wanted to do was re-read Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. I really enjoyed this in about 1989 and I wanted to see if it was as good as I remember. Well, it's <em>just</em> as I remember it: at the least the typesetting is. It's that fuzzy, blurry typesetting from twenty years ago and nothing whatsoever has been done to crispen it up. The cover too is just as I remember it. Sometime in the last year or so, Pan Mac must have sent this off to print using the same battered film they've been working with since Margaret Thatcher was P.M. 

It's particularly weird when you look at the re-designed Lee Child or Terry Pratchett books. And check out Misery by Stephen King. It looks like Truman Capote wrote it.

What's going on?

<font color=""blue"">[update:]
Em has very kindly provided me with her copy of Persuasion. It's a Penguin edition from 1992 and it has a very inoffensive painting of cottages by the crashing sea on the front cover. The cover's not beautiful, it's just muted and simple and exactly what I expected to find in a book that's coming up on two hundred years old. I mean, surely no one says to themselves 'I don't know who this Jane Austen person is, but the cover looks unusual and eyecatching; I'll buy it.' You already know what you're getting with most classics, so shouldn't they all have a 'collectables' feel to them? Or at least be unlikely to annoy anyone. 

Anyway, the unbelievable bonus is that Em's copy is the one she used for school, so all the important passages are underlined, all the possible good quotes are identified AND any instances of 'imagery' are clearly labelled. It's going to bring a whole new dimension to Austen. Thanks Em.</font>","","","","2007-04-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

If you're planning to read this post you should probably read that article first so's you know what I'm talking about.","John, if I may call him that, covers a lot of ground - some of it familiar to loyal SnowBlog readers - but towards the end he homes in on one of the questions that you may recall bothers me about publishing. Imagine a world in which the transformation of a manuscript into a book can largely be done with a single click of the mouse. And imagine a world in which electronic-reader-gizmos are cool/practical/cheap/good enough that plenty of people read their books electronically. What's to stop a novel costing a pound - all of which goes to the author - rather than eight or nine pounds - most of which gets shared out to various vested interests? What bothers me is that I can imagine such a world being better for authors, better for readers, but worse for publishers - and I hate the thought that <em>our</em> vested interests might one day cause us to stand in the way of what's best for those we like to claim we look out for: the readers and the authors. Wouldn't more books get read if they cost a pound? I know for a fact that more music would get listened to if albums cost a pound (and bands did their own mixing and mastering) because I'd buy a lot more music. Yes, there still needs to be a mechanism for filtering out the rubbish, but if you were going to design such a mechanism from the ground up, you wouldn't arrive at a modern publishing company. There are other, possibly better ways to filter for quality than the current noisy marketplace of publishers and retailers all yelling to be heard.

And, as the act of publishing becomes logistically easier to achieve, I worry that publishing could become primarily a toll-booth on the road from author to reader. Or viewed another way: instead of being the people who bring author and reader together, we could become chaperones who try to make sure that liaisons only occur under our watchful eye and in a manner that suits us. The easier it becomes for an author to reach her/his audience directly, the greater is the danger of publisher-as-duenna and the larger the toll-booth scenario looms.

John finishes off with a little communist-y nod towards the idea that 'labour' might deserve a bigger share of the profit-pie, and 'capital' a smaller one - not just in the creative arts, but in the wider world (I'm using Karl Marx's terms here, not John Lanchester's). I have to say that my lefty sensibilities lure me in that direction too, though whether fixed-rate 'royalties' are the way to achieve it, I couldn't say. But I'll admit it always bothers me that the ten thousand people who work for a big business have no control over the fruits of their labours, while someone who maybe stumped up some cash before they were born calls all the shots. It bothers me when record companies do better from a record than the artists and when publishers do better from a book than the author. Sure, sometimes publishers 'nurture' authors (whatever that's supposed to mean) and significantly edit their work for the better, but sometimes they don't. Often they don't. In fact you wouldn't have to look far to find authors who think that publishers do the opposite of nurturing. Besides, an author won't receive a bigger royalty cheque because their manuscript needed no editing. So when a book is sold and the money earned is being shared out, sometimes it's easy for publishers to justify their cut and sometimes it's not. A non-fiction book commissioned, designed and assembled by the publisher, particularly one with pictures and graphics, involves a lot of work for a publisher - work akin to authorship. Contrast that with a text-only title which isn't energetically promoted. Proof and typeset, design a cover, assign an ISBN, submit Onix details, etc; That might be a week of a publisher's time compared with a year of the author's to write it. The publisher carries the risk - but in a world of e-readers the risk could be minimal. The publisher filters out the dross - but in a world of dreadful celebrity bios or junky Christmas novelty titles, how perfect is that filter?

If you turn the model round and have the publisher offering 'publishing services' (including financing) to the author you'd end up with a very different allocation of profits. Publisher profit margins would drop (and in a world of e-readers, retailer margins would collapse). In a sense, all publishing would become vanity publishing. But vanity publishing is only vanity if people see a difference between a book and a manuscript. Vanity publishing is based on the idea that any work which appears as a finished and bound volume has made it through some sort of quality filter; it has somehow been approved - and by paying for publication the author somehow cheats the filter. But as the process of turning manuscript into paperback becomes easier and cheaper, doesn't the notion of imprimatur, the idea that a printed volume has someone been approved by critical professionals, doesn't that being to evaporate? At the very least, isn't there a smooth continuum between author-published POD titles and short-print-run publisher-funded works? And in a world of electronic books, might it not be impossible to tell which was which?

In my view, musicians and music-lovers would be better off without 90% of the music industry. Increasingly, it's just lawyers to enforce IP protection and promoters doing deals. On the other hand, I think we're a long way from being able to make movies without a movie industry. If a day comes when readers and authors will be better off without publishers, are we likely to get out of the way? Or will we 'lawyer up' and lobby for longer copyright terms and harsher penalties for anyone 'stealing' from 'us'?","","","","2007-04-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

I've made a few tweaks to the website content today. I haven't touched it for ages, but now that James has gone to the bother of giving it a lick of paint I thought I'd have a spring clean. So there are a couple more FAQs added and a bunch of downloads and a timeline on the Press page. (I may have got all the dates wrong on the timeline - I'll have to check with everyone on Tuesday.) I am also going to improve the Bookseller page for our international customers, but that will be later in the week when I have the right info to hand. 

I'm also slightly grumpy this morning, despite the lovely sun, because I get sales data on a Saturday and this week our sales were minus &pound;2000. That is because of returns from October. October! Honestly. 

Ok, off to cheer myself up by going to see some <a href=""http://www.fleshmob.co.uk/"">zombies</a> now, because that is how normal people spend their Saturdays. More later.","","","","","2007-04-07","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Chris was talking about bookstores and the Internet, and he referred to: ""...gossip, recommendation, eclecticism and relationships. The stuff the internet is rather good at."" That sort of struck me: the Internet being a good place for gossip and relationships. I've thought so for a long while, but how long? When did I stop seeing it as just a big telecommunications network? And how many other people still haven't get their heads around that idea, because the Internet is built from computers, and computers are 'soulless' or 'cold' or, you know, those other things that wary people say about machines?","If you read much evolutionary psychology you'll know that humans can't help thinking that everything has an essence, some inner character that shines through, and which is normally immutable. I wonder how many of us unconsciously ascribe to the Internet an essence. And I wonder if, by consensus, we're seeing it change. People who only saw the computers before, maybe now see the arguments and personalities, the friendships and grudges, the personal stories and the hidden agendas. Blogs and the comments on them have re-decorated corners of the web and made them cosy. Sometimes geography or the people you find yourself in a room with determines who you hang out with, and sometimes you'd prefer it didn't. Would <a href=""http://meandmybigmouth.typepad.com/"">Scott</a> from TFP, <a href=""http://www.saltpublishing.com/blogs/"">Chris</a> from Salt and <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/listarticle.php?type=blogarticle"">Mark</a> from the Book Depository natter about the future of the book store in the offline world? I doubt it - and certainly not in their spare moments - it would have to be some scheduled meeting or seminar. That's to say, it would have to be somewhere formal, like the real world, instead of somewhere informal, like the Internet. So my question: when did the web take its shoes off and get so comfy?","","","","2007-04-09","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Sort of spoiler alert for Dan Rhode's new novel, plus something about robins, below the cut.","I don't want to be a giant big moaning minny the whole time, but when you work all Easter weekend and only manage to read one book over the whole four days it would be quite nice if it didn't gather you up into caring deeply about the main character - and then cruelly crush said character right at the end. And it would be even better if this wasn't the second time it had happened. I'm talking, of course, about Dan Rhode's new book Gold. Timoleon Vieta did the same thing. There's a certain sort of callousness in an author to so wilfully upset his reader. Bah, I say. Bah to Dan Rhodes. 

On a brighter note I have spent the nicest day imaginable in the sun on a photo shoot for our forthcoming City Cycling book. I was given a lovely lunch too. And I saw a robin having a bath in some water. So the world's not all bad, turns out.

Despite being shortlisted for Young Publisher of the year, all of a sudden my skin has gone old. Maybe it's the changing seasons; maybe it's because I don't drink enough water or eat enough brightly-coloured vegetables, but it's looking sufficiently scraggy that yesterday found me in Boots looking at skincare. Being an impoverished small publisher, I was surveying the mass market lines rather than the Patented 3-step Expensive Clinique range or similar, and came across the Olay range.

Now, this took me back because in 1997 I was seconded to Procter and Gamble for a while. I didn't fully appreciate it at the time, but boy, they are a fascinating company, and, as I finally get round to making this post relevant to the publishing industry, taught me some lessons which big publishers would do well to consider.","In publishing, it all comes down to power. The different players in the industry - authors, retailers, publishers, agents, packagers, wholesalers - all have their own interests and agendas, and all want to make sure that they are seen to be important in the overall process. Nothing wrong with that - to defend your position is human nature (she says - I'm currently half way through an essay on the natural and the social for my open uni course. Summary: no such thing as the natural human state. Still, it's true to say that people are self-interested). The ways people defend their position vary, but essentially people try to exert power over other constituents to show that they themselves are the most important. You see it all the time - in interactions between agents and publishers, agents and authors, publishers and retailers, retailers and wholesalers, retailers and authors - everyone, through their actions, aiming to reinforce the idea that they are the most important, because with that importance comes influence and power, and profit and security. 

Now, consider how P&G manage the power struggle between themselves and their customers. In the old days it used to be bully-boy tactics. The retailer would say 'I won't list your new product unless you drop the price by 30%'. The supplier would say 'OK then - I'm going to withhold supply of this other product which makes you a ton of money a year'. And so it would go on. However, when category management was born in the early 90s, suppliers like P&G began to adopt a more subtle approach. 

First, they spend between 5 and 10 years developing a product. They start with broad-based research, asking tens of thousands of people about their experiences with a particular product area. Frinstance, if they're thinking of developing a new shower gel, they ask incredibly detailed questions about what people look for in such a product. I even heard of one piece of research where hundreds of people were invited to take showers and as they were showering questions were fired at them from behind the curtain (I hope) so that real time responses were gathered. From such research came new squeezy-cap developments, as the researchers found that the old flip-top caps on shower gel bottles hurt people's fingers, and ergonomically designed bottles for ease of holding when wet. They take the time to do a thorough job of figuring out what it is that people want - before they know it themselves. 

You can really see how sound this approach is when you shop the Olay range. I was in store looking for something to make my skin look better, and was feeling a bit guilty for not having eaten sufficient vitamins. I was also vaguely worried about getting old. What does the packaging of Olay's moisturiser say? ""Everything your skin needs most to look its best"". The small print backed this claim up convincingly. Blimes - sounds perfect. It addresses exactly my reason for shopping. Wait, what's this? Something about ageing, too? Here's the blurb from their website:

""You love the skin you're in but you're not afraid to admit that sometimes you need a helping hand to keep it looking fabulous as the years go by. You've even wondered about cosmetic surgery. That is why Regenerist's breakthrough technology is just what you need. With its powerful amino complex, the Regenerist skin care range - serum, lotion and creams - is one of the most effective ways to achieve beautiful skin without resorting to chemical peels or laser surgery.""

That, my friends, is the result of five years of focus groups, targetted surveys, basket analysis, test marketing, not to mention the work of some of the world's finest and best-paid scientists. They have understood perfectly their target shopper and have quite simply given her what she most wants. No wonder they are the market leader in every market they sell in. 

Compare that, if you have the heart, to publishing. (I'm talking about the largest publishers here - another post will follow containing my thoughts on branding for indie publishers.) The lightest dusting of research; no appreciation of market assessment techniques; a hit and miss approach. In fiction, publishers might buy manuscripts that broadly fit their editorial direction but it's a passive process. They're not developing product to answer the market's need; they're passively filtering what's created outside of their companies and performing some perfunctory, basic marketing - packaging and sales. They're not taking the time to ask and understand what people enjoy and not enjoy in the reading process. If they did they might realise that people don't like crappy 30 year old typesetting files to be used on modern reprints, like Rob has found with his long search for a decent copy of Persuasion.  They might have found that people really like cloth covered books - which only a fraction of books are covered in nowadays. Who knows what else we would discover if we only took the time to find out? Maybe even that people don't really care that much about the form a good book takes, and feel that pulpy newsprint, smudgy typesetting, garish covers and glue doesn't make for a particularly hallowed product, and actually if it was easy to buy a book without a load of DRM attached for a pretty new gadget they'd be more than happy to shell out. So strongly, in fact, do I feel about this that I might get a banner made and hire a plane to fly round London trailing it behind - the banner would read ""PUBLISHERS! PEOPLE LOVE NEW GADGETS!"" 

Anyway, back to the point. If a supplier creates a product tailored so cleverly that people are very likely to buy it, and has 5 years' worth of market research paperwork to prove it, that supplier is in a very good position to suggest to retailers that they would be chumps if they didn't list it. The retailer, essentially, would be shooting himself in the foot and denying himself certain margin. That is a very different starting point for a negotiation compared to 'oh, this is the best product in the world!"" which is what EVERY publisher's sales manager gives as their pitch for EVERY book. And don't give me all that 'oh, books are special' line. Yes, they are special, but, if we're talking about mass market titles, they're not different. (And actually, as we've often said on this blog, what's so special about newsprint, glue and unimaginative cover design? It's the words that are special, not the form.) They are a thing that people can choose to spend their money on or not. And if we really care about them, if we really think they're a form worth preserving, we should be trying a lot harder to at least catch up with the robust, proven marketing approaches that the likes of P&G were already thinking of as passe by the late 90s.    

So I bought &pound;90 worth of Olay products yesterday. Each tube and pot I came across claimed to do one more thing for my skin that I was convinced I needed. I slathered all of them over my face last night. Guess what? Radiant, gorgeous, soft skin this morning. I am reborn! Decent research; clever marketing; fabulous R&D and a product that delivers what it claims? Imagine if the big publishers worked like that - there'd be a lot less scope for nimble little indies to work their magic.","","","","2007-04-14","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

I was a sixth-former around the time Pres. Reagan was facing down the 'evil empire' of the Soviets by ramping up US spending on the military... to the point where it was doubtful that the combined might of the entire rest of the world could have given the States a bloody nose, never mind the cash-strapped commies. It was a strange global crisis, as global crises go, whereby the main threat seemed to be of nuclear war, but the threat of nuclear war was also somehow our best defence. Neither side could hope to preserve more than a tiny fraction of their populations whether they started the war or went second. Yet somehow being able to destroy each other twenty times over was more of a deterrent than nineteen or eighteen times. From what I can tell, more money was spent on 'defence' during the Cold War than on anything else humans have ever done. Even then our leaders knew that the Soviets weren't especially keen on taking over the world. And they consistently <a href=""http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/LEO306G.html"">fibbed</a> to us when they said the Soviets had more firepower.","One thing they didn't do, though, was ignore the problem. Now can anyone name another global crisis that's threatening us today? Anyone who said 'terrorism' loses a point. (I mean, deaths from tobacco are <a href=""http://www.otago.ac.nz/news/news/2006/26b-01-06_press_release.html"">5700 times higher</a> than deaths from terrorism and yet tobacco still isn't dangerous enough to be a global crisis in most people's eyes.) No, let's try climate change.

So the last two times I've been in bookshops, I've looked at the selection of books on global warming. I was particularly interested to see if there was an accessible but definitive-looking reference on the subject. You know the kind of thing: chunky, lots of pictures - you can find one on almost any subject. Just glancing at my shelf, I can see the Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language sitting there. That's the sort of thing I was looking for on global warming. I know climate-change science is updated constantly, but then so is research on genetics, following the human genome project, but you can still find fabulously illustrated undergrad texts on molecular genetics. For goodness sake, the laidback folks at <a href=""http://www.idler.co.uk/"">The Idler</a> somehow manage to put out a couple of hundred pages of colourful and diligently illustrated confection every few months without once leaving their hammocks. And yet the only visually-interesting, comprehensive round-up of climate change I could find was <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Skeptical-Environmentalist-Bjorn-Lomborg/dp/0521010683/ref=sr_1_1/026-8206781-0484422?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1176715469&sr=1-1"">The Sceptical Environmentalist</a>. That's the book that says 'there are more reasons for optimism than pessimism' and it aims to counter 'the more alarmist accounts favoured by campaign groups and the media'. But of those more alarmist accounts, I could find very little. Just like the only new documentary I've seen on TV about man-made climate change said there wasn't any. (But you can bet your bum that's not what climate scientists are saying.)

<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Climate-Change-Guides-Reference-Titles/dp/1843537117/ref=sr_1_1/026-8206781-0484422?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1176715714&sr=1-1""><img alt=""rough.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/rough.jpg"" width=""120"" height=""199"" align=""left"" style=""margin: 20px 15px 10px 0px;""/></a>
The best book I could find was the <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Climate-Change-Guides-Reference-Titles/dp/1843537117/ref=sr_1_1/026-8206781-0484422?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1176715714&sr=1-1"">The Rough Guide to Climate Change</a>, which was a strange thing. Just the encyclopedic reference I was looking for, but crammed into b-format, with murky monochrome pictures, and orange the only other colour. I'm sure the fine folks at Rough Guide have spent a lot of money extending their brand to include publications other than travel guides, but in my obliviousness to these things, I was still surprised that the closest thing I could find to a colour encyclopedia of climate change was disguised as a portable travel guide. Apologies to the Rough Guide folks (should they read this) because it looks like a great book, but I wish there was a full-colour, A4-ish version of it, with mention of the Rough Guide imprint limited to spines and prelim pages. It's a great imprint, but I think it's overstretched here: 'We were right about backpackers' hostels in Bangkok, now see what we have to say about non-mesocyclonic tornadoes and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation.' There's also the pretty and informative <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Atlas-Climate-Change-Greatest-Challenge/dp/1844073769/ref=sr_1_1/026-8206781-0484422?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1176722179&sr=1-1"">Atlas of Climate Change</a>, but that really is an atlas: most pages are a map of the world with various information overlaid; (IMO) it's not a round-up or an introductory text.

<div style=""width: 125px; float: right; ""><img alt=""bunny.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/bunny.jpg"" width=""107"" height=""125"" style="" margin-left: 9px;""/><p style=""font-size: x-small; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"">Under threat?</p></div>

So where are the rest of the books then? If climate change was a disease, GMTV would never talk about anything else and Heat would be telling us what steps celebs are taking to avoid catching it. If it were a military threat, trillions of dollars would now be committed to combating it and associated legislation aimed at curtailing our civil rights would already be law. If the transformation of TV and print news over the last few decades has taught us anything it's that most people aren't interested in news that's flat, boring and has no pictures.

I hope there are some lustrous and enchanting works coming soon. I hope the dumbed-down staff of Horizon are planning an unassailable and impressive series of climate change documentaries, written with crystalline clarity and unimpeachable research, complete with a definitive companion volume at a keen price. After all, Al Gore can't do everything. American Republicans managed to convince voters he'd claimed to have invented the Internet; they'd have a field-day if he looked like becoming the man who saved the human race. And I'm sure Albert Arnold Gore Jr. can't be the only one capable of assembling some agreeable words and pictures on the subject. Come on chaps (of both genders), let's get publishing. There's a planet to save.","","","","2007-04-16","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

- one very hard presentation / answer session which was the judging for the young publisher of the year thing.

Oh, the question's over,' just like the bit in <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Taking-Plunge-Stacie-Lewis/dp/1905005458/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/203-1732625-6470357?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1176917228&sr=8-1"">Taking the Plunge</a> where Bernie's being proposed to and all she can think is ""Remember this, Bernie!

Phew... as Emma's been telling you, quite a three days. Before I give my personal round-up - and tell you about some other Snowbooks-related stuff from last week which didn't make it in before the fair - here's something fun from one of our authors.

Noah Cicero, whose stunning debut <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Human-War-Noah-Cicero/dp/1905005466/ref=sr_1_1/202-1995931-5877447?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1176977711&sr=8-1""><em>The Human War</em></a> is out on the 7th of June and will blow your socks off, gave a reading at the KGB Bar in New York last week. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Co26FkWiTI"">A video of the event is up on YouTube</a>, and I've embedded it above.

The sound's not great, but it certainly gives a strong impression of the intensity and feeling of Noah's work. He is truly unlike anyone else you will have seen and read - for the good.","","","","","2007-04-19","2013-03-29","","","","","0"

What a lovely day for a spot of strategy. The Book Fair always allows us to get a sense of perspective and having a general chat the day after is both a good time to think about wider issues and a great way of procrastinating before facing the frankly horrendous inbox.

So what did we decide should be our strategic plans for 2007-8?","Not so fast, my pretties. To look forward, first we have to look back. Some fascinating things come from looking at the title p&ls (yes, other publishers, we run a title-level P&L every week, and you should too. This industry is too focused on volume sales. Who cares? Margin is much more important.) Frinstance:

Adept has generated nearly &pound;100,000 margin. Phewfo. (Gross margin as in sales less royalty, discount, print and directly attributable title costs - as opposed to net margin which is gm after overheads. We used Adept's gm to pay for everything for two years).
Our top ten (out of 50 live) titles account for 65% of our total margin. 
Our second best selling line in terms of volume, value and margin is Boxing Fitness. 
We made exactly the same cash gross margin on Living the Good Life as The Crafter's Companion, yet Living has sold only 38% of the volume of Crafters. 
10 books have made more than &pound;10,000 gross profit. 
Our average gross profit per unit is &pound;1.31. 
Our average cost per unit is &pound;1.20. 
Our average sales value per unit is &pound;2.50. 

And so on. All fascinating stuff - to me, at least. I'd love to hear what some of your figures are like, to compare and contrast. 

And so to the future! In 2007 we are publishing 30 titles. We will knock this back a bit in 2008 to around 20-25, to allow us to spend more time on each title - at 30 we're bumping up against the number we can safely sell in volume. Our frontlist categories will be thrillers - crime and horror; general fiction; historical fiction; general non-fiction; crafts; sports; and gift - so if you are an author with an unpublished book in any of these categories, you should think about submitting it! We plan on buying as many books as possible direct from authors and are committed to maintaining our open submissions policy. 

We are going to evolve our project manager approach a little bit in that I will be 100% focused on sales and marketing - both domestic and international - and running the company. I just don't have time to run the company properly as well as working on my own non-fiction list, so I will do the sensible thing and focus on doing a good job of selling, getting our data right, automating even more of the process including digitisation and marketing material creation and making sure our financial position is well-managed. We are well-organised already but having more time to focus on this stuff will make a huge difference, I'm sure. I have quite a few books to manage between now and October, though, so this will be a gradual change. I will have to wheedle at the others to continue my martial arts list for me and bribe them with delicious lunches like the one we had today in Exmouth Market. 

Anna is going to take on an increasingly large number of third-party cover design projects (as will Gilly and James to a slightly lesser degree), because she's very good at it and self-contained projects like those are easily managed from the US. (I am going to stop doing them.) She's also stepped up to take responsibility for US publicity, bless her. 

Our printing strategy is going to evolve to include a POD element. Once our titles have sold through their first print run we are going to use the efficiency of POD to keep our titles in print. It means our cash doesn't have to be tied up in stock, and as POD books are now pretty much indiscernable from litho printed ones, it doesn't affect the reading experience. 

We are going to formalise our environmental, sustainability and corporate social responsibility policies. I want us to be at the cutting edge of sustainable practices and we are going to focus on that quite a lot over the next 12 months. Gilly has been the driving force behind this to date and I imagine she will be Snowbooks' expert, although we are all very keen on supply chain visibility, reducing waste and being as efficient and low-impact as possible. 

So - nothing dramatically different but it's great to have a good chat and see that we're all agreed about our direction. This is only a selection of our plans, and of course we have some bits which are top secret and guaranteed to make us gazillionaires, but if this is interesting and you would like me to tell you more, shout and I'll oblige.","","","","2007-04-19","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","7"

Following our recent adventures at the very real London Book Fair, this weekend Snowbooks is a proud participant in the first and very virtual Second Life Book Fair.

Taking place in <a href=""http://slurl.com/secondlife/Wallaby/148/164/54/?title=Snowbooks%20@SLBF"">the Publishers' Village in Wallaby</a>, the inaugural SLBF includes everything you'd expect at a book fair - publishers stands, seminars, events, meetings and perhaps even a few deals.

If you're not an SL user, but are still interested in what we're up to in there, read the article from this week's Bookseller that appears after the jump...","<strong>From The Bookseller:</strong>

Those who were disappointed that LBF 2007 had to close its doors on Wednesday may like to take up an offer from Vision. The publisher is inviting LBF attendees to a virtual online book fair this weekend.

Vision is hosting the Second Life Book Fair (SLBF) on the 3-D website Second Life from 12 p.m. today (20th April) to 9 p.m. on Sunday (22nd April). Forty publishers have signed up, including Bantam Doubleday Dell, Penguin and UK indie Snowbooks.

Second Life is an online, interactive virtual world that has grown to almost 5.5 million users. Vision joined Second Life in January, opening up an office and store. Five weeks ago it built a publishing village, with other publishers including Summersdale and Arcadia becoming members.

Sheena Dewan, Vision m.d., said: ""The model of the SLBF is more akin to [France's] Salon du Livre, a public exhibition. But deals will get done."" Vision has bought world rights to a guide for Second Life. How To Get a Second Life will be written by ""Madddyyy Schnook"" and will be published through Vision's Fusion Press imprint in autumn 2007.

Schnook is the avatar of Liverpudlian Andy Sullivan, who gave up a 60,000-a-year sales and marketing job to write and publish e-books exclusively through the site. Since starting in January 2006 he has sold more than 100,000 e-books. Dewan added: ""Madddyyy is an established Second
Life brand and we're really excited to bring him into the real world.""

Snowbooks has had a Second Life store for about a year. Publisher James Bridle said: ""It's an excellent way of marketing to people who are interested in reading but perhaps not all that interested in books.""","","","","2007-04-20","2013-03-29","","","","","2"

A variety-pack of opinions for you this morning. The bunny pic is just for larks.","Firstly a comment on the comedy outrage displayed by our fine industry over Waterstone's putting up their rate card. <a href=""http://www.publishingnews.co.uk/pn/pno-news-display.asp?K=e2007041912244434&TAG=&CID=&PGE=&sg9t=24466d8b6b33a3d5c16185d12ff12d2e"">Publishing News</a> reports: 

'INCREASES IN WATERSTONE'S new promotional rate card have prompted strong criticism from publishers this week... ""They're all charging too much - it's a bridge too far, and it means publishers do not have any money left to promote titles elsewhere"". [No money left? Yes, 'cos you spent the rest on stupid advances and shocking inefficiencies, durr brain.]
   Publishers accept that if PoS is prepared by the chains, then that has to be paid for. ""But if it's just money for the space, it's going too far.  [Uh - why? It's their space, and it's bloody valuable. Why should you have it for free? Go out and buy your own prime branded high footfall real estate if you want.] That's the route that WHSmith has gone down. The solution is for retailers to stop being greedy [Splutter!], but they're always looking over their shoulders and seeing what everyone else is charging and the costs keep being ratcheted up. 
    ""I think publishers are disappointed. Waterstone's is supposed to be a range bookseller, but you can't put other titles forward because you don't have the money. If you've paid a lot f or a lead title then you're duty bound [yes, duty bound, I see] to promote it. Waterstone's are charging more, but promoting fewer books.""'

I have got too much to do this morning to go into full rant mode about how outdated our industry is. Suffice to say that when I was at Superdrug in 1996, the rate card for a 3.5 week blip promotion (the 3 ft of space half way down the aisle) was &pound;30,000 and a gondola end promotion for 4 weeks was &pound;70,000. Publishers have no idea. 

Secondly, don't take one of the free blue bags available from a couple of the stands at the Second Life Book Fair this weekend. They blue-screened my laptop, which takes some doing. 

Thirdly, a moan about the territorial pricing of the new Adobe CS3 suite. If I were to buy the software in the UK it will cost &pound;1655 from the Adobe store, &pound;1593 from Amazon.co.uk. If I were to buy the exact same software in the US it would cost &pound;877 ($1759) from Amazon.com. They are taking the proverbial and need to take exchange rates into account unless they really want to incur the wrath of the entire European design community and risk mass-scale piracy. Is my view. 

Right, off to research Indesign CS3's XML capabilities. As you read in my strategy post the other day, I am very keen on automating as much as possible and XML's the way to go. I'm sure to bore you with it quite a lot over the next 12 months so you may as well get used to it. 

(Also, thanks for all the lovely comments! I do like to get them.)","","","","2007-04-21","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

I have been at this XML/InDesign problem <em>all day</em> - no breaks, not even for dinner which was on my lap - and I've only just cracked it, and I'm damned if I'm going to forget how I did it. So, as much for my benefit as yours, this is how to flow repeating XML data into InDesign automatically. Boo-yah! Nailed it! Oh yeah.","OK, so. The XML we're using is ONIX, of course. The InDesign version is CS2. (If this changes in CS3, launched in a couple of days, I'm throwing this computer out of the window.) You will need to prepare two XML / ONIX files - one a single title record, the other the full data set.

<strong>The set up: </strong>

1) Open a new document in InDesign. 
2) Import the single-record ONIX file by going to File/ Import XML and browsing. Don't bother ticking any import options. 
3) Make sure the Structure pane on the left is visible and expand the ONIX message to Product level by clicking on the chevron thing. 
4) Click and drag the T-box image next to ONIXMessage at the top of the tree onto the InDesign document. 
5) Click anywhere on the text and hit ctrl-Y to edit in story editor. The full ONIX record should be there, all tagged up, with the first tag being Header. 
6) Delete all the tags and content down to -product-. Don't delete -product-! 
7) Go through and delete all the tags and records you don't want. Be very careful - you have to make sure the hierarchy remains intact so don't go deleting parent tags and leaving children content behind. Refer to the hierarchy on the Structure pane if you're in any doubt. 
8) Make sure you don't delete the final -/product- tag. 
9) Once you're done, close up any last white spaces and hit ctrl-Y to return to the normal view. 
10) At this point you should create paragraph styles and map tags to styles. That's easy so I won't detail it here. 

<strong>The data import:</strong>

11) Now, select ONIXMessage again in the Structure pane and go to File / Import XML. Browse for your multi-title ONIX file. Make sure 'Show XML import options' is ticked (bottom left of the dialogue box). 
12) Select Merge Content, and 'Clone repeating text elements', 'Only import elements that match', and 'Do not import contents of whitespace only elements'. 
13) Use Autoflow to reveal any overset text. 
14) And just like that you've got (if you now design and set up the paragraph styles for a single AI, or catalogue, or whatever) an updated, ONIX compliant document. Genius. 

I seriously considered (for, like, half a second) charging money for this tutorial because it's taken me so long to figure out how to tag the placeholder text up with multiple-level tags. (If you're having trouble with this, it's because your tagged hierarchy is not the same as your XML hierarchy - follow the steps above and it will be fine.) But I am a nice person who subscribes to the principle of valuable things on the net being free - so take, enjoy, make use of and if this doesn't make sense or if you have no idea why this stuff is useful, you should<a href=""mailto:emma@snowbooks.com""> email </a>me.

Yes, it's more silly-tech news from James. A few weeks ago, a very interesting site launched, describing itself as a YouTube for documents. <a href=""http://scribd.com"">Scribd</a> allows anyone to upload a document in a wide range of formats, which it then converts to web-friendy formats, displays them on the site for anyone to read, and allows people to print, download and even embed them on their own sites - just like YouTube.

Having done some browsing around, there's certainly plenty up there for grabs - you can read everything from <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/19995/Several-Poems-by-Ogden-Nash"">Ogden Nash poems</a>, to <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/4549/Math-cheat-sheet"">maths cheat sheets</a>, to <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/21827/Top-10-Law-Firm-Interview-Questions"">hilarious interview advice</a>, to <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/search/search?query=palahniuk&commit=search"">the complete works of Chuck Palahniuk</a>. <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/explore"">Just jump on in</a> - it's all free!

But wait, should that be a concern? You know how free and easy and webby and techy we are here in the SnowTower, and we like free stuff as much as the next man, woman and fish. But...","Now, that last example, the Palahniuk one (the Nash one too, probably), is an example of blatant copyright infringement - of totally illegal piracy - and over time deals will be struck allowing some rapprochement between publishers and publicists - just as is gradually being hammered out between YouTube, Viacom and the like. What concerns us is free content.

In <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/sfwa/10039.html"">this passionately-argued screed</a>, Howard Hendrix, well-published author and current Vice-President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (the SFWA), takes to task authors who distribute their own work for free, going as far to call them 'scabs', as in ""someone who works for less than union wages or on non-union terms; more broadly, a scab is someone who feathers his own nest and advances his own career by undercutting the efforts of his fellow workers to gain better pay and working conditions for all."" <a href=""http://papersky.livejournal.com/318273.html"">Some disagree</a>.

It's not just obscure or genre writers who are concerned about this; Margaret Atwood raised the same issues during a seminar I attended at the London Book Fair last week. Technology, like it or not, is bringing down not only the actual price of literature, but its percieved value, and we stand to lose a lot of genuinely talented writers if we stop supporting their livelihood.

We don't have an answer. We're pro-internet. We give a lot away for free. Here's the first chapter of Stewart Home's forthcoming <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/memphisunderground/""><em>Memphis Underground </em></a>- already available elsewhere - <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/37054/Memphis-Underground-First-Chapter"">on Scribd</a> (move the little slider at the top to zoom in and make reading a little easier):

Here's hoping that a few more people read the opening chapter, and are intrigued enough to buy the book.

But we're also a publisher - without selling the books, we're not going to be able to publish them, and we're not going to be able to pay the authors to write them, either. After long months and even years of writing, they deserve something for their trouble. Don't they?","","","","2007-04-24","2013-03-29","","","","","0"

Maybe you'll recall me grumbling about Amazon's sloppy attempts to categorise my reading tastes. Read Prof. Dawkins' tirade against religion and you'll find 'other Christian Living' titles recommended to you. Inhale air - while studiously avoiding sporting or celebrity titles - and you'll still find yourself being offered something 'written' by one of the Beckhams. Well, the latest recommendation should win some sort of award. ""<em>As someone who has expressed interest in books by Rob Jones, you might like to know that The Power of Godly Wisdom will be released on 30 April 2007.</em>"" Ah yes, Amazon, I <em>have</em> been somewhat interested in books by Rob Jones, but only the Rob Jones who's me. Certainly not some other Rob Jones who <em>really is</em> keen on Christian Living. Does this mean we need a literary version of equity to make sure there are no duplicate author names?

In Saturday's <em>Guardian</em>, Nicholas Lezard wrote a long piece on 'the counterculture', citing such authors as William S. Burroughs, C&eacute;line, J. G. Ballard, and the Marquis de Sade in his argument that ""Today's counterculture becomes tomorrow's culture: you have to snap it up quickly.""

But who should Lezard pick as the prime example of a contemporary author destined to follow in such footsteps?

""Our current best outsider is Stewart Home, who puts a spoke in the wheels of success not only with his scorn for the conventional niceties of plot and character but also by giving his novels titles like <em>Cunt</em>. Stewart Home is easily the example you reach for first as a contemporary ""alternative"" writer - but he is so observant, so dedicated to his work, so usefully enraged by mainstream ethical considerations, and personally gentlemanly to boot, that he, too, willy-nilly, will end up becoming respectable one day.""

Hey hey, it's bookkeeping day, which means that my desk is clear and dusted, my pens are lined up neatly, and my folders are organised into alphabetical order. Nowt like displacement activities for getting a job done. One of the finest things about having a blog is that you can procrastinate beyond your wildest dreams by blogging away - it feels like you're working but actually you're just blathering away to cyberspace. 

So in a post rather tenuously linked to my working day, I wondered if we could have a quick vote? A lot of the naysayers about ebooks claim that 'you can't read an e-reader in the bath'. I'm interested in knowing how many people do most of their reading in the bath. Me, I prefer the sofa. Less damp, for a start. 

So comments please: do you spend most of your reading hours in the dry, or in the wet?

So the working week starts in a few minutes for Gilly and I when I get off the sofa and leave the house to get the train to Harrogate for the BA conference. I'm really looking forward to it - I went for the first time last year, thinking it would be the usual bland fare, but the seminars and speakers were, for the most part, outstanding and I had a blast. Oh, and we won small publisher of the year, which is bound to put a person in a good mood. 

So Harrogate it is, Sunday to Wednesday morning. Then back to London on the 8.15, to catch the train straight to Norwich for Sarah's lauch of Needle in the Blood. Then back after midnight, to a busy day of important meetings on Thursday with esteemed customers. Then the Society of Bookmen dinner in the evening.

"40927","","1","Going Postal, Post-Virginia Tech","Publish","true","<img src=""http://snowbooks.com/bookimages/thumb9781905005345.jpg"" align=""left"" alt=""Going Postal"" style=""margin: 0 10px 10px 0;"" />What does a publisher do when a book one believes to be deeply important is also suddenly, tragically relevant? We were at the London Book Fair on April 16th when news started to arrive of the shootings at Virginia Tech. Two months before, we had published Mark Ames' <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FGoing-Postal-Murder-Rebellion-America%2Fdp%2F1905005342%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1177927197%26sr%3D8-1&tag=snowbooks-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738"">Going Postal</a><img src=""http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=snowbooks-21&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=2"" width=""1"" height=""1"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"" /></em>, a powerful and polemical look at school and workplace massacres in the US.

A natural reaction is to wish to downplay such a connection, to avoid ghoulishness - or pseud's corner - and to tread carefully in the wake of such an event. But as we quickly saw, Mark's book would not allow such niceties. It's a hard-hitting work, and its message is one that needs to be heard, as proved by the reactions of the media, of ordinary people, and of the critics, in the days and weeks following the shooting.","One of my first meetings after hearing of the shooting was with an Australian publisher of Asian extraction. She commented, almost immediately, how shocked she was that an Asian kid could do such a thing. Yet this is one of the most common misconceptions about such rage massacres, as Mark terms them. There is no profile for rage murderers. <em>Going Postal</em> documents a number of cases involving Asian American kids - including one at the author's own high school, which expelled an Asian American student for bringing a 'hit list' of intended targets to class. It also documents many other cases, and cites Secret Service and FBI reports which have tried, and failed, to explain them as wholly individual actions, unrelated to the pressures surrounding them.

The headlines, too, told the same story: the words 'evil', 'psycho', 'crazy', 'hatred' - even 'racism' - bandied about without any real investigation of a complex situation, or any of the usual caution when approaching a subject which smacks so strongly of mental illness and personal anguish.

When it was first published, <em>The Observer</em> carried <a href=""http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/politicsphilosophyandsociety/0,,1995113,00.html"">a long and somewhat critical review of <em>Going Postal</em></a>, which failed to find in Mark's argument any justification for the acts documented in the book (it also made a false comparison with the Dunblane massacre, which readers of the book will find does not belong in the same discussion as Mark's 'rage massacres'). Readers should form their own opinions as to whether Mark is attempting to justify such killings or simply, as so many others have tried to do, to understand and - crucially - to contextualise them.

We would have liked to see more reviewers engaging with the book, and now we do: hundreds upon hundreds of bloggers have picked up on the story and carried their own reviews and recommendations of the book. <a href=""http://www.abebooks.co.uk/"">Abe Books</a>, the largest online retailer after Amazon, <a href=""http://www.abebooks.com/docs/authors-corner/mark-ames.shtml"">just published a lengthy interview with Mark</a> on their site (and <a href=""http://abebooks.wordpress.com/2007/04/27/interview-with-mark-ames-author-of-going-postal/"">on their blog</a>). <a href=""http://leninology.blogspot.com/2007/04/murderous-smile-mark-ames-on-american.html"">Lenin's Tomb</a>, one of the highest-ranked (and occasionally most controversial) British blogs, <a href=""http://leninology.blogspot.com/2007/04/murderous-smile-mark-ames-on-american.html"">carries a lengthy and excellent review</a>. <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/4/26/14156/4161"">Daily Kos</a>, an extremely popular US political blog, <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/4/26/14156/4161"">also carries a new review</a>.

Mark has written <a href=""http://www.alternet.org/story/50758/"">a follow-up piece for Alternet, directly about the Virginia Tech massacre</a>. In it, he picks apart the mainstream media's reaction to the killings, repeats a number of the case studies and reports cited in the book, and reiterates one of the core insistences of the book: it's not the kids who need to be profiled, but the schools, universities and workplaces.

I urge you to read this book - not only because it delves deeper than any other source into a phenomenon that many see as exemplary of a certain element of American culture, but because it urges us to look harder into all aspects of a media-simplified, politically-spun world. As Mark says in his Alternet article: ""Blaming ""evil"" has worked wonders for President Bush in Iraq, and it's working wonders for Americans in understanding and stopping these massacres."" The reality, as ever, is far more complex, and far more important.","","","","2007-04-30","2013-03-29","","","","","0"

Apologies, but I can't think of any way to make this post relevant to the practice of book publishing (or 'librogenics', as I have just this second decided to call it). Nope. But that shouldn't stop me gushing with gratitude for Jon Stewart, which is what I want to do. 

In case you don't know, he's a comedian and hosts The Daily Show (More4, 8:30pm weekdays) over there in America. He's not a 'real' journalist; he presents a fake news show, played for laughs. Except that somehow he does all the things you want real journalists to do. He asks the questions you wish 'real' journalists would ask. And that's where he gets a lot of his humour from, so you can imagine how liberating it feels. So look, just look at what kind of a rough ride he gives U.S. Sen. John McCain <a href=""http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/player.jhtml?ml_video=85762&ml_collection=&ml_gateway=&ml_gateway_id=&ml_comedian=&ml_runtime=&ml_context=show&ml_origin_url=%2Fshows%2Fthe_daily_show%2Findex.jhtml&ml_playlist=&lnk=&is_large=true"">here</a>.

Boo, I didn't win the young publisher thing. But congrats to Clare C. of <a href=""http://www.thefridayproject.co.uk"">The Friday Project</a> who did. Oh well - at least I don't have a hangover as I had to get up early today to get back to London to go to Norwich to launch Sarah's <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005390.html"">Needle In the Blood</a> - hooray! 

Also, it means I don't have to be away for a month and a half - which was part of the prize. I'm sure it would have been fascinating, but six weeks in India, when I can't usually find a spare five minutes, would have been a bit of a challenge. Plus I start every plane ride believing that it's going to end in a firey fireball of fire, so hooray on that count too. (I suppose it is possible to read all this as 'don't want no stupid award anyway' bad grace, but I prefer to see it as looking on the bright side.)  

Anyway, you should get back to work. Gill and I won't get back from Norwich until gone midnight, so more tomorrow.","","","","","2007-05-02","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

I just got a phone call from a very nice lady at BBC News 24, who said they were looking for one of our authors to come on the channel and discuss a recent news report. Cue one very excited publisher, thinking, most likely, of <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/04/going_postal_postvirginia_tech.html"">Mark Ames</a>.

Alas, the news report in question concerned the general increase in stress in everyday life, and ways to combat it. Naturally, the BBC wished to turn to an authority in the field, and what greater an authority than the peerless Jerome K. Jerome, author of Snowbooks' bestselling anthology <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FIdle-Thoughts-Fellow-Signature-Collection%2Fdp%2F1905005040%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1178118728%26sr%3D8-2&tag=snowbooks-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738"">The Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow</a></em><img src=""http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=snowbooks-21&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=2"" width=""1"" height=""1"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"" />.

Sadly, I was forced to relate that Mr Jerome <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_K._Jerome"">had passed away some time ago</a>, at which the lady expressed her shock and most sincere condolences.

I was, however, able to recommend the services of Tom Hodgkinson, author of the really quite good <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FHow-Be-Idle-Tom-Hodgkinson%2Fdp%2F0141015063%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1178119024%26sr%3D1-1&tag=snowbooks-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738"">How To Be Idle</a></em><img src=""http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=snowbooks-21&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=2"" width=""1"" height=""1"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"" />, friend of Snowbooks, and still very much alive.

Last night we held the launch of Sarah Bower's debut novel Needle in the Blood in the suitably named Hog in Armour pub in Norwich. The turnout was fantastic with over a hundred people crammed into the room. All the copies were snapped up and Sarah was kept tied to her chair, signing the copies whilst being plied with wine.","David and Richard from local shop Kulture Shock were responsible for the whole event and I can't thank them enough for all their hard work.

We also had a few famous authors turn up in support - Sue Fletcher (Eve Green) and Toni Maguire (Don't Tell Mummy).

The evening was brilliant, thanks to everyone who came to support us and thanks to Sarah for being such a star!

On the way out, Emma and I came across a building that had strange writing all over it. Richard, who was kindly dropping us at the station told us that it was a piece of art by a local artist. The words are a poem and the piece is about the transient nature of utopia - the building is set to be demolished soon. A fittingly romantic end to the evening!

Not for the first time I find myself in agreement with <a href=""http://meandmybigmouth.typepad.com/scottpack/2007/02/its_official_ni.html"">Scott Pack</a>. Nick Cohen was searching for an angle for his piece on judging the Blooker, and came out with this charmlessness in the <a href=""http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2073544,00.html"">Observer on Sunday</a>:","""We had the escapades of an American who moves to France, which was Peter Mayle's A Year in Provence redone for a US audience; Breakup Babe; a well-written piece of chick-lit whose author admitted her debt to Bridget Jones's Diary; and Monster Island, a seventh-rate horror novel, which ripped off every zombie movie ever made. (The author's only original touch was pitting his zombies against a fantasy army of assault-rifle-bearing, 14-year-old Somali schoolgirls.)""

Oh, and what about the fact that some people have figured out that if they keep oxygen flowing to their brains they can be a thinking zombie, or that Monster Island's zombies don't roam around saying 'braiiins'? Not original enough for you? 

He concludes: 

""In journalism as in publishing, fine writers and commentators have broken through from the blogs to the mainstream and it is good to see them succeeding. But, dear God, there are too few of them, far too few: tiny islands of talent in a roaring, foam-flecked sea.""

I don't think Nick Cohen has done his homework, or knows much about the zombie genre. Monster Island was written for the web: without promotion or expensive PR it built up a huge online following. A publisher offered to publish it in book form because they could see that it had been critiqued by those that matter - the readers - and had been found to be excellent. I don't mind people offering criticism of our books, but to criticise something that everyone who knows anything about zombies has raved about - just to support a (derivative) angle for his column about, you know, books from the web generally being a bit crap - is nasty and lazy. 

I'm going to stop buying the Observer if it considers such small-minded, defensive writing to be journalism. And I hope zombies eat Nick Cohen's brains.","","","","2007-05-08","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

...if you happen to be a publisher who receives scale out orders from large retailers and need to send them to LBS. Obviously this is a select population, so more details below should you require them.","Seriously, I can't believe what I've just heard. I was on the phone to LBS, our distributor, who casually mentioned in passing that most publishers receive an excel sheet from the retailer containing store-level orders, and then manually type that data into LBS' template. 

MADNESS. 

Ok, here we go. Create a new sheet on LBS's template. Paste the retailer's order into it. Go back to LBS' template and go to the first cell where you need to type in data. Type instead 
=VLOOKUP(F42,Sheet1!F:L,5,FALSE) 
where:
F42 is the cell with the first store code in
Sheet1!F:L is the data with the retailer scale out, and F is the column with store codes in
5 is the number of columns to the right of the column with the store code in. 

Then copy that formula down through all the stores. Delete any that come up #N/A. Then select all the cells you've done a calculation in, right-click and select 'copy', right click and select 'paste special / values'. Then delete Sheet 1 where the original data is. 

And it takes 2 minutes, not two hours. Honestly, if there are publishers out there not using VLOOKUPS for this they should feel very foolish.","","","","2007-05-08","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Have you ever had one of those awkward conversations, where you can see you've upset the person you're talking to and you don't really know why, but you'd still like an answer to the question you asked, but they've gone quiet, so you push them to speak and they say angrily, ""Look, just drop it will you!"" ?

Well, that's how I feel whenever P.M Blair or Pres. Bush are asked a question about how we got to where we are in Iraq. And it's how I'm starting to feel about climate change.","Am I the only one who feels as though we're having the following one-sided conversation with government: ""So we've agreed climate change is real, haven't we? Or are these latest reports wrong? Does anyone credible think they're wrong? And we've agreed climate change is the biggest threat to ever face humanity? The government has accepted that, haven't they? And we have less than a decade to radically transform global industry and personal consumption, right? Did I get that right? So how come it's still just a news story, overshadowed for weeks at a time, by the usual assortment of the big, the little and the totally trivial?"" 

These are the questions I'm sure lots of us want to put to the government here and in the U.S. And I feel like ordinary people are saying, ""Look, we really need an answer on this. Why won't you say something? Does the fact we're not doing anything mean we're not really in huge trouble? Come on talk to me. Are we doomed or not?"" And that's when I like to imagine P.M Blair or Pres. Bush snapping, ""Look, can you just drop it!"". (Though I suppose in P.M. Blair's case, he's more likely to claim he's already answered the question and could we please move on.) It feels like the West is in a bubble where we know the truth but we're still tra-la-ing along as though everthing's under control.

Now it may not look like it, but weirdly, this isn't a rant about how it would be nice if the people in charge of the planet could find a few minutes to update us all on their plans regarding its precarious health. Though that would be nice. It's actually - somewhat tangentially - about e-books. Surprising I know, but it's true.
<img alt=""e-unfolded.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/e-unfolded.jpg"" width=""295"" height=""188"" />

I've listed the pros and cons of e-books on this blog, and I've argued with various book-lovers about the market for such technology. I've also aired my frustrations with those sorts of conversations here; the chief one being the rhetorical cheatiness of claiming that e-books will never <em>completely eradicate</em> paper books and so paper is the winner - as though they're competing over a parking space and there's no room for both. Or the second most frustrating: those people who've never seen the electronic-paper display of a gadget like a Sony Reader, but who confidently conclude that twenty years of research into paper-like displays will have produced something exactly like the now-discarded Palm Pilot they bought in 1998 when they were momentarily swayed by all the hype around the dot.com revolution, and thus they won't like it.

But it struck me a couple of weeks ago that there's one argument that's only ever a footnote or an aside: the fact that e-book readers - once they've been constructed - consume only electricity thereafter, not trees - and that in lady-like sips.

I can only imagine that some time in the next year, a jolt of adrenaline not seen since the discovery of fire will run through the human race and we'll rouse ourselves as though we've all been shaken roughly awake from a deep sleep, and suddenly everyone will be talking about what we can do to protect humanity and avert the crowded schedule of catastrophes now stacking up ahead of us like some Sci-Fi channel re-run of every Hollywood disaster movie ever made.

And in that fervour, where everything is re-examined and questioned, and we all tut about how the advice we get from government about what to turn off and when keeps changing, many of us will notice that bookshops are places crammed with products that were healthy trees a few months before, and each of those books, once bought and read in a few short days, has served their use so quickly as to seem almost disposable. In fact, we might start to see them as simply the packaging words come in, much like hamburger wrappers: a profligate use of materials intended only to last the few moments between purchase and consumption. And if that world materialises, in amongst all the grumbling and shared sacrifice, it may not be a question of whether we prefer paper books, it may not even be a question of whether making new books is harming the environment; it may simply come down to the gaucheness of conspicuous consumption, and people may stop reading new paper books on the train or in a library the way they would avoid smoking a cigarette or wearing mink (and the few who do may scuff them and break their spines and mutter about thrift shops). In a world where Bangladesh and Bangkok are under water, while droughts are killing millions, reading books that look suspiciously like they might be freshly printed could become positively vulgar. Disposable airport blockbusters could go the way of the elephant's foot umbrella-stand and e-readers could be as <em>de rigueur</em> an accessory as a gas-mask holder was 65 years ago.","","","","2007-05-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

<p>I'm sure politics isn't everyone's cup of tea, as we say here in Edwardian Britain, but it's something I think about a lot, so I thought maybe I'd start sharing the occasional snippet of interest that I come across. If your politics are anything like mine, you might even enjoy that - although you're probably living in a commune without Internet access, so good luck to you. And if your politics aren't like mine, I'm going to put this here green 'P' next to the post to warn you off.</p>","<p>So today's story is about American politics - something I follow much more closely than the British scene - probably for the same reason that a lot of people prefer to watch <em>24</em> rather than <em>Time Team</em>. As you may know, one of the many Republican scandals gradually oozing out into the daylight at the moment concerns eight United States Attorneys (USAs) who were fired at the end of last year. USAs prosecute federal cases and are in positions of considerable power, in that they handle matters like, oooh say, instigating prosecutions of fraudulent politicians and deciding whether allegations concerning election irregularities should end up in court. There doesn't seem to be any good reason why any of the eight were fired - in fact a number of very bad reasons have come to light - mainly their reluctance to do the White House's bidding by going easy on Republican politicians, harrassing Democratic politicians and initiating election-related court-cases timed to a Republican agenda. One of the big pushes from the Republicans, come election time, is the claim that lots of people are voting illegally; either they vote when they're not eligible, or they're voting multiple times. To combat this, Republicans have been purging voter lists using a number of criteria: anyone registering from an incorrect address, for instance. One way to establish this is to write them a letter and if they don't respond then conclude they don't actually live there. In the past they've also purged anyone who has a criminal record, or has a similar name to someone with a criminal record. And in certain districts (you can guess for yourselves which ones) they've disallowed the votes of anyone who brings the wrong sort of ID with them on polling day. All this is possible because in several states the commisioner of elections is also a Republican party official. Dirty tactics that skew elections their way, but at least they're being tough on voter fraud. One interesting thing to note, though, is that there's actually no evidence of a voter fraud problem in the U.S. It almost never happens and almost no one has ever been prosecuted for it. But it <em>is</em> a great pretence for tightening or changing rules - often without telling anyone in advance - so that lots of votes can be discarded. And by targeting black and hispanic voters it's easy to make sure most of the votes discarded are for Democrats.</p>
<p>And the fact that no one actually commits voter fraud didn't stop the White House nudging the Department of Justice to get rid of any USAs who weren't cracking down on this non-existent crime. Officially, the eight USAs were dismissed for ill-defined performance-related reasons, but since six of them had superb prosecution rates and had historically received excellent appraisals, it was never a justification that bore close scrutiny. And of course, until the Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives in the mid-term elections last year, there <em>wasn't</em> any close scrutiny. When pushed about their reasons, the White House has fallen back on the notion that U.S. Attorneys are appointed by the President and so he can fire them if he wants to - doesn't need a reason - but I don't think anyone really believes they were fired just to give the President something to do.</p>
<p>Where the story gets a little bizarre, is that one of the fired attorneys is David Iglesias. He was fired for poor performance and the fact that he had a number of long absences from work. What is remarkable about him is that he's the guy the 1992 movie <em>A Few Good Men</em> was based on; he's the Tom Cruise character who wanted the truth, but was firmly told that he most likely couldn't handle the truth. You wouldn't think they'd make Hollywood movies about below-average attorneys, but there you are. Mind you, even if you give him the benefit of the doubt regarding his job performance, there's still the matter of his absences from his post. Except that there's a very good reason he was absent: he was on active duty with the U.S. Naval Reserve. In other words, the government summoned him to serve and then fired him for obeying. And just to be clear, there are laws against firing someone for performing military service.</p>
<p>So if he wasn't fired for being bad at his job, and they're not allowed to fire him for serving in the Navy, why was he <em>really</em> fired? Well, a couple of months before he <em>was</em> fired he got a phone call from a Republican Senator, Pete Domenici, asking him if he was going to make some arrests for voter fraud soon. Iglesias had been pushed on this before and had agreed to look into it despite not seeing much justification. The Republicans had managed to purge many tens of thousands of predominantly Democratic voters, but they wanted some arrests to make their crackdown on voters look legitimate. Domenici didn't say that was why he was calling, he simply asked - utterly improperly - for an update on those cases, and Iglesias said - as he was required to do - that he couldn't really talk about them. The Senator then asked if he thought any of those ongoing cases might result in arrests before November (which was when the midterm elections were to be held). When Iglesias said 'no' the Senator hung up. Not long after, Iglesias was fired.</p>
<p>So who fired him? Well, various subpoenas have been issued to get to the bottom of that, because no one at the Department of Justice seems to be sure - and it's the Department of Justice (DoJ) who administer such things. One DoJ manager says that it was the White House who told the DoJ which attorneys to cut. If so, there would be e-mails to prove it... but one fly in the ointment is that a number of high-ranking White House officials seemingly took it into their heads not to use their work e-mails to communicate with the Department of Justice; they used e-mail addresses belonging to the Republican Party instead - and regrettably all those e-mails have gone missing. No backups. Nothing. Imagine. </p>

<p>Well I say <em>all</em> of those e-mails are missing, but actually investigative journalist Greg Palast has some of them. Apparently some of the e-mails were wrongly addressed; instead of going to the Republican-run domain georgewbush.com they were accidentally addressed to georgewbush.org, which is not run by the Republicans; it's run by some sympathetic people who handed those e-mails over to Mr Palast. And he says they show it was Karl Rove - the political mastermind of the current administration - and his assistant Tim Griffin who drew up the list of attorneys to be fired, in each case replacing them with someone obedient to Republican policy - and in several cases choosing someone dubiously qualified for the job. And, once Rove and Griffin had arranged for Iglesias to be fired, does anyone want to guess who they got to replace him? The answer, which along with the Hollywood movie connection is the reason I thought this story was interesting, is that Tim Griffin - Karl Rove's assistant - arranged for <em>himself</em> to take over from David Iglesias. So if there has been any wrongdoing, he would now be in charge of investigating it. It's so reprehensible it's positively poetic.</p>","","","","2007-05-15","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

They are the greatest.","Andy and I don't have a car, but we really need one, but like many others we don't want to destroy the planet. So we researched it and found Streetcar.co.uk. So on Wednesday I filled out the online form, and one minute later a chap phones to complete my registration. One minute! Like, when did that ever happen in the real world? 

So he takes some details, and then - this is so cool - suddenly we're in a three-way call with the DVLA. The chap asks the DVLA whether I have points and for details of my license - they confirm it's all ok, and then he takes my credit card number, deducts a deposit and we're done! 

He's sent a swipe card in the post. Once I get it, I book online. The way it works is this: they own dedicated parking spaces on loads of streets around London. There is one on White Lion Street, just around the corner from SnowTowers. You swipe the car door and it opens - no key. You rummage in the glove compartment - there's the key - but it doesn't work unless you tap your pin number into the PIN NUMBER THING ON THE DASHBOARD. So modern! And you can book for half an hour at a time, or a week at a time, and they promise 95% availability. 

Oh, I'm in heaven. This was the future I was promised. None of this 'please wait in for a week whilst we fail to deliver your fridge' nonsense. THE FUTURE!","","","","2007-05-17","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

I genuinely need your advice. Stop lurking, lurkers, and pitch in. 

We really want to print all our books on recycled paper - not just FSC because it still requires perfectly healthy trees to be killed. We asked for a quote from our favourite printers. Here are the two quotes for the same number of units:

FSC: &pound;3,648.67
Recycled: &pound;4,974.88

That's a difference of &pound;1326, which is a lot of money, in anyone's book. 

So what would you do if you were me? Go for the not-actually-evil-but-not-ideal FSC? Or shell out for the go-straight-to-heaven-do-not-pass-go recycled? And don't just say 'recycled' without thinking about it. Put yourself in my shoes. Our margins are miniscule; my salary is less than &pound;4000 a year; survival is pretty tough. 

Squeaky clean conscience or slightly less crap margin? Principles or profit? You decide.","","","","","2007-05-17","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","16"

<p>So, two organisations who are confounding me at the moment. First is the BBC and second is the <em>International Group for Electronic Commerce in the Book and Serials Sector</em> or the IGECIBSS for short. No wait, they're not called the IGECIBSS for short; they're called Editeur for short and they're the Onix people.</p>","<p>Two very different organisations; two very similar attitudes to making the most of what they produce. My peeve with the Beeb concerns their attempts to stop people watching Doctor Who. It's what I call Emergency Snooker syndrome. You choose a time slot for a program which each week you then mess up to make way for something with a completely different audience. I'm not a fan of snooker or bowls, but time and time again I've turned on the TV to watch something I <em>do</em> like only to find an especially vital snooker match has taken its place. With Doctor Who, which pretty much must be the BBC's flagship show, they've been changing the time each week, hoping that viewers would miss the start or think it wasn't on. And then to make viewers <em>really</em> think it wasn't on, they actually didn't put it on for a week. It was either that or make Graham Norton, whose show conflicted with Eurovision, wait a week. And I'm sure the viewing public, starved as they've long been of opportunities to see Graham Norton on television, got what they wanted. But for me, this last week, when Who was actually shown in its supposedly regular slot, was the finest of the recent 'gotchas'. My Sky+ box, which will record every episode in a series if I tell it to, failed to record the Doctor because no one in TV Land had updated the magic info that tells it to. Perhaps everyone was too busy getting the info on <em>Home and Away - The Early Years</em> (= not a made-up title) up to date.</p>
<p>Editeur have a much easier job persuading people not to use their main product - the Onix standard. It's not primetime family fun; it's an acronym-riddled techno-fest that needs nothing more than drab presentation and the occasional bit of self-sabotage to preserve its obscurity. Anyone who keeps up with these things, or reads this blog, will know that the Onix standard describes how you should format information about books if you want to electronically exchange that information with other Onix users. To dissuade ordinary publishers from taking an interest, the Editeur website is kept unattractive and difficult to read. To keep hardened techies away, Editeur have to resort to something more underhanded. Firstly, they make the website unavailable whenever possible. And secondly - and this is the really cunning part - they replace the most important document on their site with a bunch of error messages disguised as the missing information. Download the 'schema' for Onix - a 'schema' being the computer-friendly version of the rule book for using Onix - and what you think you're getting is a zip file containing all the important details. But try to open it and you'll be told that the zip file is corrupt. Dig a little deeper and you'll see it's not actually a zip file at all - it's just labelled as one; it's really a bunch of error messages saying 'file not found' and 'The page you are looking for might have been removed'. It's almost enough to make me give up. After all, without the schema, there's not much I can do on the techie side with Onix. But I'm not going to let them beat me. It might be a badly-written, unattractively presented - and currently unavailable - standard, but I'm going to be progressive and forward-thinking about this no matter how inconvenient and frustrating they make it.</p>
<p>Of course if Editeur really wanted to beat me, they'd make the schema available - but only on Saturday nights at 7pm - give or take an hour or two.</p>

<hr/>

<p>P.S. I tend to assume organisations above a certain size don't have feelings. I wouldn't be so blunt in my criticism of Editeur if I thought I might be upsetting an actual person. So just in case a bigwig from Editeur drops by and is offended, let me say that Snowbooks will design you a new website and write some introductory content for you, if you want. Call it &pound;200, so we can eat while we do it.</p>
<p>And if the BBC are offended, I'll gladly write them an episode of Doctor Who. Or, you know, even if they're not offended. 

<hr/>

<p><b>Update:</b> Hurray! Editeur have replaced a file full of error messages with an actual copy of their schema.","","","","2007-05-21","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

From Steve Aylett, author of the peerless <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/lint/""><em>Lint</em></a>, we receive news of a recently-discovered Jeff Lint tribute.

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Paolozzi"">Eduardo Paolozzi</a>, the famous sculptor and artist, was apparently a great fan of Lint's work, taking inspiration from books including <em>Jelly Result</em> and <em>One Less Bastard</em> when creating such iconic works as the British Library's <a href=""http://www.bl.uk/about/stpmap/piazza.html""><em>Newton, after William Blake</em></a>, and the proto-Pop <a href=""http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=11350&searchid=8201""><em>I was a Rich Man's Plaything</em></a>.

However, surely Paolozzi's greatest work is that most derived from Lint's work, and shown above: a representation of The Caterer, Jeff Lint's most baffling creation, in <a href=""http://www.thejoyofshards.co.uk/london/tcr/03.shtml"">his famous mosaics at Tottenham Court Road Station</a>.

So although I try to avoid posting things relating to cute overload, because, you know, this is a professional, grown-up publishers' blog, and you don't come here for <a href=""http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2007/05/its_coitins.html"">fluffy 'tocks</a> or <a href=""http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2007/05/ball_o_ferreeee.html"">spooning ferrets</a>, here is a photo from their site. I like it because although the site owners live in the US, the photo includes a Hackney council tax form. I am getting one of them cages, and a hamster to go with. 

<img alt=""bye_bye_tax_forms_2.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/bye_bye_tax_forms_2.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""436"" />","So today I have updates on what day it is, time management and cars. First up: today is royalties day. I have sat and calculated and checked and calculated and written statements and checked and double-checked and am ready to go. One day, in the future, I will have a big button I press for all this to happen automatically. I've kind of half-written an automatic system which gets me half-way, but doesn't do the obsessive compulsive checking bit. Shame. 

Now, I hate writing cheques as much as the next small publisher, but there is something about writing royalty cheques that makes me go all soft inside. Er, in a good way. It's the essence of what we do: we take the output of someone's time and effort, turn it into a product, sell that product in exchange for folding cash money, and the royalty cheque writing bit is us passing the money back to the author. It is what it's all about. I hope no-one minds if I share the fact that we have generated &pound;35,000 in royalties for our authors in the last period. We have changed the world for the better a little bit. Without us, those authors wouldn't have that money. Go us. 

Next up: time management. I have just written out this post, sharing some brilliant tips on time management, but then the internet connection dropped, I saved this page, it froze and failed to save. So you'll have to wait until I have the patience to type it all out again. When is someone going to invent a user interface device that connects straight into my brain so I don't have to do all this typing? 

Finally, an update on Streetcar. I am in LOVE with this service. So you recall that last time I mentioned it, I had signed up in the least effort-ful (nice English usement structures, there) way. I booked a car to drive a load of stuff to Excel where I spent the weekend at a martial arts show (I should tell you about that, sometime). However, the swipey card that you use to get into the car hadn't arrived. Bah, I thought. Oh well, I thought. So I phoned them up to cancel, and started to explain that the post had let us down. ""No problem, Mrs. Barnes,"" they said. ""Just go to the car, phone us up and we'll UNLOCK IT REMOTELY."" Whaa? They BEAMED open the car. I GOT IN the car. I DROVE off. It IS THE FUTURE and, as Rob said, proof that alien technology does sometimes fall to Earth.  

I had cause to doubt their brilliance about half an hour later, though. It was a really hot day (in a traffic jam on Commercial Road, at least) and whilst I had the blowers on it was still baking. Thankfully it was only two and a half hours later, when I got to Rob's flat to pick up a computer, that he was able to point out to me that there was a perfectly serviceable air conditioning unit all ready to go and cool me down. 

What was that Mark said about me being intelligent?","","","","2007-05-23","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

<a href="" http://decor8.blogspot.com/2007/05/crafters-companion-new-book.html"">Check this out</a>. This is the most recent of many excellent reviews of <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/showbook.php?id=1905005172"">The Crafter's Companion</a>.","Snowbooks' strategy has always been to publish books that we think readers will like enough to buy (simple, huh?) To hedge our bets, we publish both fiction and non-fiction. The idea is that fiction, if it works, works really well: a novel or thriller has the capability of selling 50,000 units if it takes off (which is what happened with Adept). The downside is that if it doesn't start to sell within a few months of being on the shelves and tables, it's very hard to make it sell at all. On the other hand, four-colour non-fiction will probably never reach those heady heights of tens of thousands of units sold in the first year, but it does tend to sell ten units a week, then thirty, then if it's good fifty, then a hundred. Non-fiction burns slowly, but for a long time. 

It's what happened with Boxing Fitness, of which we've now sold 11000 units. No promotion, no fancy price discounting, just a good, useful book, sitting on the shelves, selling modestly and reaping the benefits of that good ol' word of mouth phenomenon. I was sitting at my little stand at the Seni martial arts show all weekend and overheard at least a dozen people point to Boxing Fitness and say 'oh, I've got that. It's a fantastic book,' to their mate. I'm sure sales will rise over the next few weeks as those friends get round to buying themselves a copy. 

And so it is with Crafter's Companion. We did quite well with it over Christmas, but only now is it coming into its own. A steady feed of excellent reviews, and people talking about it on their blogs, and before you know it you've got a quiet, steady bestseller on your hands. None of this ra-ra-ra hype: it sells because it's good. Not only that: it wouldn't have existed without our own editor, Anna, commissioning each chapter, editing the writing, taking the majority of photos and essentially creating the book from scratch. Now that's the sort of publishing I like.","","","","2007-05-24","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"
"40948","","1","Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes","Publish","true","Well it's all go here, I tell you. Guess what? Both Gilly and James are leaving Snowbooks. Both! They are leaving for entirely different reasons but isn't it just typical that their departures should coincide? In fact, they coincide so precisely that they are both leaving on the same day: Friday 1st June. 

[small, choked sob.]

But although it's sad, I am insanely proud of them both and feel a bit like a mother lion watching her cubs growing up. If you see what I mean. I can never do analogy.","You remember that yesterday I remarked on how I like writing royalty cheques: although it means money is flowing out of the business, it is good, healthy money that is going to improve people's lives? Well I feel a little bit like that with Gilly and James. They are leaving the business, which is very sad for me, but it is a healthy sort of departure. They can blog for themselves and tell you whether they agree with this, but for me there is something to feel very proud about in giving people opportunities to try things out, and develop, and grow, and then eventually to outgrow Snowbooks and move on to greater things. 

[sniffle]

I am hugely grateful to the both of them for their dedication and brilliance. And god, I will miss them. Gilly is going to join a company called Youth Media. After hearing me bang on for years about the inherent evilness of large companies her next step is to a company of just 17 people; they don't know how lucky they are. Snowbooks simply wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her hard work and brilliance. James is setting up his own operation, <a href=""http://www.stmlstudio.com"">STML Studio</a>, as well as his own, soon-to-be-revealed publishing enterprise. Take a look to see what outstanding work he has done - and can now do for you! You lucky, lucky people. No one - seriously, no one I have ever met in the publishing industry is as talented, productive and brilliant as James is, and in so many areas. Hire him if you know what's good for your business. 

[sigh]

So, me me me. What will *I* do? Why, harness the power of technology, of course!  We have been steadily automating more and more of the dull parts of the publishing process, and we have got pretty slick at the sales side of things. So me, Rob and Anna are going to continue to automate the automatable stuff, to free up more and more time for the exciting actual-book-publishing-related side of book publishing. Personally, I'm very much looking forward to the idea of being a publisher again, rather than just doing the bookkeeping and finance all the time. 

So don't expect coherent thoughts from me next Friday. I will try to be brave, but will make a note to skip the mascara that day.","","","","2007-05-24","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

I know, it's not publishing. But it is my second wedding anniversary tomorrow (Friday 25th May). There is a link, in a way: without Andy I wouldn't have Snowbooks because my pathetic salary wouldn't even cover the cat food. Or, at least, the cats would be thinner. Also this is a public service announcement: I am having the day off! Repeat, I am having the day off! That means no email, no blogging, no checking sales, no work at all. I am starting to get the cold turkey shakes just thinking about it. 

We got married at Polhawn Fort on the south coast, which is the picture here. It was the best day of my life - although I love being married so much, so I have had some pretty smashing days since. We shall spend the day going for a nice walk and a pleasant lunch somewhere, and maybe go to a nice pub in the afternoon.

Well, not really Buffy - Stacie's best friend from home who flew in especially. What a star. She features in the novel - full marks to anyone who can guess which character. 

It was a great night. Huge thanks to the wonderful Julian and his Pan Bookshop who I left with the washing up, and Anthony who kindly supplied about a year's worth of Mateus Rose. Took me back - and it was, in fact, very refreshing. 

AND - because a particularly interesting lady turned up, Stacie might be on't'telly as a result! Watch this space...","","","","","2007-05-30","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

<p>Just when you think you've eradicated all traces of nationalism/patriotism from your psyche, along comes Doctor Who. Now granted, the readers of this blog are too mature and complex in their tastes to watch early-Saturday-evening family TV. They're probably thrilling to Rigoletto, or penning a wine review; that sort of thing. They might not even know the TV program to which I refer. Most likely they don't even own televisions. On the other hand, among the riff-raff, and others who should know better, it's surprisingly popular.</p>","<p>Now, I'm not a big fan of being a patriot. If you've got principles you'll want to do the right thing, not because your country says so, but because it's 'the right thing'. And if it's wrong you should be against it, regardless of which nation backs it. For who can be proud of a nation's accomplishments without also being ashamed of its sins? (And goodness knows Britain has sinned.) Likewise, playing 'my country's better than yours' in sports, in culture or in wars doesn't appeal to me. If making Esperanto our national language and having Gandhi on our money instead of the Queen made the world a more peaceful place that would suit me fine. Tradition's lovely and all, but there are more important things in the world.</p>
<p>At least that's what the rational bits of my brain think. But I've noticed that something strange happens when I watch a bad episode of Doctor Who (let's, for arguments sake, say something awful involving Daleks in Depression-era Manhattan). Do I switch off? Do I decide to do something more rewarding with my time? No. I think to myself: 'Come on, guys. You can do better than this.' I <em>will</em> the BBC team to stop bumbling around and get a decent script together and then film it with some flair and skill.</p>
<p>And I think what I'm doing is yearning for Britain to be greater than it is. I don't want an empire. I'm ashamed of our nuclear ambitions, our arms industry and our foreign-policy record. (For instance, does anyone reading this know who <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossadegh"">Mohammed Mossedegh</a> is and what we persuaded the U.S. to do to him? And what the Middle East might look like now if we hadn't?) But somehow I still want us to be intellectually great. I want Britain to show what management-consultant-types call 'thought leadership'. And as part of that, I want us to make great drama and export it around the world. In spite of myself, that's what I seem to want.
<br/></p>
<p>And if it ever happened, I wonder what it would do to the British book scene. I hope it wouldn't be all preposterous sums changing hands over movie and TV rights, and everyone scrabbling to write a book that the visual media would want to feed into their hungry movie mill. Because, rather quaintly perhaps, I think of novels as primarily being about storytelling. And I think of movies and TV drama as the same. And I would very much like it if the UK were stronger in all forms of storytelling* - if the UK was to the world, as the BBC used to be to other TV channels. I wish we produced all the really <em>good</em> stuff, the dramas that radiated quality, especially in the mainstream. It seems like a harmless enough dream, and yet it's a slippery slope. Is it too much to hope it won't end up with me shaving my head, wearing a union jack t-shirt and voting BNP?</p>

Nothing like a good night's sleep and a picture-perfect sunny day to raise the spirits! We're going to go for a nice walk in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abney_Park_Cemetery"">Abney Park cemetery </a>this morning (it's a nature reserve really, so is much more pleasant than it sounds) but then it's down to bizniz. Today I'll make a good crack at finishing off the layout of City Cycling. I may even come up with a suitable strapline to replace the not-really-very-professional one that you see in the picture. 

I'm very excited about this book, and I think a lot of other city cyclists will be, too. The Tour de France is coming to London next month; more people are taking to the roads on their bikes as traffic and congestion reach new heights; there is a critical mass of cyclists and with critical mass comes safety. Richard Ballantine (whose parents founded Ballantine publishers - good stock, no?) was the first, back in the 70s, to suggest that cyclists are traffic. This went against the received wisdom of the time that cyclists should stay out of the way of motorists. Richard suggested that cyclists should behave on the roads in a way which ensured their safety and asserted their right to be there, rather than hide in the gutter where it is actually rather dangerous.","As you'll know, this is still, oddly, a contentious position. However, with more people getting on their bikes, there are getting to be sufficient numbers to tip the balance in favour of cyclists' position on the roads. Here's hoping our book - which covers cycling in traffic, maintenance, how to buy a bike on all budgets, and all manner of other delights - will help people to cycle well and safely. 

I've got to say, since I started cycling in London in 2005, I have hugely increased my love of London. It makes a big difference if you only have to go on the Tube or buses once a month rather than twice a day. Aside from the strangely firm muscles I have in my thighs, I get to see more, and - god - the time I save! It takes 15 minutes tops, in heels, to get from the office to, say, Centrepoint. It would take me at least 40 minutes on the buses or Tube, and it's far less pleasant. 

When I've finished the layout (it's stuffed with pictures and illustrations so is taking forever) I will post some pages up here - and maybe even give a few copies away for free!","","","","2007-06-02","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

It's been interesting talking to people about our new team structure. Often they've looked horrified and said 'but Emma, how on earth will you cope with all the work?' Interesting question, and worth a post, I reckon. 

I'm no better than any other small publisher at the actual publishing side of things. I am just as bad (because, face it, no-one gets it right 100% of the time) at picking sure-fire winners as the next woman. But I don't think I'm being too egotistical when I say I am a lot more efficient than most people.","Take time management, for instance. What do you do when you get in in the morning? Turn on your PC, fire up Outlook, get a cup of coffee? Browse your email, action a few, and leave the rest in the ever-expanding intray? Do you look at your long to-do list, add a few things, and start to chip away at it in no particular order? Then get fed up because 30 emails arrive in one go, so you start to go through them? 

Here's what I do. I get in, and immediately open and start working on my Current Big Project. That is usually some major typesetting or editing project (it's City Cycling's layout at the moment). I don't even open Outlook, or a web browser. I work on the project for an hour or so. In the old days, (like, a couple of months ago until I learned all this stuff) I used to put off major projects like that, thinking that I could only do them if I blocked out a full day to do them. Obviously I never have a full day free, so they never got done. If I start to work on them first thing with no procrastination, no coffee-getting (well, maybe one), no email checking, no interruptions I can do a bit on them every day until they're done. 

Another thing I've discovered relatively recently is that having an Uber list, or Ever Growing List of Doom, is a bad idea. It's not motivational to have a list that you can never reach the end of, and the large things on the list, for the above reasons, never get done. Instead, I have a rolling daily to do list. I look at my outstanding tasks and assign them a deadline. Then I estimate how long each one will take. Say I was planning a Monday: I would look at the tasks that had a deadline of Monday or Tuesday, and plan out Monday until the total of the time-estimates came to 8 hours. I bump the rest to Tuesday, fill that up, and so on. I include time on the schedule for interruptions, meetings and phone calls. I also block out three half-hour slots for dealing with email in bulk - it's so much quicker than being interrupted each time an email arrives and dealing with them as they come. So by the end of each day I know I've done a full day's work, and that there are no tasks outstanding without a time-slot. Everything's managed and I can go off training, or home, with a clear conscience. 

I also do things as they arise, little and often. No more saving up invoices until there's a big batch of them lurking in the intray, which I used to do until recently and which resulted in Nightmare Bookkeeping Day. I get them, I input them to Sage, I set up the electronic payment with a pre-set date, I file them. I am always up to date. 

Another area is automation. I've been investigating Indesign scripts recently. Once you get past the fact that it's all a bit techie, it becomes second nature - plus, thanks to the Lovely Internet, there are scripts out there posted up by kind people for no money that do most tasks. I found one today that takes all the images in a folder and lays them out in a pre-selected catalogue format, and uses the file names as captions. The example worked with a 5000 image folder I tested it on. Hmmm, I wonder if that will ever come in useful... like, every month! XML, management reporting, ONIX and so forth are other areas where we've got our processes down to a nice, smooth, automatic flow. 

Finally I have to say that we are more skilled than most publishers at using the tools of our trade. I consider us to be expert Photoshop and InDesign users. This really came home to me the other day when I did some training for another small publisher. I was really quite amazed that anyone manages to get anything done in publishing if they don't know about master pages, auto-numbering, autoflow and paragraph styles in layout programs - simple stuff, and barely scratches the surface of what the programs are capable of, but the alternative is days of work or the cost and hassle of managing freelancers to do it for you. 

So I've been saying to people who wonder about whether I can manage all this work: don't worry. I think we've got it covered. I even get the sense that having fewer people around might encourage me to find even more efficient ways of working - and might save a couple of hours a day of chatting! Like I say, I don't think it necessarily means we're going to have a million-pound bestseller - there is a lot of magic to publishing that doesn't automatically happen, no matter how organised you are - but at least we're not going to be bogged down by the hundreds of small, dull tasks a publisher has to do. We have plenty of time to spend on the stuff that matters.","","","","2007-06-02","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

What would you say if I told you about a satirical story in which even academic essays were written in a phonetic language rather similar to the one the youth of today use when texting each other. Hardly biting satire, I suppose. I mean you hear about kids using 'txt spk' in schoolwork, so it's not the most inspired satirical leap to have teachers and academics using it too. Mind you, if I say that the story was published in 1912, that might make it a little more impressive.","Perhaps you know Max Beerbohm's story <em>Enoch Soames</em>? It includes a trip into the future to the year 1997 to the Reading Room of the British Museum, where apparently, even in that distant era, you're still not allowed to smoke.

I don't know much about proper literature, but Soames and Baudelaire seem to have a few things in common. The satanism and the similarity between naming your book of poems 'Les Fleurs du Mal' compared with Soames's poisonous 'Fungoids'. Am I going to have to face the fact that there's a whole additional level of satire going on here that I'm not going to get? Sigh.","","","","2007-06-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"
"40958","","1","Useful yet SO DULL","Publish","true","<img alt=""tax.gif"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/tax.gif"" width=""160"" height=""62"" />

As this blog has noted over the past few days, there are interesting things about publishing that publishers should spend time on, and there are UTTERLY DULL AND AWFUL things that no-one should be forced to spend time on. The trick, I have noted, is to automate the dull stuff as much as possible. And seeing as I've gone to the bother of automating, or at least documenting, the stuff I find the least enjoyable, I thought I'd share a selection of them with you, lucky readers, so you don't have to go through the UNUTTERABLE AWFULNESS of phoning six different tax offices and foreign consulates to find out how to avoid being taxed twice on foreign royalties. Yaw-n.","So, if you sell rights to a foreign publisher, chances are they won't release the advance or royalties money until you have produced a stamped Double Taxation Treaty form proving that you, the UK publisher, are resident in the UK and not running some dodgy dual-residence scam out of Albania. 

If the foreign publisher has sent a form, send it to your UK tax office with a polite letter asking them to stamp it and return it. I enclose an addressed envelope - I get the sense that if you don't, it has to be passed on to the Address Writing On Envelope Tax Office Section which is based in Pontefract and which adds another week to the process (or so it seems). Our tax office is as below, but yours might be different. You find the address on correspondance, or on those rather pointless yet colourful yellow paying-in-slip booklets for NI and income tax which never get used because everything is BACSed:

tel 01274 539321
 
 
If they haven't sent a form, phone up the people below and ask to be sent a form. They will expect you to be calling from a foreign country. Made-up Russian accents are optional, however - just ask them for the double taxation treaty form for whichever country you need. Then send it to your tax office.

If they insist on using this god-awful logo, the rest of the world will think that London is full of throw-back loons. If they don't respond positively to the abject horror that every single person who's commented on it has displayed and come up with a better one, I'm not going to support the Olympics.

<p>Back away; it's the return of the green P of politics.</p>
<p>Thought I'd contribute some perspective to the Olympic logo debate. You haven't seen overspending until you've seen <a href=""http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/060607E.shtml"">this</a>.</p>","<p>It's an article about U.S. 'defence' spending. Sounds a bit dull I know, but the staggering, gargantuan, cataclysmic madness of it makes it slightly more captivating reading. You know how journalists (at least British ones) like to translate things into numbers of football pitches and heights of double-decker buses? This is one of those articles that makes you want to do the same. Total up the number of 'islamofascists' who hate America and divide that into the number of tanks, planes and missiles the U.S. has. Or work out how many countries the U.S. could fight simultaneously. We are not far from the point where America could fight the whole rest of the world, providing they didn't restrict themselves to a ground war. They could certainly extinguish all human life. It's difficult to understand the need for those capabilities. (Although I'm certain the British government covets them.) And by what mental gymnastics do they manage to feel threatened? 911 isn't something you could prevent with thousands of tanks or by developing new nuclear weapons. And no one else has threatened the U.S., unless you count Saddam Hussein's plan to launch his stockpiles of deadly WMDs against us all, which I'm hoping you don't. And meanwhile we have a genuine global crisis that needs addressing (I'm not going to say which one; you should all remember by now.)</p>
<p>So from the outrageous to the kooky now because I want to talk about Fermi's Paradox and my favourite depressing solution to it. Fermi's Paradox starts by working out the chances of intelligent life arising. It's a tricky estimate to make because it's largely guesswork, but however small you decide the odds are, there are an awful lot of planets out there, and for each one you have to roll the dice. And we're helped by the fact we know life originated once, so clearly it's not impossible. 250 billion stars in our galaxy and more galaxies in the universe than anyone could ever count. The sheer amount of real estate out there with little rock-pools of chemicals bubbling away is astronomical; and once life takes hold, it does its best to keep evolving. Which means sooner or later it will presumably produce a technological species. And that's what leads to Fermi's Paradox. All those stars, all those planets, but where are the alien civilisations? Building the first radio telescope should have been like opening the door to a West End pub on a Friday night. There should have been (I think the technical term is) an almighty hubbub. But there wasn't. We didn't detect anything that seemed like signs of extra-terrestrial life. Our civilisation can't help emitting radio waves so where is everyone else's chatter and radiation? Give it a moment's thought and you can probably come up with your own solution to Fermi's Paradox. They're too advanced to use electricity. God made us unique. The sums are wrong and life is very rare. They are among us already. And so on. It's a nerdy intellectual game, but sort of a fun one.</p>
<p>But my favourite depressing solution goes like this: once a civilisation is advanced enough to generate electricity and produce radio waves - and thus to be detectable by others - it will also have the power to destroy itself. Which it promptly does. The idea is that the interval between a race generating its first radio waves and then wiping itself out is so short that each one is gone long before the next arises. Our first transatlantic radio transmissions occurred 105 years ago. As I read the papers today the world's only superpower is ploughing 50% of its vast resources into weaponry while ignoring an approaching mega-catastrophe set to destroy half the cities of the world and turn a sizeable chunk of Earth's population into hungry refugees. Is there any reason for us to behave this way? Not that I can see, but we are. Is the notion of working together so difficult and unappealing that self-destruction is simply the norm for technological species?</p>
<p>I tell you, it's all just a little bit heavy for a grey Thursday morning. But don't be depressed. I only brought it up to take your mind off the Olympic logo.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Katherine, my view is that if we only used the military for defending against attacks and for peacekeeping, we could exclusively use NATO or a similar shared force. Conventional forces (not to mention ICBMs) are no use at police/detective/intelligence work, which is what chasing Al Qaeda requires. Western nations only need total control of an army if they want to go adventuring. If Europe, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, etc shared a military force, there's no conceivable way someone could start dropping bombs on America or invading France (pretty much unthinkable events anyway) without their allies offering the full support of the shared force. And a shared military funded by so many nations would be unbeatable. It's only countering imaginary threats or launching pre-emptive attacks for which one needs one's own military, and those are exactly the campaigns I'm against.</p>

<p><b>Non-geeks, stop reading now.</b>
John, there have been multi-cellular organisms on Earth for 700 million years, so the universe has been making organisms that could have developed technology for at least half a billion years, most likely much, much longer. Half a billion light years takes in a lot of galaxies. Our local supercluster is only 200 million light years across and that contains at least a hundred galaxies. Granted, aliens might not use radio for communication, but if they switch large amounts of electricity they'd be putting out interesting radio waves. If you rule out using electrons to move energy or using photons for interstellar communication (which we haven't detected either), you're talking about a race that doesn't do its engineering with conventional matter much any more. Surely not everyone has become wispy entities composed of pure enlightenment. And even then, it would be nice if they dropped in to chat before we blow ourselves up.</p>","","","","2007-06-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"
"40962","","1","Trying...to...be...upbeat","Publish","true","After the dullness of double taxation treaties and the horrors of certain environmental doom, I am determined to be upbeat and, er bubbly. Just don't say G8 to me. Don't say it... don't...

Quick, think positive! OK. Firstly I have had a very enjoyable evening at the Savile Club, where women are still a thing to be - feared? rejected? avoided? something or other, because women are still not allowed to be members. Whatever: the Savile Club was just the venue for a really lovely evening. Hmm, that went from positive to not-so-positive very quickly. Try again... 

Ah! I have very positive things to say about a very specific set of books. Those books are my open university course books. Oh, how I love them.","Firstly, they arrive every eight weeks or so in a thrillingly chunky brown package. Brown packages! Don't get more exciting than that, no siree. Each year(ish)-long course has its own set of specially-written books. They form a set. The covers go and look good on the shelves.  Lovely. They are a good size for reading in the bath (sorry, Mark) and have decent margins for writing in. 

Overall, they are a million miles away from the turgid, badly written nonsense I had to struggle through as a younger student. Finally, finally now I realise that it's the writers that had the problem, not me. I thought I was the stupid one for not being able to follow tortured, incoherent, jargon-stuffed sentences. If only I'd skipped GCSEs and A levels, and my regular degree, and gone straight from the 11plus to the OU. I could have fitted 3 degrees in by the time I was 21, and it would have been so much more enjoyable! 

I would recommend OU course books even if you're not doing a degree. You can buy them from bookstores. <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Natural-Social-Uncertainty-Introduction-Sciences/dp/0415329701/ref=sr_1_36/026-2193700-1939634?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181254010&sr=8-36"">This one </a>is particularly good. 

I am doing an OU degree because I have this mental image of myself at 45, wearing silk gloves and having excellent posture and skin tone, and being utterly knowledgeable about <em>everything</em>.  I have to admit that there is what one might call a chasm between that future me and the person I am at the moment. Hence the learning. And hell, if I can fit it in, whilst running a business full time, socialising at men-only clubs and fist-fighting the rest of the time, then you can too.","","","","2007-06-07","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Oh dear. Someone's forgotten that in polite society one is meant to keep one's right-wing tendencies under wraps. 

The story that's circulating about Persephone Books' latest <a href=""http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/letter.htm"">Letter </a>, in which they assert that book review blogs offer 'mere yammering' compared to the 'logically reasoned discourse that sits still on a page, inviting serious engagement', is an interesting one.","Interesting for its utter bone-headedness, on one level; interesting too because of the ideas about branding that it raises.

Why do we trust an opinion? Take a book that has been positively reviewed in The Times by a well-known author or professional critic. 'Ooh,' the reader thinks, 'The Times is important. They must know quality when they see it; I shall purchase this book forthwith'. Well, maybe the reader doesn't think quite so expicitly about the endorsement - better things to spend your brainpower on, frankly - but that's the essence of it. The reader trusts the review because they believe in The Times' brand - a construct created by a successful, and in this case long-term, marketing strategy. 

Now take a book that has been reviewed by, say, <a href=""http://www.dovegreyreader.typepad.com/"">DoveGreyReader</a>. DoveGreyReader hasn't written any books (that I know of), nor does she write reviews in order to pay the mortgage, so why should I trust what she thinks? I trust her, implicitly, far more than the Times review, in fact, because I know that she writes from the heart. I know that she isn't moving in a complicated, political world where books get reviewed because of connections. I trust her precisely because she hasn't got paid to write. Her 'brand', as it were, is above reproach. It achieves what large companies pay zillions of pounds to emulate and still fail to reach: a sense that the brand is trustworthy, that it has your best interests at heart, that it is honest.

There are comparisons to be drawn with news networks and news bloggers. I am almost at the end of my tether with the BBC news. Andy spends all day in front of a Reuters news feed - new stories appearing by the minute - and so when we get home and watch the five or six stories that the BBC has extracted and compare them to the hundreds of, often far more important and newsworthy, happenings, it makes me shudder to think of how ill-informed we are. Thank god for the news blogs: blogs that aren't hamstrung by political affiliations, spin, money and power. These blogs draw people's attention to events that would otherwise go un- or under-reported; events that actually matter. On this morning's BBC effort: Paris Hilton is in prison and something about strawberries. I'm sure there can be nothing more important. Nothing at all. Did you know that this week a mass grave has been discovered in the Ukraine containing thousands of Jews murdered in the Second World War? Or that it has been proven that Cheney personally blocked the promotion of a government lawyer who had raised objections to the Bush administration's domestic surveillance program, and that administration officials tried to get then-Attorney General John Ashcroft to sign off on the program as he lay recovering from major surgery in his hospital bed? Rob told me today that the U.S. Department of Justice tried to obfuscate a story by issuing 3,000 pages of documentation about a particular set of meetings, with a nicely-spun summary. The professional journalists took the summary and ran with it. A political news blog, <a href=""http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/002809.php"">TPMmuckraker</a>, sent a call out for volunteer fact-checkers to get in touch. They divvied up the documents, worked through the night and uncovered all sorts of things that the Bush Administration had tried to hide. Far from being unprofessional, some blogs are doing the sort of investigative journalism that the salaried journos don't seem to bother with any more. 

One more thing about professionals. I used to be in awe of professionals; people who, clearly, knew better than me, because of their training and experience. Their expertise was undoubted. I worked for a lot of them, within industry and as a consultant. Thing was, I was always surprised that their actions didn't always result in success. I thought it must have been some other factor: after all, these were the experts. Finally it dawned on me, of course: people can be in positions of power, and can be articulate, educated and bright, but it doesn't mean that they know what they're doing. Ineptitude coupled with arrogance: it rarely ends well. 

Coming back to books: there's a bit of point-missing going on here, too. Who is the most important person in this picture? Wait - it couldn't - surely it couldn't be the reader? If readers enjoy a book, regardless of whether it stands up to the scrutiny of a scholar, that is all that matters. The enjoyment of a book is pretty much purely subjective. If people love it - and love it enough to talk about it on their own time from the heart - that makes it a success. Further, if professional reviewers were so great at knowing what people would enjoy, surely they'd have started their own publishing companies by now and used their powers of insight into taste to make their fortunes? Professional reviews aren't for the reader; they're for the reviewer. 

It's the 'arbiter of taste' thing that I worry about with publishing itself. I can't get comfortable with the idea that publishers know, any better than the reader, whether a book is 'good' enough to be published. What training do we have that gives us the expertise to make that choice? There are much better-read, better-educated people than me out there. There are also a squillion people who enjoy books that I can't stand. The idea that experts are allowed to filter the readers' choice is one which I think will have to change, at some point. Cue the best thing the human race has come up with in the last fifty years, amongst all the warmongering, the power struggles, the whole planet-destruction-thing: the internet. 

It is crucial that bloggers are supported and encouraged. They are one of the best ways of getting a democratic, honest consensus in a world where everything is spun and affected by political agendas. In fact - you can see where I'm going with this - I think they should be invited to get involved *before* publication. Any bloggers out there want to talk to me about this? 

This post will probably mean we never get another newspaper review again. Fact is, if I had to choose between the support of the papers and the support of the bloggers, I'd go for the bloggers every time because they are the ones who the reader can trust for an honest, from-the-heart opinion, 100% of the time - and, in case you hadn't noticed, I care, more than anything, about the reader.","","","","2007-06-10","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","10"

Instead, he and a group of likemindeds have come up with an excellent fringe festival to complement the London Literary Festival. In the spirit of the sorts of things we've been talking about on the blog of late - letting the people decide what books they want to read - this is an open, inclusive and wide-ranging festival. 

It runs 29th June to 13th July. Snowbooks will be running a couple of events, although they're not yet properly planned so you'll have to wait to see what they are! More as it comes.

... you're flat-out frantic, no time to even get a coffee or go to the loo, up against all sorts of deadlines, then you glance at a submission and look up three hours later having realised you've read the lot in one sitting. A very pleasant sunny Friday afternoon treat! 

Interestingly, although I was captivated, there's still no guarantee that we'll offer to publish it. We are That Picky. But as I mentioned the other day, what, really, gives me the right to censor the readers' options like that? Sure, it's my company's money on the line, but it's likely that people would enjoy the book. 

We do think that people will find better ways of figuring out what they should and shouldn't read. It's been one of the things we've discussed on our great strategy week (a week this time! Not just a day!) thinking about this sort of stuff. When it's all percolated through I'll give you an update. This weekend, however, I have to do an essay and finish laying out City Cycling. I hope it rains - makes me feel less bad about staying in.

On the Global Warming front, I'm pleased to say, I think we've got past the following view:  '10,000 scientists say it's real; three who work for Exxon say it's not. It's too soon to say who's right'. Now a good number of us are agreed it's real and humans are largely to blame. So thank goodness we've been able to put scepticism behind us and move on to despair. 

One of the most common expressions of despair that I hear is this one: 'what can one lone person like me do that's going to matter?' Now, since the people expressing that view are usually doing so in a newspaper or on TV, I think the answer is obvious: set an example. But even if you leave that aside, I have to say that sentiment doesn't really coincide with my own feelings - and not because I'm a saint - in fact the opposite.","What I want to do is have solar cells on my roof, a heat-pump to heat my house, kick-ass high-end double glazing and I want to recycle and buy locally bought food that I bring home on my bike. Why? Well, because I think I should. But also because I don't like worrying about the fate of the world. It's depressing. I want to be able to say smugly, ""I'm doing my bit. If everyone were like me, there wouldn't be a problem."" It's not an attitude to be proud of, but it is an attitude that would contribute to the salvation of the planet. It's not the ultimate solution, but it's better than where we are now. So don't despair of yourself; get stuck in and then despair of everyone else, smug in the knowledge that you're superior.","","","","2007-06-17","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Blimes, I have done a lot today, which I have only achieved through being fortified by a steady flow of Mini Battenburgs. Now I feel like a podge. I should have sent them to my lovely dad as a nice Father's Day treat.","Before I say anything about today, some unfinished business about yesterday. Doctor Who was an immense disappointment to me. Andy and I have come, sadly, to the conclusion that RT Davies is a third rate mind. The episode had so much going for it on paper: the sexiest man in the world; the second sexiest man in the world; a world-class actor in a bit-part; another world-class actor making his entrance. But all those things were a crutch for the script, a script which had, yet again, too bloody much running down corridors - STOP IT. STOP MAKING THEM RUN DOWN CORRIDORS - useless aliens (in ONE TRILLION years, is the best you can come up with pointy teeth?), that stupid sonic screwdriver (please, god, give him a new toy) and rubbish truck technology. It was only thanks to the stellar, wonderful, inspired acting that it wasn't a write-off, but David Tennant et al deserve more. 

But despite all that I woke up full of beans, determined to rise above the idiots who live either side of us and to have a good day. And I have! I have finished laying out City Cycling. The only thing stopping me sharing it with you is that the smallest PDF I can generate is 86mb. That gives you an indication of how much work it's been! AND then I have finished my essay! Whoop! 

And even better - in researching (heh) the image for this post I came across an excellent wiki site called Uncyclopedia - ""the content-free encyclopedia that anyone can edit"". Hee! It's a bit Douglas Adamsy, which means it is something I love. <a href=""http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Battenburg"">Here is the entry </a>for Battenburg: 

""Battenburg is a town somewhere in Germany in Hessianland which is, oh, right about the middle. It is divided into the yellow quarter, the pink quarter, the yellow quarter and the pink quarter. The few people that live there are employed by Battenburg Ltd., a large scale bakery operation that produces all sorts of fancy namby-pamby tea cakes. These cakes are exported all over the world and are best enjoyed by wimps drinking tea. Naturally the very best tea is stolen from East India Trading Company ships by pirates. However if supplies of jacked tea are limited, then it may also be enjoyed with unjacked tea but with far less satisfaction to the wimps, and the pirates."" And so on.

In the bag this morning: apocalypse, me nearly losing my rag and why, and the greatness of small businesses.","<img alt=""3D9781905005611.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/3D9781905005611.jpg"" width=""180"" height=""185"" /> First, the end of the world. There's an interesting <a href=""http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/06/apocalypse_fiction_is_a_revela.html"">post on the Guardian blog</a> about apocalypse fiction. You might have noticed that we at Snowbooks are fans of end of the world stuff: zombies, horsemen (oh yes - I can't wait to introduce you to Mike McBride's new book, <a href=""http://snowbooks.com/web9781905005611.html"">The Fall,</a> which we are publishing in October), vampires. Any authors who are thinking about submitting that manner of book - yes please! (Or climate change, if you are a professor who doesn't work for Exxon.)

Next, me getting cross about things. I don't know. Maybe I was a bit tired - but I refrained from posting about this late last night and after a good night's sleep I'm still riled about it. I went to the otherwise amazing Meet the Buyers event run by the IPG last night. It's astonishing that for under &pound;20 we got to sit in a room with buyers from many of our most crucial customers whilst they presented their strategies and wants to us. You wouldn't catch retailers like B&Q doing that, unless it was to soften people up ahead of announcing a strategic project of cost reduction. Oh, those heady days. The buyers then circulated around each of ten tables where the membership sat, answering questions posed to them and generally being as open and accessible as they could possibly manage. 

Which was why I was so bloody cross at a man on our table whose attitude, frankly, sucked. Far from realising that he was in a position to not only talk to people who could transform his business, but who had given up their evenings to do it, he asked questions fairly aggressively because his starting point, I assume, was 'bloody retailers, they never buy my books, it's not fair, nothing I say will get them to buy books from me.' 

Er, hello? How about taking a look at your list, in the first place. How about seeing whether the books you publish, oblivious to your customers, are the sort of books that people want to buy in bookstores? The retailers aren't there to do your bidding or provide you with some sort of service; they only ever have the reader in mind. If readers don't want your books, don't expect the retailers to magically stock them. 

Anyway, I kept my temper whilst he was being annoying, because it's his loss if he doesn't get it. But towards the end of the evening I just had to have a pop at him, because of this final straw. A retailer was talking about the importance of getting timely, accurate bibliographic data to them, so that they knew about his books and thus could buy them. Not, you see, rocket science. This chap got all puffed up and said 'well I don't set publication dates for my books, and I don't have a jacket for the books until four weeks before publication'. And then glared at the retailer as if to say 'so that's your problem, not mine. What are you going to do about it?' 

And that was the point, dear reader, at which I pretty much lost my rag. 

The funny thing is that I have no fear of retribution and emails of complaint if the person in question reads this blog, because earlier in the evening mention had been made of blogging. Quite a few people around the table had no idea what the word meant, and, I kid you not, one woman said 'what is this blogging of which you speak'? Those actual words! Classic. The chap I've been talking about said 'I'm too old for this blogging thing!' and looked all pleased with himself. Yes. Well done. You must be very proud. 

Ah, that's better. Nothing like a cathartic rant to clear the cobwebs. On to something about small businesses and why they are great. They are great because they are too small to have hierarchies (proper, multi-person hierarchies) and an absence of hierarchies means a presence of humanity. I was chatting away to some much nicer, indeed quite wonderful small publishers last night. We were discussing a certain thing, and I was able to say, on the spot 'oh, I can help you with that. Email me tomorrow and I'll send you advice and info on how to do it'. I won't bore you with what it was; suffice to say that I didn't have to get sign-off, I didn't have to follow a Company line on whether it was acceptable to share priviledged information with another company who, in theory, is a competitor. I could just briefly consult my conscience, which said 'yes, that would be a very friendly and helpful thing to do', and make a decision which will hopefully help someone else. It's a small, but rather fundamental point: when people do business with people, it all seems to be nice and friendly and mutually lovely. When businesses do business with businesses, it can get a lot more murky. 

So! Those are the things I wanted to say. And now I will do some work. Maybe have a coffee. Ooh, yes, coffee. Have a lovely day.","","","","2007-06-21","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","5"

<p><a href=""http://business.guardian.co.uk/privateequity/story/0,,2107831,00.html"">Nice to see</a> that the Treasury is unimpressed by the idea of lowering tax on Private Equity (PE) investments. I was one of those who initially liked the concept of Private Equity turnarounds. You combine a crack management team with a big equity fund and buy a business with the intention of renovating it - usually with a plan to go public again in a year or two.</p>","<p>In case anyone doesn't know what those words mean, but would like to, let me explain. 'Going public' means selling shares in a company on the stock exchange to anyone who wants to buy them. The people who own the shares own the company and are entitled to the profits. The first stage of a private equity deal, though, is usually the opposite: to 'take the business private' - which means buying up all the shares of a business so you own it outright. In a PE deal, the money for that comes from an investment fund. Investors put money into a PE fund and the fund goes out and buys a company with that money. The investors get their money back, plus profits, when the company is sold by once again 'going public'.</p> <p>Good PE deals shake up stale businesses and show others in the industry that change is possible. Bad ones are not much more than asset stripping. </p> <p>The money for these deals often goes through a number of offshore holdings companies. Nothing necessarily wrong with that: it's about making sure the tax, bankruptcy and ownership rules fit the deal you're trying to do. Although I suppose one could argue that a deal that was good for Britain wouldn't <em>need</em> to go via the Cayman Islands. The other reason these holding companies, or Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV)*, can seem dodgy is that they hide details of ownership. Even if you could jump on a plane to the island of Nauru, the banks there wouldn't show you their files. I'm sure most big deals are legit, but there's at least one where I believe a full disclosure of ownership would cause a major scandal. (Sadly there's no way for me to say any more without putting Snowbooks at risk.)</p> <p>The point, though, about whether these deals should be taxed relates to something at the heart of capitalism: it's the fact that there's no capitalism in the wild; it's always artificial, it always takes place inside an economy where the taxes and laws have been set up a certain way. In other words, it's a game played according to rules, and the rules can be as fair or as skewed as you want.</p> <p>That's why when right-wingers talk about the need to reward success I always want to say, ""Ahhh, well, but..."". Because success is a lot easier to achieve if you're paying 5% tax than 50%. 

In America, for instance, the economy overall is growing fairly nicely, but almost everyone in America is effectively poorer than they were a few years ago. How is that possible? Well, the gains that push the average up are confined to a small group of people who have got very rich indeed. And a big part of that has happened because taxes on big business and private investment have gone down. If you make your money in the form of a salary, you'll pay as much tax as ever, maybe more. But if it's share options, or earnings on investments, you might be handing over a lot less to the government. Similarly, small businesses pay as much tax as ever, but big businesses pay a tiny fraction of what they used to.</p> <p>Why should this be? Well I believe it's because government sets the rules under which capitalism operates - and big business (at least in the U.S.) puts vast amounts of money and effort into influencing those rules. The credit card companies lobby over bankruptcy laws, the logging and mining companies help draft environmental laws, the pharmaceutical companies make sure citizens don't buy their drugs cheaply from Canada, and the weapons and oil companies... arrange for their suggestions to be classified.</p> <p>So the point is, it's nice to see that while the U.K. government might do whatever the White House tells them, they haven't yet made the placing of foxes into henhouses a matter of general policy.</p>

*I had an SPV as a child, but that was a Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle of the kind favoured by Captain Scarlet.

Interestingly, I seem to have underestimated the extent to which the U.K. has followed the same course as the U.S. The Guardian is doing a special feature this week about how Britain is effectively a tax haven for billionaires and the middle class are realising they've been left behind. Not sure how sympathetic I am to the middle class's plight, but if they get militant enough about it, there might be a reining in of the 'tax breaks for the rich' movement.","","","","2007-06-21","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

I have an opinion. It is different. Interested? 
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>","So there's a lot of kerfuffle in the trade and wider press at the moment about Waterstone's rate card for Christmas. Never let it be said that publishers have a firm grasp of English: clearly one of them didn't quite understand the word 'confidential' on the letter and so thought it would be a good idea to leak the rate card to the press. Cue a lot of jumping up and down and letters from Outraged of Tunbridge Wells. 

Let me give you my opinion, for what it's worth. From my perspective, there is no point in publishing books unless I can find a cost-effective way to let a lot of people know about them. The importance of being cost-effective rules out broad-brush stroke advertising like tube ads, and the need to reach a lot of people rules out scattergun approaches like sending expensive proofs to reviewers. The best, proven way for me to reach lots of people is to create a mini-billboard that clearly advertises what the book is about, then somehow display that billboard in more than 1000 locations. Hmmm - how on earth can I do that, I wonder? Oh, I know - how about using the cover design and working with the retailers to get it into a prominent, front of store location. 

That's the thing, you see: retailers provide access to some of the best, high footfall  locations in the UK. We don't have to persuade people they want to buy a book - they have, of their own accord, walked right into the store! They want to buy a book! We just have to stand slightly to their side, cough quietly, and the job's done. 

Retail space is chronically under-valued by publishers. How much do you suppose it would cost me to rent 300 prime retail locations in the UK, fill them with staff, paint them a nice colour, manage their stock, and magic up 10,000-odd visitors a day? A chuff of a lot, that's how much. 

In this context, I happen to think that &pound;6000 for three month's space at the front of 270 such locations is a bit of a bargain. Sure, I can't afford to buy a lot of them, and sure, it's a problem for my cash flow - but Snowbooks is a business, and it's the job of business to manage its cost base and revenues to make a profit. How much money do the publishers who are complaining about this rate card spend on outsourcing tasks they should be doing in-house? How much do they spend on advances? Frankfurt hotels? Dinners? Broad-brush advertising? Expensive proofs? A hardback publication just to get reviews for the paperback? Inefficiencies? I don't mean to be too critical, but the first thing to do is to critique your own business before - god help us - criticising your <em>most important customers</em>. 

We will be submitting titles for the Christmas promotion, and we will be excited if we get onto it, because - I say again - there is no point in publishing books if we don't find ways to get them in front of readers. Once that job is done, it's down to the book. Last Christmas, the Adept-Ex Machina Omnibus went into the Waterstone's Christmas promotion and flew - it sold 10,000 units in two months making us a tidy profit - taking the marketing spend into account - and making good royalties for the author. 

To say that I am horrified by the rate card kerfuffle is an understatement. I don't understand it; I don't understand the mindset of the people who are complaining and I don't like that, far from creating a collaborative supply chain, yet again the publishing industry is demonstrating that it is not progressive. It's all very well getting excited about the future of books and digitisation and cutting edge technology, but if this trade can't even get its head around basic supply chain collaboration I fear for it, I really do.","","","","2007-06-22","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","5"

A couple of weeks ago Rob, Anna and I sat down for almost a week straight and talked about what we were going to do for the next five or so years. Here is our strategy.","Firstly, how the company is run. The general principle is to automate all the boring stuff so we can concentrate on the important things like creating books and developing the company. To that end, we plan to make even more use of Anko's APM system, a remarkably complete software package for the price. This contains most of the business' information including bibliographic data, marketing, contacts, production, print scheduling, royalties, author information and contracts, rights and customer information. Marvellous. On top of that, we'll continue to automate the production of our catalogue webpages and AIs using XSLT which turns them into html. New projects scheduled for the automatatron include a scheduling system (think klaxons and yellow flashing lights when our stock levels of a particular line get to a pre-set level), a whizzy submissions system (think giant hopper into which authors drop submissions, and the best ones drop out the end. Or something. The details aren't worked out yet) and silly things like a photoshop droplet that converts an image into a 3d image, a little application which cross references the amazon system with ours to check Nielsen haven't somehow corrupted the data, and a way of getting comments to be filtered properly on this blog so that I don't have to manually edit them! I reckon a year or two of automating bits and bobs here and there will result in a pretty smooth-running company. 

Secondly, what the company will publish. We are going to focus in on a few core categories. In fiction they are: Historical fiction, Horror and Supernatural Thrillers. We are also going to publish General Fiction which, oddly, is its own genre. In non-fiction, we are going to focus on lifestyle books. This covers Crafts, Sport and Fitness (covering martial arts, fitness and cycling), Food and Gift. 

Why are we focusing on these categories? Our favourite fiction is in these categories; we are either expert in or passionate about the non-fiction categories. We are also good at spotting winners in these areas, and publishing them well. And they make us - and our authors - money. 

They are also areas that we feel we can earn our keep in. There is a school of thought which suggests that in ten years time the self-publishing model will be so developed, and the internet so good at searching and filtering content, that the role of the fiction publisher will be redundant. Will people need the authority of a company to say 'yes, 200,000 books were written last year but we think you should only have access to these 2,000'? It's a tough one - it might happen, might not. If it does, it will be because authors have found a way to disintermediate the publishing industry. All power to them, frankly - we would never stand in the way of progress - but we need to make sure we're not going to be out of a job in ten years. I'm not putting in all this bloody work only for publishing to witness a disruptive technology! So to that end we are going to redouble our efforts in the colour non-fiction categories. 

Why's that? The non-fiction books we have published so far would never have seen the light of day were it not for us. The fiction, truth be told, could have been published by the author who may or may not have got their book the same sort of distribution as we've achieved. In the future, ensuring distribution may become easier. Amazon are turning into publishers; so are Borders in the US. Who knows what will happen. However, on a book like Crafter's Companion, or Fighting, we pretty much created those books ourselves. We commissioned (read: took) the photos; photoshopped them; laid the books out; edited them (*really* edited them!) and generally did a job of work to get them into existence. 

This sort of approach fits nicely with our stated values, which are, and always have been, to be proud of what we do, and happy. I've mentioned before that life is so much easier when you've got values to live by - you never need to make a decision again! Faced with a decision to publish a book by a really famous author (a book which happened to be utter garbage) we decided against it because, although we could have made a bob or two, we would have been embarrassed about it. Not proud! 

And we are going to be rather singleminded about becoming the best publisher in these fields. One of our main approaches will be to provide people who are interested in these areas with a place online where they can indulge, explore and further their interest. Watch this space for further announcements there! 

Thirdly, we are going to take our Snowbooks Publishing Services arm to the next level. We really enjoy cover design and our covers work well in bookstores, so we are going to continue to add projects and clients on that front. It helps us out on cash flow, as well. 

There's a whole bunch of other things on finance, sales and marketing too, but I have a load of things to do before knocking off for the day so I'll finish this strategery round up anon. Hope you find it interesting. I know none of it's rocket science but it is so useful to spend time thinking about our direction. When I'm flailing around knee-deep in 400 tasks, it's nice to know that they are all pulling in a deliberate direction. Ooh, Weberian. I'm learning something on this degree of mine, after all.","","","","2007-06-22","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

You don't hear the question, ""What do you mean by 'good' weather?"" very often. 'Good' is sunny and warm and dry. Except that I live in London and sunny and warm and dry usually means sweltering and humid with the sense that there's a big immobile stack of pollution pressing down on the city. When the weather gets hot I find I can't concentrate, I'm tired and I feel a bit sick a lot of the time. My least favourite is when the sky is grey but somewhere up above the sun is hammering down, cooking the exhaust fumes and making the air feel like a sick dog is panting on you. For a similar effect at other times of the year, just wrap a layer of cling-film around yourself before getting dressed in the morning.

But then it starts to rain and I feel better, my brain feels sharper and I'm ready to get on with things. And since most of what I do doesn't involve standing outside - though it may involve looking out the window occasionally - the rain isn't a problem. Actually, even when I do go out, I don't mind the rain. It might be unpleasant in the winter, when it's icy cold, but the occasional spritzing of luke warm water in the Summer seems quite agreeable. And in my mind, I can picture it scrubbing the pollen and carbon monoxide and exhaust particulates out of the air, making it safe to breathe again.","But then it starts to rain and I feel better, my brain feels sharper and I'm ready to get on with things.

And in my mind, I can picture it scrubbing the pollen and carbon monoxide and exhaust particulates out of the air, making it safe to breathe again.

So apologies to anyone who wishes they could sit outside cooking in the sun, but I've been <em>willing</em> it to rain for the last couple of months. The forecasters were warning that this Summer would be another record-breaker: hundred-plus degree heat on the tube, lots of respiratory problems, lots of heat-related deaths that only come to light months later when the statistics have been analysed - and me feeling not-quite-clever-enough the whole time.

Naturally I've recently ceased my attempts to mentally influence the weather; there's no need: it's Glastonbury followed by Wimbledon. Praying for rain is superfluous. But soon it'll be the middle of July and a heat wave is a very real possibility. So am I once again going to wish the rain clouds into place above our heads? Fear not, UV and pollution lovers; I have a different plan. I'm going to move to the Cotswolds some time in July, where I hope the hot weather manifests itself the way my memory tells me (reliably? not sure) that it did when I was little. Inside the thick stone walls of my new house it will be cool, and outside there will be drowsy bees and sleeping cats and lemonade and meadows full of flowers. Instead of thumping bass, there will be the soft muttering of Radio 4. Instead of mopeds revved to a mosquito-like whine by desperately bored teenagers there will be very old people hand-clipping hedges before settling down to the read the paper. Above all, there will be a breeze. And I can stop living like an albino vampire with M.E. through the summer months and instead write a couple of excellent novels. It's going to be great. Just as I've planned it.","","","","2007-06-24","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

As far as I'm concerned, the BBC can double their license fee and I'll happily pay up (or, more accurately, I'll ask Andy to happily pay up.) Last night's Doctor Who was marvellous...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>","The script did David Tennant and John Simms proud. Gorgeous Cap'n Jack was allowed to smoulder at suitably regular intervals; Martha wasn't half bad; there was a new take on running around fast (*driving* around fast. Yes!) and where there was running there were long coats flapping in the wind and everyone looking very serious (=ubersexy). There was an excellent A-team bit where the Doctor made some magic keys for everyone, and a smashing explosion (which was even better in Confidential, over on BBC Three, where they showed how they did it). There was excellent music when the baddies took over the world. There was even a credible US president. I'm a fan of any show which gives us a vaguely human US president - much-needed escapism. The only, tiny thing I didn't like was the voices of the evil floating balls - too childish and badly acted. 

And what made it all even better - there was a huge thunderstorm cracking away over London, and just as the excellent music started when the heavens were ripped asunder and the evil baddies started to descend, the skies outside our house lit up and it started to rain in torrents. Cool! 

AND THEN, we watched the second episode of the Jekyll and Hyde programme that the BBC are running, and *that* was blummin' marvellous too. What a great evening's entertainment! And then we watched coverage of Glastonbury and were glad we weren't covered in mud. And that was our Saturday night and it was excellent.","","","","2007-06-24","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"
"40982","","1","How we choose what to publish","Publish","true","<div style="" float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 20px;""><img alt=""heartbook.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/heartbook.jpg"" width=""160"" height=""113"" /></div>

One thing and another this week has made me think about writing a post that explains how Snowbooks chooses what it pubishes. I imagine, from a number of points of view, it is quite mystifying how publishers make the choice. Here we go, then. <br/><br/><br/>","Bear in mind that the Snowbooks team has changed shape recently. The description I'm going to give applies more to the future than the past. That is to say, it is more a reflection of how Anna and I work than how James and Gilly worked, and since we're the ones in sole charge of the shape of Snowbooks' forward list, that should be more useful. 

I'll focus on how we choose fiction, too. Creating our non-fiction list is a little more methodical, reasoned and deliberate. We have great passion for the non-fiction areas we publish in, and knowledge about what books readers would find useful. It's thus more of a commissioning than selection process. 

Let me provide some background, too. Snowbooks has an open submissions policy. From our own, selfish, point of view, we think it's great that most other publishers only accept manuscripts through agents. It means that the quality of writing we see on the submission list is that much higher than it would otherwise be, as the majority of writers are denied access to publishers. From an unagented author's point of view, of course, it sucks. Publishing is not a progressive industry. 

We get a lot of submissions. So many, in fact, that we don't give feedback - we'd never have time to do the actual publishing part of publishing, otherwise. Instead, we have an open rejection letter, available on this site. It's probably worth repeating it here as it contains many of our reasons for choosing, or not choosing, to make an offer of publication:

<em>The bad news, I'm sorry to say, is that Snowbooks isn't planning to publish the manuscript that you submitted to us. For many people, a letter like this is a big let-down, so it's probably a good idea to explain something about how we make the decision to reject a book so that you realise that it isn't necessarily a criticism of you or your writing.

When setting up Snowbooks, we didn't like the idea of having quotas of books to publish and we also didn't like the idea that one department acquires new manuscripts but then hands them on to other departments to market them or to turn the manuscripts into finished books (although that's the way most conventional publishers do things). 

Instead, we wanted the person who said 'we should publish this' to be the same person who followed the book all the way through to publication and beyond. Obviously, if someone knows they are going to be working on all aspects of a single book for at least six months, they'll only champion books that they love. So the fact that you were rejected by Snowbooks means that your book didn't become an instant all-time favourite with a member of our very small team - but it doesn't necessarily mean anything more. 

This is an open letter and so there's a chance, if we're being absolutely honest, that we did reject your book because it was awful. We get a lot of manuscripts where the use of language is so awkward or clich&eacute;d or error-filled, and the story so strange or difficult to follow or unsatisfying, that we can't imagine anyone publishing it. But we also have books submitted to us that we like, that we think are at least as good as many titles currently in the bookshops. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean we'll publish them. They have to be personal favourites of ours before one of us will devote half a year of our working life to bringing it to market. In other words, a rejection from Snowbooks is hardly a rejection at all.

Other things you might like to know about the people choosing not to publish your work are that several of us have hated nearly every Booker-prize-winning book that we've read. These are titles which have not only been commercial successes, but have been held up for special commendation by a panel of expert judges - and yet we didn't like them and if they'd been submitted to us, we probably wouldn't have published them. So again, you can see that a rejection from us is not necessarily a bad sign.

You probably also know the stories about authors such as Joanna Rowling and John Grisham being rejected by more than a dozen publishers - before going on to make some lucky company heaps and heaps of money. It certainly makes you wonder whether there are other authors who would have delighted millions if they hadn't given up after ten rejections.

What it comes down to is that publishing companies aren't really the people you want reviewing your work. If you think about it, we have a financial incentive to put as little thought and effort into sifting through submissions as possible. We've got a lot of submissions to get through and not enough time. Plus, many publishers aren't looking to take any chances with new material; they want obvious, commercial successes, ideally from authors with a track record. 

Snowbooks could hire a team of people whose job it is to give detailed constructive feedback to submitting authors and to point them in the direction of other publishers more attuned to their style, but there's no obvious way for us to make that idea profitable. We'd be spending money that other firms aren't and it wouldn't necessarily make us any more financially successful - and it's the same with any other publishers you'll deal with. We're like shoppers at a January sale: we grab the two or three things that catch our eye as quickly as we can and move on. We're not critics so much as opportunists.

Given that a submitted manuscript is inevitably an author's pride and joy, and that a book's acceptance and future fortunes are bound up with its author's own hopes and happiness, it's almost criminal that publishers get to accept or reject submissions with so little feedback or accountability. The best we can say at Snowbooks is that we think it's a bad situation, but we don't at the moment have a solution to it. 

In the meantime, all we can suggest is that you don't trust publishers. They're not your friends and they're not even that great at spotting what readers will like. If they reject your book it doesn't necessarily mean that there's anything wrong with it and, perhaps even more importantly, if they accept it, it doesn't mean that they love it and are going to treat it with respect. Many unpublished authors have a picture of how they'll be treated once they have a book in print that's much rosier than the reality - they're often disappointed to learn that most publishing is, after all, just a business. 

Obviously, we wouldn't be painting such a bleak picture of publishing if we didn't aim to be different; we do. But we're limited at the moment in that we're new and poor. So please accept our apologies for replying with an open letter to a submission that must have taken months or maybe years of effort and energy to produce - and let us wish you better luck in the future.

Snowbooks</em>

So, there you have it. Publishers are looking for opportunities to make money. But let's home in for a moment on that crucial, magical, hard to explain singular moment of certainty: of knowing, without a doubt, that the submission we've just read is a book we want to publish. How does that happen? 

I can break it down into three main areas. Firstly, whether the book fits with the aims that we've already spent time and effort thinking through. Anna and I have decided that our all-time favourite categories of fiction are historical fiction, horror, supernatural thrillers and general fiction. If Bravo Two Zero or Bridget Jones' Diary were submitted to us, it's not very likely that we'd have seriously consider them.

Secondly, basic quality. I'm not the sort of person who can forgive errors. My eye doesn't skip over bad punctuation, bad grammar, clunky sentences. I can't think 'oh, we can tidy that up later'. Polish is important. 

Thirdly, my physiological reaction to it. I mean it. Reading and selecting from submissions is exhausting because when I find a book that's for me, I go through a similar process to falling in love. I read it in one or two sittings - everything else in the world stands still. When I get to the end, I feel a sense of loss, a sadness that it's over. I think about it for the rest of the day. I think about it for the rest of the week. I can't get it out of my head. It plays on me. I worry about it. I worry that Anna and Rob won't like it as much as I do. The characters get bigger in my head. Everything reminds me of it. I worry that the author will turn out to be a nightmare. I worry that someone else will make an offer and if I'm not quick I will lose the opportunity. I fret. And then when we've agreed the deal, I'm full of optimism and hope, dancing around, making plans, getting on with the cover design, planning the future. And once it's created and out there in the world, I get an enormous burst of pride for it when I see it on the tables in store. It's proper love: it's the best feeling in the world.  

How do you tailor a book to make sure that's my reaction? Well, you just can't. It's purely subjective and it's not something you can guarantee. You just have to write an immaculate book with flawless style that I love. And you can also imagine that sometimes, for no good reason, perfectly excellent writing doesn't spark this extreme reaction. Publishing is both an art and a science: get the science bit right and you're a good deal of the way there. The rest is alchemy - luck and magic.","","","","2007-06-24","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

Were it not for the U.S. Supreme Court deciding that counting all votes was somehow not the right thing to do, he'd have been President for at least four of the last seven years. People used to say of George W. Bush that he was someone you'd want to have a beer with. Well, personally, I'd infinitely prefer to have a coffee with Al Gore. I've never seen the name Ilya Prigogine in a newspaper before, let alone because a politician expressed fascination with his work. But I know who he is and why Gore would be interested in him. And I'd want a President who cares about the things Al Gore cares about, knows the things he knows and thinks the way Al Gore thinks. I particularly like the fact that he confesses that politics is too rigged and too irrelevant a game to waste any more of his life on. I can't wait to read his book <em>The Assault on Reason</em>, not just to learn his views, but to see if he'll come right out and say what a lot of crap most politics and most journalism is.</p> <p>He says he doesn't want to run, but how about they put his name on the ballot anyway? We're going to need a lot of people like him if we're going to save the planet and avert a global catastrophe. It really would be helpful if one of them was in charge of the U.S.A.</p>","","","","2007-06-24","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

<p>I thought I'd just say a little more about our strategery week. I'm covering some of the same ground as Em's earlier post, but also expanding on a few points. Personally, I always like hearing about why other companies do the things they do. It's a good way of clarifying one's own thinking. And often it's an excellent source of cheap laughs too.</p>","<p>So why are we shifting a bit more towards&nbsp;non-fiction and why are we planning to back it up with online community thingies? Well, it's partly about building on areas we think we're good at and partly about taking evasive action as we spot problems up ahead.</p> <p>For instance, I've blathered on at some length about how publishers are far from indispensable to the world of books and reading. Software is making it easier for authors to check and typeset their own work. They can produce an electronic copy of their book or send it off to print - all without our help. The technology to make that possible is only going to improve, becoming cheaper and more widespread - especially if e-readers become common. But self-publishing is only half the battle. How are readers going to hear about self-published work? And how will they know which of it they might like? </p> <p>Well, online communities of adventurous readers could easily filter and grade new writing. Some people like to be in the vanguard, reading the latest, newest writing, being the first to discover new talent. If a majority of those people ever congregate in online communities they could begin to take over one of the important functions that publishers and agents perform now: the first cut of wheat from chaff. Then less adventurous readers could pick and choose from what the reading vanguard recommend. Imagine a gradient of readers, from adventurous novelty-seekers to staid play-it-safers. If each group feeds back its views to online communities (even just choosing how many stars to give a book as they close their e-readers), anyone looking for a book to read will be able to get all the information and guidance they need without having to consult a retailer. And the retailers in turn won't need the publishers.</p> <p>Now like all these discussions it's important to say that it won't happen overnight, it won't happen equally across all genres&nbsp;and it won't be 100%. Just like mobile phones haven't replaced landlines - or even call boxes - most changes live alongside the alternatives rather than obliterating them. But they can still have major effects.</p> <p>Where is this change likely to happen first? In text-only single-author books and in communities that already exist on the web - especially in communities that already write for each other, like the world of craft blogs.</p> <p>Craft blogs also link to another important point. We've tried to make a policy of only publishing books we totally love. Now in fiction, quality can be very subjective, but in non-fiction, it's much easier bring in some objectivity. There's still a subjective element, but Em can say 'this is a good martial arts book' or Anna can say 'this is a good craft book' and because they're both experts in and members of the community they're selling to, they know what they're talking about. Publishing in areas where we're experts is likely to help us keep quality high and give us a much better grasp of what the demand is. It also speeds the process along. Em knows whether an author is using terms like 'centre-line' properly, just as Anna knows the difference between a cross stitch and a chain stitch - and which one she's looking at a photo of.</p> <p>Like so many of our ideas, this concept doesn't scale very well. We couldn't really put out three hundred titles a year using editors who are also experts in each of their titles, but the beauty is that we're not intending to scale up. Because we're self-funded, we have the option to stop at ten employees, or five or three. Whatever works best for us.</p> <p>And one more point to make about craft or martial arts books: think about self-publishing again. It's clearly easier to self-publish a novel than it is a four-colour title containing a thousand pictures. </p> <p>So by aiming to do more colour, non-fiction titles in areas we have personal expertise in and in which there already exist tight-knit communities (ideally online ones) we're ticking umpteen boxes when it comes to preparing for the future. We're operating in the areas best able to withstand the digital onslaught and we're simultaneously positioning ourselves to have a role should communities take over from the agent/publisher/retailer process of picking winners. We're also making it easier to keep quality high and to gauge demand more accurately. And finally, we're selecting&nbsp;titles we'll actually enjoy working on. What's not to like?</p>

<hr/>

<p style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">Update:</p>
<p>Re: Matthew's comment below. That's one of the points I should have mentioned. We're not intending to charge more, but we are intending to sell directly to the communities we're involved with. Since selling direct can easily triple the profit per book compared with selling through a big retailer, even if we only do a little of this it will be a big help.</p>","","","","2007-06-26","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

I don't like to blow my own trumpet (such a lie - of course I do) but not only have I found the time to be up to date with Every Single Last Thing, I have also revamped the website. ('Up to date', by the way, does not mean 'finished': it means 'under control', which is good enough for me.) Let me show you around.","So the first new thing is the <strong><a href=""http://snowbooks.com/catalogue.html"">catalogue. </a></strong> See the little portholes? Like catching a fleeting glimpse of the deliciousness beneath. And notice the new, sleek categorisation? In line with the strategy we've been talking about, our focus in fiction is general fiction, thrillers, historical fiction and gift; in non-fiction it's sports and fitness, crafts and general non-fiction. And Lo! The catalogue now reflects this. 

Then if you click through to each title page, you can see that there is a Google button to buy direct from here. Thank you so much for your wonderful comments on the Google vs. Paypal debate. It was split pretty much down the middle, so I decided to have <em>both</em> a Google and a paypal button - except Paypal doesn't let you add on delivery charges in the way I wanted, so I am going to shelve that idea and just go with Google. There's only so much time I can spend on this! The Google buttons are also on selected titles on the home page. 

And last but not least, did you notice the Free Books club over on the left there? (//update// Oh, it's only on the blog's main page. I'll try to figure out how to get it to work on the full page!//) That's right! Email me your name and address, on the understanding that I will keep those details on file and use them to send you updates on Snowbooks (but never sell or pass them on to others) and I will post you a free book! Yes! <strike>Tell me which book you'd like and I'll post it to you! </strike>For free! This is a karma-based promotion: the idea is that you'll think Snowbooks is so bloomin' great that you will feel it only just and proper to actually buy another book, or two. No obligation - but it would be very nice of you. //Update// I've revised this to limit it to a list of books, as I keep going out of stock in the office! Visit <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/freebooksclub.html"">the new page </a>for more info. ///

We've also revamped the submissions page a bit. We've actually changed the submissions email address to manuscripts[@]snowbooks.com because the spam on the submissions address was getting a bit daft. We've also changed our requirements slightly: there's no need for a synopsis but if you fancied having a bash at writing a blurb it would be quite good fun; we require the full manuscript; and you are also required to use the right naming convention in the email subject line. Nothing too onerous, really. <strong><a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/authors.html"">Take a look at the guidelines</a></strong> (well, cast-in-stone-rules, really) in full. 

That's about it, I think, for this brush-up, but there are lots more things to come, including the community pages we mentioned earlier. Ooh, so exciting! Oh, also I have to change the FAQs page later. If you have any thoughts on anything extra you'd like to see, do shout. And thanks again for all the comments - so useful.","","","","2007-06-27","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","8"
"40991","","1","The trick to liking ex-P.M. Blair","Publish","true","<img alt=""p.gif"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/p.gif"" width=""23"" height=""29"" />","I could almost be happy with what I think I'll call the Blair Presidency but for two things. The first is that you have to imagine that Labour lost the election in 1997 and Tony Blair was the Conservative party leader who came to power instead. Replace the elation with nervousness and replace expectation of labour policies with fear of a move further to the right. If Mr Blair had been a tory, I'd be looking back on this last decade thinking it could have been a lot worse. For a right-winger, he had the beginnings of a social conscience, and along with helping out big business and the already-rich, he also did quite a few favours for the rest of us.

The second thing you have to imagine is that two-thirds of the way through his tenure, Tony Blair <em>didn't</em> decide to help kill more than a hundred thousand civilians and then lie to us about it. Because in reality, it's just not one of those things you can set aside. You can't say, ""Apart from killing more women and children than most of us meet in a lifetime, would you say Tony Blair cares for people?"". ""Setting aside the fact he put us at the heart of an illegal war, would you say Tony Blair has the best interests of the country at heart?"" ""Excluding the time he lied in order to start a war, would you say Tony Blair was a trustworthy man?""

So, if you somehow imagine those two things were true - he was a Conservative premier who stayed out of the Coalition of the Willing - then, on balance, I'd be 'OK' with the Blair years. Lots to worry about, but quite a bit to celebrate too.

But since he said he wasn't a Conservative, I have to say it seems a little bit deceptive of him to govern so  like one, albeit a rather amiable one.

And since he <em>really did</em> use our taxes to blow up thousands of little kids in Iraq, nice man that he otherwise is, and modestly good leader that he's been, I really, really hope he ends up in prison for his horrible crimes. Otherwise what sense is there in having laws?","","","","2007-06-28","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

<p>It's a fraught and vex&eacute;d business: DRMs, IP and copyright. I find the idea of protecting creative work for a preposterous 75 years after the author's death to be, um, preposterous. As sharp-minded cynics have pointed out, every time Disney's earliest works are about go out of copyright, the term of protection is extended - which is why the U.S. Copyright Term Extension Act is also known as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. Does anyone really think that work done in 1923 should still be copyrighted until 2023? I thought this sort of thing was about incentives for investment, making sure people had a chance to profit from their work; but will people really stop creating fine new things if they can't be sure that their great-grandchildren will be able to live off the royalties? I doubt it. I think the opposite situation is more likely: if you really thought that three generations down the line your family would still be sponging off what you do now, you'd be too depressed to invent anything. I mean, isn't there something quite sad about the idea that singing Happy Birthday in public requires that a fee be paid, and even though the copyright is of a 1935 arrangement of a 1893 song, it will be 2030 before it can be sung for free. That, as they say in legal circles, is utter pants.</p>","<p>And speaking of inverse incentives, did you know that you're allowed to make a backup copy of any DVDs you own? Or rather, the rapacious IP lawyers who work for the massive media companies haven't yet come up with an argument to prevent it. Well, I made such a copy the other day - mainly because I'm a nerd. So I now own two copies of Hot Fuzz (for the older and more out of touch reader, that's not porn; it's comedy). And which one would I rather play? I would rather play the copy. And why, you ask? Because the software I used to make the copy offered to remove something called PUOs for me. PUOs are Prohibited User Operations. And now that they're gone, I can put the disc in a player and - when the endless legal warnings come up - I can jump past them to the film. That's right, I can thwart the justice system and watch the movie I paid for <em>straightaway</em>. Whereas the lawyers would normally require me&nbsp;to stare at threats of legal action for fifteen seconds first. And it lets me easily jump past the 'advert' telling me not to download pirate movies - you know, the one that equates illegally copying a movie with stealing a car or a handbag - presumably on the basis that every time someone copies a movie, someone else who bought a legal copy has to go without.</p> <p>I've blogged about the theory of this before, but I have to say the reality is intoxicating: putting a DVD on and having it start ten seconds after the drive door closes. No nagging, no threats, just the film I paid for. And, as one online pundit has asked, has anyone every successfully used as their defence, when charged with copyright violation, the fact that the legal warning at the start of the movie only appeared for one second instead of ten. Or to come at it another way, was it permissible to run off a few thousand copies of VHS movies and sell them, because you could claim you accidentally fast-forwarded past the copyright warnings.</p> <p>I suppose the thing that annoys me most is that I have to pay money to be nagged about piracy. If I just bought bootleg copies of things, I could enjoy movies in peace. As a marketing campaign, it targets only those people who don't need to hear it. And as part of a disc designed to entertain, a minute or so of copyright nagging leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p>You know when you're chatting to a group of people and you&nbsp;confess to some problem you thought was pretty common and then everyone looks at you blankly and you realise it's just you? You all know that feeling, right? No? Just me then.</p>","<p>Well I have no idea if this is a common problem - in fact I'm not even totally sure it <em>is</em> a problem, though it's undoubtedly an obstacle given the line of work I'm in. For twenty-five years I've read a novel a week, on average. Lots of it was trashy, but not all. I viewed every train ride as a golden opportunity to read and I'd get anxious at the thought of starting out on a journey only to find that my novel was still on the hall table. The idea that I'd be forced to look at pylons and people's back gardens instead of re-immersing myself in some fabulous story always felt like an important chance wasted, leading me to stuff two and sometimes three books into my bag to be on the safe side.</p> <p>Then about five years ago I started trying to do a bit of writing. I don't know if that's what triggered the change, but the timing is suspicious and I'm sure it's part of it. The more time I spent trying to put words together and figuring out what I did and didn't like at the level of sentences and paragraphs, the less fiction I read. A big part of it is that nowadays unless I'm reading something very fine indeed, I can't help but think 'I wouldn't have written <em>that</em>, I'd have written <em>this</em> instead'. Or then I'll think of some third alternative, and before you know it I'm writing not reading. And of course (as the observant reader will have spotted) it's not that I'm the most talented writer in the world; it's just that increasingly&nbsp; (to borrow from the world of the lay art critique) 'I know what I like'.</p> <p>Time was, when I finished every book I started, but I've abandoned more novels in the last five years than I've read. Some phrase will hit me like a wrong note in a song. Some hammy word choice or clumsy expression will jar and I'll just think 'I can't be bothered'.</p> <p>In case you think I've had it with the written word&nbsp;- which really would be a career-limiting development - I should say that I've compensated by filling the void with non-fiction - oodles of it. For some reason that I don't understand, reading for me has become like that game where you thread a loop of wire round a bent coat-hanger, trying not to make contact and set off an annoying buzzer. Inexplicably, non-fiction is like a neurosurgeon, nimbly able to get from start to finish without a hitch, whereas most novels are lurching drunks with bad hiccups.</p> <p>But I don't think it's all about hyper-sensitivity on my part; it also seems to be a lack of motivation. I can't decide if it's just that I'd rather learn something than entertain myself - because undoubtedly that can get addictive once you get past your boredom threshold. Factor in that I watch more movies than ever and it doesn't seem that I've gone off storytelling. But for whatever reason, I just don't care enough to get more than a few pages into most novels. And just to remind you, this is after a quarter-century of effortless, marathon-style, novel reading.</p> <p>Thankfully I still find fiction from earlier eras quite palatable. I can read Victorian literature without my interest flagging. Re-reading some Austen went well. Gulliver's Travels was fabulous. It's something about the quaintness of the language, maybe, that lets it slip past my hyper-active fiction allergy. </p> <p>And this problem doesn't stop me writing fiction or reading back what I've written.</p> <p>But what if it gets worse? What if, eventually, fiction from all eras is a problem? It's a worst-case scenario, but somewhere up ahead I fear joining&nbsp;a club populated largely by footballers and Big Brother alumni. With them it's <em>all</em> books - and I'm not quite that bad - but I worry that a time will come when I write more novels than I read. That can't be healthy, can it?</p>

<p>I'm trying to remember back to my very first school history lessons, when I was eleven. I'm trying to recall the first event in history as far as my profoundly-English teachers were concerned. I'm pretty sure it was 1066, The Norman Conquest. Once we'd covered that, I vaguely remember trying to memorise a few features of the feudal system and being confused as to why the serfs agreed to it. Then there was something called the Corn Laws, which were later repealed. I also remember how important it was to choose the right form of crop rotation, but had no idea what end products such crops might produce. Was flax anything to do with ajax or weetabix? Was barley used for something other than the making of barley sugars?</p>","<p>Of course teaching history to kids is always going to be an uphill struggle, because history is a secondary subject: it is based on other, more basic disciplines. That's not to denigrate it. You could instead say it is, by its nature, an advanced subject. At age eleven I was being taught about previous forms of government, without really having any idea about the one I was living under. I was being taught about historic shifts in economics, long before I knew which kind of economy modern Britain had. I knew nothing about psychology - or even the motivations of grown-ups - and yet I was trying analyse the deeds of the 'good' and 'bad' kings. I suppose the fundamental problem is this: you might be able to memorise a lot of history as a child, but if you actually understand it, then mentally at least, you're not a child any more.</p> <p>If we'd had a bit longer to go back over the entire sweep of human history, one place we might have chosen as our starting point would have been Mesopotamia. Now, you might recall that 'hippopotamus' means 'river horse' in ancient Greek, and that the Mesolithic is the middle stone-age, so with a bit of cutting and pasting, we can work out that Mesopotamia means 'between the rivers'. And then, with a bit more head-scratching, we might be able to work out that those two rivers are probably&nbsp;the Tigris and the Euphrates. And as far as lots of clever people are concerned, that's where 'civilisation' started.</p> <p>In Mesopotamia, are the remains of the city of Ur. It's a good candidate for being the first human city. It's at least five thousand years old, which is old enough that despite being located in the middle of a desert, when it was built it was actually a sea-port. Incredibly, one of its great monuments is still standing: the Ziggurat of Ur. It's over four thousand years old, and gives the Egyptian Pyramids a good run for their money in terms of antiquity.</p> <p>I find it difficult to conceive of human beings not living in towns, not building in stone: a time when the whole human race was nomadic, a time before settled agriculture, when you had to be able to travel with everything you owned. Humans were biologically, mentally the same as now, and yet almost everything about their lifestyle was different. A world with no writing, no houses, no farms - but plenty of people - is difficult to imagine. But then came farms, then came houses, and in Ancient Mesopotamia, the change-over to modernity began.</p> <p>And it's thanks to places like Ur, that I often can't get very excited about British archaeology. I mean, how impressed should I be when Time Team are excavating Saxon hovels built three-thousand years after the Sumerians had put this together:</p> <div style="" width: 150px; margin-left: 20px;""><a href=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/zigbig.html"" onclick=""window.open('http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/zigbig.html','popup','width=960,height=720,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false""><img alt=""zigthumb.jpg"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/zigthumb.jpg"" width=""148"" height=""111"" />

<p>And now we've reached the point in this post where you might like to stop reading. There's a modern addendum to the history of Ur and it's not a happy one. </p> <p>I'm sure anyone who's ever been saddened at the thought of pollution eating away at the Colosseum or been embarrassed when they learned of early British 'archaeologists' rummaging through the contents of the pyramids as though they were at a jumble sale, will agree that Humanity's First City is a fairly important piece of heritage. So you might be surprised to learn that the Great Ziggurat of Ur is now inside a U.S. military base. The walls are showing damage from shrapnel hits and the Ziggurat itself is directly under the base's flightpath and so is subject to constant vibration. One of the archaeological sites near the Ziggurat has already been concreted over to make a blockhouse. Connoisseurs of irony will find much to savour in the idea that a mission to bring Western Civilisation to the Middle East is actually destroying the birthplace of that civilisation and that the first city on Earth is now a military base.</p>","","","","2007-07-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"
"40999","","1","Not so much politics as just a rant: the Libby pardon: updated","Publish","true","<img alt=""p.gif"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/p.gif"" width=""23"" height=""29"" />","So, when President Clinton lied under oath about being unfaithful to his wife, it was a genuine crime, but when Vice President Cheney's assistant lied under oath about one of the dirty tricks used to start a war, it's a technicality?

If you're the Vice President and someone points out that you're peddling information that you know to be false, what do you do? You arrange for your critic's wife to lose her job, of course. And if the man's wife happens to be an undercover C.I.A. agent, no matter. And if she's actually working to track WMDs - which you say is one of the most serious problems the world faces - who cares? And if this man, whose wife you targeted, was only telling the truth, it doesn't matter. And if the truth he was telling was that Iraq didn't acquire any nuclear material and the White House knows that full well, that won't stand in your way. And even though the President is using the existence of this fictional nuclear material to sell the country a war, that shouldn't stop you. Get the man's wife fired and then when an investigation is launched into how an undercover C.I.A. operative's name got into the papers, lie about it. Tell everyone to lie. Have your people lie about who leaked the operative's identity and if they get called to testify under oath, have them lie some more. And if they're caught in a lie and put on trial, no problem, the President can step in at the last moment, just as they're about to be sent to jail and waive their sentence, just fine them instead. Because after all it was a technicality. Not like lying about an affair. That's serious.

(Plus who knows what someone used to a life of luxury and ease might decide to offer up after a few months in prison. He might want to cut a deal. Couldn't have that.)

<p style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">Update:</p>

I thought maybe I should say a little more about why I was making a big fuss over this. I didn't just read it in the paper this week; I've been following the story for a couple of years. The Libby trial grew out of Special Counsel Fitzgerald's investigation into how an undercover agent came to be named in the mainstream press. For a long time, it was the only sign that America's system of checks and balances still existed. And the exciting thing about it was that an investigator with 'plenary' powers was on the trail of a scandal that could result in collapse of this awful presidency. Scooter Libby was lying under oath for a reason, and it clearly wasn't to protect himself, since he was the one going to jail. And he wouldn't be lying to protect a junior. Since he reported directly to V.P. Cheney, it's pretty clear who he was shielding. 

If Libby had told the truth in order to get out of jail, I think it would have quickly led to impeachment proceedings for the current leadership. And while I understand the arguments about not rocking the boat, I think that if there's a legal way to end this toxic presidency ahead of next year's elections, America and the world will be better off. But now President Bush has made it clear he'll just pardon anyone who gets into trouble lying on his behalf, so prosecuting his crimes has just become an even more formidable challenge. And the thread of possibility I've been following for two years appears to have simply run out, leading to nothing more than another soon-to-be-forgotten P.R. fiasco for the President.","","","","2007-07-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

Some bits and pieces:
- I just helped put my old sofa into a van. It's on its way to the Snowbooks office. For Em to sit on while she reads. For guests to relax on. For Em's cats to snooze upon if she ever brings them into work","- We recently bought both a Dymo handheld label-maker and a label printer that plugs into the computer and prints out little sticky address labels and such like. How much more organised will we feel once everything is labelled. There's been a bit of impulsive, spoof labelling going on, but hopefully that will die down soon. Publicly you might say you don't see what we're making a fuss about, but secretly you wish you had a label-maker too.

- Having been a bit disappointed with the other banks we've tried, we're moving over to Coutts. So far, they've been fabulous. And because they're so posh, we've had considerable fun pretending that 'bullion' is now one of the payment methods we accept. And pretending to fill in forms that say 'tick here if you would like a copy of your bank statement to be sent to your private island'.

- When I visit Anna in Minneapolis, I sometimes think it would be great to run into Neil Gaiman who lives in that part of the world. He's an interesting author who I'm sure I'd get a kick out of talking to. So I was pretty surprised when someone pointed out that I was at school with him for four years. I had no idea. I must have walked past him a thousand times, and I never thought to ask about the books he'd one day write.","","","","2007-07-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I just bought the thing in the picture. Well, the third that's nearest the camera, at any rate.

My old flat was made of chipboard and plasterboard and fiberboard and glue, and five years ago it was a bit of derelict ground. My new house has stone walls that are two feet thick and was built a couple of hundred years ago. Something about spending several hundred thousand pounds seems to require a bit of permanence, at least to my way of thinking.","","","","","2007-07-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

Andy and I had a lovely time this weekend at Roni Jay's house in Devon. I think it's Devon. Near Newton Abbot - that's Devon, right? We camped, which we both thought was quite brave and it turned out it wasn't horrible at all. The weekend came about because Hazel was inspired to gather us together for a Richard Craze Memorial Camping Weekend. Good old Rich was clearly about, somewhere, making sure it all went smoothly - his three young sons are absolutely charming and delightful and the weather was glorious. Great fun was had by all. 

A word, though, on tents. In the olden days, I did the Duke of Edinburgh's award - all of them, even Gold, because of the promise of my character being built. They made us lug the most phenomenally heavy trangias, food, clothes, boots,sleeping bags and tent up and down hills in foul weather. It was horrific, and if my character developed at all it was purely on the neuroses front. Modern tents, it turns out, are light as a feather and a cinch to put up. I bet they existed even when I was doing DofE. Grr. 

In other news - you couldn't make up what just happened to me and a SIM card. Suffice to say I pinged it so far across the room I didn't see where it landed and had to spend five valuable minutes hunting for it. It was in a coffee cup.","","","","2007-07-09","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

OK folks, this is your seven-day warning. Next week I am on Admin Holiday! It's a new, *exciting* sort of a holiday whereby I will still be in the office, but I won't be doing anything other than typesetting and cover design. I need to get a whole bunch of books off to the printer in time for Christmas and at this rate it's just not going to happen. Hence my brilliant new Admin Holiday invention.

So if you email, or phone, I probably won't reply to you until Monday 23rd. If it's really, really urgent please mark the email 'Really Really Urgent'. 

Or, alternatively, bombard me this week with your queries.","","","","","2007-07-09","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

There's a great review of The Human War <a href=""http://ellissharp.blogspot.com/2007/07/noah-cicero-human-war.html"">here which compares and contrasts it to <em>Saturday</em>. </a> Do read it, it's fascinating. 

""A satirical anti-war masterpiece. A study of the condition of a contemporary underclass. A working class classic. A hugely engaging read. A novel that will be read in one hundred years time, long after all that corporate liberal stuff has long since been forgotten.""

Last century we outgrew all sorts of constraints on what a person could do. We recognised that you shouldn't hold someone back on the basis of gender or race or class or religion. And we also lost faith in political leaders, as well as many religious leaders. And the rock-n-roll era through to the Eighties taught us that the previous generation don't always have our best interests at heart either. The early 21st century added business leaders to the list of moral casualties. And then turned a number of leading politicians from targets of scepticism into something approaching Bond villains. We've got rid of all the bad, old rules governing how we should behave and we've lost our respect for anyone who might provide us with a new set. I thought the loss of our moral compass had been absolute, but I was still slightly surprised and disappointed to read about Blue Peter being <a href=""http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,2122574,00.html"">fined </a>because they announced a fake winner to a competition they were having technical problems with. I could be wrong, but it looks very much like Blue Peter engaged in the dreaded 'spin' to me. That's to say, the truth would have created the wrong sort of impression so they faked up something that showed them in a better light. I'm pretty sure that in the Blue Peter of my youth, Peter Purves would have said 'Well, we seem to be having a bit of trouble with our competition,"" and then John Noakes would have laughed his head off. The only consolation is that in an age of spin, the truth always comes out after a while and makes the spinners look bad. So wiser not to do it in the first place, surely?","","","","2007-07-10","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Phew. Moving house is hard work. And I haven't even done the lifting and loading and packing/unpacking yet. I'm still just phoning around talking to people who tell me impossible things, which I then have to talk them out of before I can get my move sorted. For instance, my removal people say it will take five hours for four people to load my stuff into a van... even though I did it in about that time without help before. And believe me, I'm not fast at carrying both ends of a mattress all by myself. But the disparity, I'm told, comes from the fact that they pack the van so much more carefully than I would have done. Riiigghhht.","Then I spoke to Orange, who had processed my change of address (hooray!) but couldn't help me with my other query which related to a recent upgrade I'd arranged via the Carphone Warehouse. I was told that no such upgrade existed, Carphone Warehouse would never have cold-called me to arrange such an upgrade, and that I must have been dealing with some third-party who were deceiving me. Wow. The fact that this third-party had sent me an Orange phone and sim card, and then updated my records on the Orange database cut no ice. They must have a 'contact' at Orange I was told. Very surreal and unsettling, and it took fifteen minutes of reasoning to get them to answer the question I was asking - and even then I had to replace the name 'Carphone Warehouse' with the name 'Orange' so that the lady I was speaking to would believe me.

Then I talked to BT who told me that there was no spare capacity in the wiring that links the area I'll be living in to the local exchange, so there was no way for me to have a phone line until they could free up some wires. To be fair, they were incredibly nice about it, but it was still a little difficult to accept. I asked why the existing wiring couldn't be used, but was told there was no record of a phone at that address. Funny, the same thing happened when I moved into my last place, and then, just as now, in arranging to buy the place I'd actually spoken to the previous owner on his nonexistent phone line. So, eventually I tracked down the actual phone number of the previous owner and made the case that if the last tenant had been making calls from that address only last week, then the wires were very probably still attached to the telephone poles and perhaps I could make use of them too. It took several hours of calls - and we had to book an engineer to visit the house - and then cancel the booking - and then make and cancel it again - but we got there in the end.

Yes, it's all been very difficult. Not to mention eye-wateringly, wooze-makingly expensive. And I've come to see this long struggle as nothing less than a conflict between competing ideologies. I just have to <em>believe</em> strongly enough that a house move is possible while all about try to persuade me that such a thing can never be. The trouble is that occasionally I find my faith weakening. Perhaps there is no wiring. Perhaps I have so many boxes of books that no mere removal firm can ever shift them. Perhaps fraudsters really do hand out new mobile phones for free as part of some strange, loss-making scam. But then I think of the screaming mopeds and thumping bass of North Woolwich, and I picture the tiny little ponies who live in the field next to my new house, and once again my bloodyminded resolve to move is renewed.","","","","2007-07-11","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

I hate people who use their blogs just to grumble. At the very least they should either be funny about it or have a good point to make. But because all I'm doing at the moment is organising my house move I'm experiencing a lot more frustration than I know what to do with. It's either share it via the SnowBlog or leave it in my brain to rankle. So, here's the impossible problem I was grappling with this morning:","Delays with my house move mean I can't fly out to Portugal for a family get together when I'd like to. I've got a return flight booked, but I won't be ready to go in time, so I've had to buy an extra one-way ticket to go out a day and a half later. I still want to use the return part of my old ticket, which on something like a train would be fine. But it doesn't work like that with British Airways. If I fly out with them, there's no problem. But if I leave my seat empty on the way out, I can only use my return ticket if I pay extra - a lot extra: nearly double in fact. It's part of the weird world of air travel. Where singles are more expensive than returns. And a trip such as flying from Chicago to London via Minneapolis is a lot cheaper than booking the same seat starting at Minneapolis. By way of consolation, the friendly BA lady explained that I could drop the second leg of my journey but not the first. In other words, if I fly out with them, they won't charge me extra if I don't want to come back. How generous.

P.S. Also, how on earth do people with actual proper jobs move house? I'm spending all day everyday making calls, packing boxes, sending letters and driving stuff around. There's no way I'd have another forty or fifty hours a week to spend in an office. Do people with normal jobs just have to stay in the same house for life? Or do they move at night?","","","","2007-07-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Ooh, it's announcement central here today. 

Read a new interview with Deep Hanging Out author Richard Gywn on <a href=""http://www.abebooks.com/docs/authors-corner/richard-gwyn.shtml"">Abe Books. </a> We are launching the mass market paperback edition in September with a lovely new cover - more as it comes.","","","","","2007-07-13","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

I've said it before: Snowbooks isn't a 'scalable' business. If you haven't sat in as many corporate 'stradegy' meetings as I have*, you may not think much about scalability. But it's a big deal to a lot of investors and business planners. To my mind, retail chains are the ultimate in scalability, because if you can clone a particular shop a thousand times then you make a thousand times as much in sales, with a lot less than a thousand times the costs. I'm not saying it's commendable, just that the economics stack up nicely.","We've already talked about how having our editors only work on subjects they're already experts in and/or contributors to wouldn't work if we wanted to hire a big team and put out five hundred titles a year. Well, we've just encountered another limiting factor on our growth: our picky-picky perfectionism. 

Recently we had a networking sort of job to do (the people kind, not the computer kind) and, not having the right experience in-house, we allowed ourselves to be talked into getting some third-party help. Time went by, currency changed hands, and eventually we had an opportunity to see what we'd got for our money.

Eeeek. It turns out we've accidentally paid quite a bit of money to spread around the idea that Snowbooks is run by slow-witted plodders with no sense of aesthetics. At least that's the impression we'd get if we were on the receiving end of it. We'd hoped for something imaginative, something creative, something all-together more impressive to be done in our name. More Ellen Macarthur, less Jade Goody. But, to return to my original point, that's one of the problems with our kind of business. We have the luxury of getting things right - refining what we do until we're happy with it. And when we hire someone, it's not because they're good, it's because they're fabulous. And naturally there's a limited number of people like that. Or to put it another way, not everyone is above average. Which means there are plenty of people to whom you can't just say: create something original and amazing.

All of which puts me in mind of a revelation that dawned on me after a few years in retail. A big retail chain can easily employ ten thousand people and you can't expect them all to have mesmeric people skills and think like rocket scientists. Neither could you afford to pay them if they did. So in a truly scalable business, the trick is not just to get the job done; it's to get the job done with ordinary people. Now *that's* where the real management skills come in. Management skills we don't have and don't expect to develop. And to be honest, we'd much rather cheat and only hire miracle workers.

So Saturday so far has been spent proofreading. Question: how the hell do proofreaders earn a living? It takes hours and hours and hours. Maybe they just do it badly.  

Next observation: Dr Who. I don't miss it. When Buffy finished I was quite despondent for a week; when The West Wing finished I think I cried. Admittedly those shows were never coming back, and Dr Who will return in a matter of months. But I had got to the point where I approached each Saturday night's episode with dread, wondering what Russell T Davies had done this week to turn anticipation into disappointment. 

I know, I know. It's only TV. But good TV, like writing, matters. A bit, at least. 

Back to my manuscript.","","","","","2007-07-14","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

I've never been married and from time to time drunk friends have cornered me and explained 'what my problem is'. Personally, I've always suspected - as with so much in life - it's simply a matter of proper motivation. Which is why the possible Tory initiative offering a &pound;20 per week tax incentive to encourage the institution of marriage has intrigued me. Now I'm sure if you're in a relationship with someone you're not sure you love, &pound;20 per week will be just what you need to nudge you towards matrimony, but in my case I'd have to do a lot more than just set a date; I'd have to select someone to marry, probably get to know them first, perhaps overcome the opposition of her friends and family, and then persuade her it was a good idea. In other words, it's likely to be a lot of effort and frankly I don't think &pound;20 per week is going to cover it.","I might not agree with many Tory policies, and I might view with dread the way they crib loathsome initiatives from the American Right and tentatively float them in Britain to see if they can be used to bypass voters' higher mental functions in the same way on this side of the Atlantic. But I have to admit I'm finally warming to them. Make it &pound;250 per week, and I'll seriously consider voting Conservative. I know people say you have to work at a marriage, but under the right Tory plan that's the only work I'd need to do. And how hard can marriage be when even the dimmest and laziest of celebrities can romp through half a dozen of them in a lifetime. So come on Conservatives; offer to put a little more money behind this important policy and I might be prepared to become a Tory. Though I hope you'll understand that, because of my political beliefs, I'd rather not marry one.","","","","2007-07-14","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"
"41022","","1","Encircled - U.S. politics","Publish","true","<img alt=""p.gif"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/p.gif"" width=""23"" height=""29"" />","Britain often emulates America. We copy its hottest ideas, though by the time they've crossed the Atlantic, many of them are barely luke warm. And we share many of its problems. Two hundred and fifty years ago, America was our provincial outpost; now we're its, and our attempts to emulate the U.S. often produce results that are small and a little bit pathetic compared with the original. 

Of course, if the thing we're copying is a problem, then smaller is better. For instance, we've had an Attorney General who will deliberate over matters of law and then conclude whatever he was told to conclude. America has had an Attorney General who sees the Department of Justice as a sort of enforcement arm for the Republican Party. He's fired supposedly independent U.S. Attorneys who didn't follow Republican policy and hired others whose only qualification seems to be that they do. Of course he didn't do that on his own initiative, and now that the House of Representatives has a Democrat majority, a number of its members have the power to find out who was pulling his strings.

Well, they would have the power, but they've hit a little snag. Firstly, the President has dropped some pretty strong hints with his 'pardoning' of Scooter Libby, that he'll also pardon anyone else who gets into trouble protecting him. That's problem number one: there's little point in investigating people if convictions mean nothing. And of course the other problem is that it's the Department of Justice who'd prosecute anyone found to have behaved improperly - and they're the ones under investigation. So, whatever Congress uncovers, the DoJ won't necessarily take anyone to court and if they did the President has shown himself ready to step in and let them off the hook.

Bad enough, but the other farce that's going on is that witnesses aren't even turning up to testify. Why not? Well, to pick up on something that <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/07/not_politics_so_much_as_just_a.html#more"">KatherineC  commented about</a> (click and scroll down), the President is claiming 'executive privilege' and extending it to anyone involved. Executive Privilege is a curtain of discretion for hiding sensitive matters from Congress - temporarily. In the past it's been used when divulging the details of exactly what the executive branch (= the White House) is up to would jeopardise delicate negotiations or reveal state secrets. Now President Bush is using it to derail the beginnings of a criminal enquiry. And what is particularly spectacular about this abuse is that he says the White House wasn't involved in the dodgy hiring and firing of U.S. Attorneys. That's to say, he's attempting to use a rule that allows him to hide the deliberations of the executive branch while simultaneously claiming that the executive branch weren't involved.

Who knows how it will turn out, but currently witnesses aren't turning up to testify because they've been told by the President that they're protected by Executive Privilege. When they fail to appear, the Department of Justice is hinting that it won't bother prosecuting them for contempt. And even if it did, the President has shown he's not afraid to pardon them.

All this goes, way, way beyond anything President Nixon ever did. It's actually so corrupt and barefaced you couldn't even make a movie about it because it wouldn't be believable. 

The human race is facing catastrophe if we don't correct the changes we're causing to the climate - and the most influential country in the world is fomenting hate, disrupting international accord, starting wars - not to mention being run into the ground - by the most corrupt president in history. To my way of thinking, this is not ideal.","","","","2007-07-16","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

So this is my week of no admin. Hah. I really don't think it's going to be possible. Already I have 50 unanswered emails, 3 major things to do for retailers, PAYE to pay, queries to answer, customers to chase, tax forms to complete, bills to pay, and it's 8.59 on Monday morning. Well, we'll see. 

Before I 'go dark', as the Seawolf class submarine did on The West Wing rerun last night, here is a lovely going on holiday present for you. Buy a copy of Virginia Woolf's The London Scene for &pound;2 (&pound;4 overseas) or five copies for &pound;7.50 anywhere in the world! Yes, it's a real bargain. So bargainy, it barely covers the postage, but I have lots of stock so need to get it moving. Roll up, roll up.

Rob has just phoned to ask whether I know what bat droppings look like. Fortunately I keep on hand at all times a copy of <a href=""http://crowonthehill.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.direct/purchaseproduct/orderproduct/customerselectproduct/searchproducts.aspx?descriptionSearch=Animal+Tracks+And+Signs"">Animal Tracks and Signs</a>, vended to me by the lovely <a href=""http://crowonthehill.tbpcontrol.co.uk/TBP.Direct/CustomerAccessControl/Home.aspx?d=crowonthehill&s=C&r=10000134"">Bookseller Crow on the Hill</a>, so I was able to tell him that ""they somewhat resemble mouse droppings, but can be distinguished by the fact... that they consist exclusively of finely divided insect remains"". He asked because this is Day Two in his new countryside home, where there is no internets, a bad phone reception and bats who come in through his top window and poo on the floor. Although that sounds less than ideal, he appears to be happier than I've heard him for a long time, and the country air - and friendly, non-scummy neighbours - appear to be suiting him down to the ground. He has the most wonderful views around his new barn, which he'll no doubt post as soon as he gets BT to lay four miles of cable (no joke). 

I imagine not having access to the web is like having an eye poked out. Brave, brave Rob. And who will upload the cute little pictures on my blog posts?","","","","","2007-07-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

It is dark as night here and is tipping it down. Is the fact that there seem to be five times as many police out with their sirens on somehow related? Are the sirens pressure-sensitive, like car alarms, and go off if they're pelted with heavy rain? Or do the police have to respond to call-outs about torrential downpours?

Also, how the hell am I going to get any lunch? 

So many questions.","","","","","2007-07-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Leila Johnston, author of our forthcoming (in October) sure fire bestselling hit million copy supernova gift book <a href=""http://snowbooks.com/web9781905005758.html"">How To Worry Friends and Inconvenience People</a>, clears up the situation in this short film. 

This is the first of a collection of videos which we'll be hosting here and elsewhere to showcase the excellent advice and tips to be found in the book. For instance, Leila suggests saying your mobile phone number when you answer it. Or measuring the difficulty of games and puzzles in units of the cubic rube. She wonders whether you could address a letter to a pillarbox, or whether you could try looking through a different person's window each day of advent.  Maybe using the comments section of someone else's blog to start your own hypotaxical micro-blog? And so on.

...about Harry Potter. But it will be brief. I don't really feel any differently towards HP than I do towards the dozens of other books which sell more than 100,000 copies a year. They are all in the same group in my mind: big, obvious, mass market books. They neither affect us positively nor negatively: they are Other, a different business model, a different experience, a different scale of publishing. Sure, we get hits from time to time, but a hit for us is 50,000 copies. And they are children's books, and we don't publish children's. (Yes, I know they're crossover, but editorially they're a genre we don't publish within.) So I don't really have any feelings, as an indie publisher - like whether it's good for business, bad for business, good for audience - about the books whatsoever.","And that is all. I can't say anything about my perceptions of their literary quality as I've never read any of them. But if you're partaking, I hope that everyone has a lot of fun tonight!

//Update, close to Saturday lunchtime.//

I may not be a HP fan, but my husband is. He pre-ordered online. It's 11am on the Saturday, and he was really looking forward to spending today reading the book - and now today is nearly half-way through. I know the Royal Mail have 600,000 parcels to deliver, but bloody hell, they've known about it for at least three years. Typical. 

I'll let you know when it finally arrives. Bet it's Monday. 

//Update 2 - mid afternoon.//

I got on my bike and went to get one from the local bookshop. Should have done that anyway in the first place! He is now up to page 84 and is mute, so I trust it's a good un.","","","","2007-07-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

Day three into his new home, ten foot shy of the highest point in the Cotswolds, and what happens? Rob's new house got flooded. Absolutely not fair. And he doesn't even have the internet to find out local phone numbers. He is quite chipper, considering, but I feel utterly rotten for him. 

His garden slopes slightly downwards to the house, and is contained on three sides by sturdy brick walls. When all the rains fell, the water didn't have a chance to drain, so whooshed down the hill and overpowered the doorstep (which is more like a door-recess). 

Andy and I are going to visit him tomorrow with emergency provisions and mops. I may get him to hand-write a blog post that I can then retype, like they used to do in the olden days. You know, when men would give dictation to their secretaries who would then type up their, er, blog posts. I'm sure it was something along those lines. 

Kind and supportive words would be appreciated so I can pass them on to Rob tomorrow, like a sort of word-based Red Cross parcel.","","","","","2007-07-21","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

So I half-succeeded with Admin Week. I have finished one book, done a first draft of two, got the lovely printers to scan the US edition of another, sent two to the authors (hello!) for proofing, and put aside time in August for the last. Combined with the fact that Anna is a force of nature and has practically finished all her Christmas books (except one biggie) we are storming! 

Admin week was, therefore, a good idea. However, I found that I *Just Can't Leave* my intray alone. By Tuesday I was totally panicked about the things piling up - and with bills to pay, stock to manage, retailers to talk to and cover designs to do for other publishers whose turnaround is always tight, I couldn't just sit on things for a week. So because it wasn't properly admin-free, I am going to roll the whole exercise over to next week and try to keep the admin to a minimum for another few days. 

Makes you wonder what would happen if I just went on holiday and didn't do a single thing, though. I bet no major problems would arise. It's all in my head. 

Also - the appearance of little icons on my previous blog posts suggests that Rob has gone round to the neighbours and borrowed a cup of internet. Hooray!","","","","","2007-07-21","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Well, anyone who's been fretting for my safety and wellbeing will be glad to know that life in The Countryside isn't going too badly, all things considered. It's true I had standing water in two of my bedrooms (they're on the ground floor) and my hallway, but somehow it doesn't seem to have been the foul sewer water that the poor unfortunates on the TV news have to contend with. No, Cotswold Spring Water invaded my new home and seems to have done very little damage at all. Granted the smell of damp is getting stronger, but if the insurance people happen to send someone with bunged-up sinuses, I'm going to struggle to prove that there ever was flooding here.","How I could have had a flooded ground floor when I'm so near the top of a big hill is a mystery my lovely neighbours have helped me unravel. The converted barn I'm living in was part of a working farm twenty-five years ago and, naturally, it had a farmyard. When turning farmyard into garden, corners were very likely cut and somewhere under my lawn is probably impermeable stone where there should be porous earth. That, plus the fact that the lowest point of my garden is just outside my front door are the culprits. In normal, non-climate-change weather, the gaps between paving stones are enough to drain away rain water. But in the once-in-a-century weather that the BBC pointed out is happening most years now, the dip outside my door filled with ten inches of water and came in through the walls.

One of the reasons I'm not too stressed about it is due to the support of my new neighbours. Knowing that I don't have a fridge yet, and would be unable to get to the shops with all the nearby roads impassable, the retired couple to one side of me brought round a cool box, complete with a couple of freezer blocks, which contained milk, butter and fresh, locally-laid eggs. I already had bread, so once I'd dried myself out from wading around in the deluge setting up hose pipes to siphon the water into the drains, I was able to have scrambled eggs on toast and a nice hot cup of tea. For those who take an interest in that sort of thing, yesterday I scrambled the Burford Browns for my tea; today it was Cotswold Legbars. Very nice too.

The neighbours on the other side have offered me the use of their washing machine and have hooked me up to their broadband connection (while I wait for BT to arrange the laying of some cables). That in particular has helped restore normality because going without e-mail, internet-sourced news and the ability to read my favourite blogs was slightly more distressing than watching water lap across my hall.

Anyway, it's only Day Five of living in the countryside, but so far I'd have to say it makes London look like an ugly, hostile and unhealthy place. Which I suppose it probably is.","","","","2007-07-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

We were going to go to see Rob today, but *someone* was worried that the floodwaters would magically rise again and so we decided not to chance it. Bah. No sense of adventure, have *some people*. Anyway, I got an extra special lunch out of it, and we'll go to see Rob next weekend instead - even if the countryside is on fire or part of the ocean by then. 

So today has been spent, well, working. Nothing like a lovely bit of work. Anyway, miracles have been achieved and a book I started at 8am yesterday is now completely and utterly finished. Booyah. Admittedly, a previous me shopped all the images about 6 months ago, so it just needed gluing together, but still. Big tick. 

Ooh, West Wing in ten minutes. Just time for a nice cup of tea and a sit down. See you next week. Oh. Tomorrow.","","","","","2007-07-22","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

[Not sure if this counts as politics]
Lately I've spent a lot more time than usual in the car. Which means I've heard more Radio 4 than usual. The other day I got bored listening to a segment about politicians who had smoked a joint twenty or more years ago, so I turned on some music. When I came back twenty minutes later they were still talking about MPs who had 'taken drugs' in their youth.","Now I know I'm far from the only one to notice this, but try walking through Soho at ten-thirty on a warm Friday night. There are literally hundreds of drunk people filling the streets outside pubs. An hour or two later, try waiting for a train or night bus home and you're sure to see people too drunk to walk straight. It seems so weird to me that alcohol doesn't count as a drug. People 'take alcohol' with the express desire of feeling its effects, plenty indulge to the point where they can't talk or walk or get home without help. I've never worked in a company that didn't have at least one functioning alcoholic in a senior position (oooh, apart from Snowbooks I mean). And most of us know someone or know of someone who drank themselves to death. I've never heard of anyone who smoked joints until they couldn't hold down a job, until you could see by looking at their face what they were addicted to, until they'd driven away friends and family and wrecked their health. To me at least, it seems surreal to be fussing over a couple of joints smoked in the Eighties, while ignoring millions dosing themselves with an addictive substance that kills thousands and accounts for half the work of hospital A&E departments.

I'm not saying ban them both or encourage them both, but I will say this: if I could magically swap the places of alcohol and marijuana I think I'd do it. I'd rather see pubs full of spaced-out (slightly paranoid) glaucoma-free stoners than bellowing and punchy boozers. And I've never heard of anyone smoking a joint too many and then smashing a glass in someone's face. If the government offer me the choice, I'd rather have hippies than hooligans I think.","","","","2007-07-26","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

In a shameless, direct steal from Scott at TFP, I've put together a lovely offer for any bookshop who wants to get all festive, Snowbooks-stylee. Go to a <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/christmas07.html"">Special Page</a> for details. In brief: long payment terms, massive discounts and - well, that's about it, really. Good, though. 

There's an offer for readers as well. Buy any three Snowbooks for &pound;16. That, scientifically speaking, is a Good Deal since our cheapest books are &pound;7.99.

What is going on here? The adult harry potter edition that was meant to arrive at our home address on Saturday arrived at work on Wednesday. I opened it today to get the returns note out, and glanced at the back cover. 

What?! Who is that horrifically ugly lady? Why, it's JK Rowling, who I've always thought looked quite good, especially after the money came in. What the bloody hell have they done to the poor woman in this photo? She looks like Victoria Wood's mother in Dinner Ladies.

Just to lay out my prognosticating credentials, if you've really been paying attention, you might remember me saying that after the middle of July, the rain was going to stop. Well, that's not what happened. Instead Britain has had the most rain ever. Ever. That's the approximate calibre of my predictive skills.","On the other hand, I've been boring people for a while on the subject of the U.S. economy. Just like the UK's, following a stock market shock at the beginning of the century, people seemed to want somewhere else to put their money. (Or in the case of the U.S. someone else's money. More on that in a minute.) On both sides of the Atlantic, real estate seemed like the answer. In the U.S. though, there was a good reason for the property market to take off. While vigorously waving the flag, U.S. industry has stealthily been transferring its manufacturing capacity overseas for some years now. A good proportion of Walmart's Made in America merchandise is made in China. A torrent of dollars flow into Chinese banks as massive convoys of container ships head in the opposite direction.

If the world worked the way the U.S. Treasury would like, one could keep printing dollars in order to pay for Chinese goods and everyone would be happy, but of course the world doesn't work that way. The dollar gets weaker against the renminbi (what a name!) and gradually Chinese goods aren't so cheap any more. But China is using its role as America's new industrial heartland to pay for its transition to affluent modern superpower and they don't want to jeopardise that - even if it means doing something apparently foolish. Instead of finding the best possible investment for all those incoming dollars, China puts them to a much less productive use: it invests them in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;China buys T-Bills - effectively giving the U.S. government gigantic low-interest loans - as well as investing on the U.S stock market, helping prop it up despite the loss of its manufacturing heart.

Dollars flow back into America and the result is that Chinese goods remain cheap and therefore desirable to Americans (which is what the Chinese want) and America is given truly vast amounts of credit at very low interest rates (which means it doesn't have to pay for anything). And what has America done with this credit? Well I'll steer clear of saying much about the government because this is not supposed to be a political post, but suffice to say it's been possible to start a war and cut taxes at the same time, by simply putting all military adventures on American's credit card. Private citizens, on the other hand, have borrowed money over the long term and spent it in the short term - or they've invested it in property. And it's not just cheap credit that has made property look good, it's also cheap fuel. 

Trying to do this sum in my head is making my eyes cross, but by my reckoning, U.S. petrol prices are about 33p per litre at the moment. It's considered a scandal. But compared to the U.K. price of 97p it's practically free. And fuel prices are important because of a third component of the US property boom: land. Unlike the UK, America actually has lots of places it could build new houses. Many of these green field sites include views over amber waves of grain and/or purple mountains' majesty*.  And if China will pay the mortgage and the petrol is cheap enough, building a house in some picturesque spot is a very attainable American dream for a lot of people - attainable, but not necessarily <em>sus</em>tainable.

As gas prices go up (and they do tend to if you start a war in the Middle East) out of town property gets less desirable. As US credit lines expand and expand, the dollar inevitably looks more precarious and that jeopardises future borrowing. One point in America's favour is that the dollar is <em>the</em> hard currency and a lot of the world's debt is denominated in dollars. That gives the U.S a special form of protection that other nations don't enjoy. The bills it has to pay abroad are often in dollar amounts, which means the dollar can weaken all it wants and the payments don't get any bigger. The flip side of that protection is that the pain is felt by the people on the opposite side of the deal: the investors. The weaker the dollar gets, the poorer an investment those old U.S. Treasury bills become. They cost strong dollars to buy, but they're paying out in weak dollars now. If the time ever comes when China and Saudi and the other big lenders decide to cut their losses and switch to Euro-denominated investments then America's protection becomes its downfall. In other words, the pre-eminence of the dollar staves off the collapse for longer, but when it happens it's that much deeper.

Throw in one more factor and I have to say the U.S. economy is not looking good in my opinion. America has been famous for a while for buying on credit (even worse than the U.K.), but it's gone further than before, with more credit than before, at a time when it has less chance of paying its bills then before. So there are plenty of people out there with mortgages they can't pay off on houses that won't be worth much if a) interest rates rise and b) gas prices rise. And let's face it, both of those things are likely to happen.

Let me remind you again that I have no track record at all in predictions. None. But I think massive investors like China and Saudi will move away from U.S. investments. Which means the U.S. won't have money available for loans so interest rates will rise. The property boom has already started to slump, but rising interest rates and high gas prices will cause a property crash. That will hit the middle class in America very hard, ruining small businesses and pushing middle managers into bankruptcy. The U.S. working class is already feeling the pinch: no healthcare, no manufacturing jobs, real wages down. Personally, I think the result will be a major crash and a depression. 

The only upside I can see is a political one, so look away now if you don't want my lefty political views rankling your ire. I think this crash will also mean the end of the Republican party in its current incarnation. It is, to use a phrase much beloved of political commentators, a perfect storm: a record-breakingly unpopular administration turns Clinton's economic golden era into a full-blown crash while destroying American goodwill right around the world. The endless dirty laundry of this administration will receive a proper airing just as the economy tanks and just as Americans go to the polls next year. I think the hard right in the U.S. have had it. Unfortunately it's everyone else who'll have to pay the price.

One final note for anyone who's read this far and is tempted to be depressed: I tried to teach myself economics a while back, having never studied it in a classroom. I then took an A-Level in it and got an 'Unclassified'. That's the lowest possible mark you can get. It is entirely possible that none of the foregoing is accurate. Let's hope, eh.

- 'a great search engine' (check, although not sure it counts because I only created it 45 seconds ago)
- 'intelligent recommendations' (er...)
- 'bang up-to-date catalogue information' (check, phew. Hooray for Anko's APM, ONIX and XSLT that makes this touch-of-a-buttony)
- 'News pages are great -- if they are kept updated' (the blog will have to do)
- 'Book detail pages should all have book cover graphics' (check)
- 'additional content (index, introductions, afterwords) should be online as a matter of course' (EEK! There's no excuse here, it's all part of the ONIX standard. I just need to amend the XSLT.)
- 'Detailed information about all authors and links to fan sites etc. should come next' (almost eek. We have some info but not much, really)
- 'An interesting blog would be nice' (check check check. Well, a blog. You'll have to judge whether it's interesting)
- 'forums are possible.' (nah, can't be arsed to maintain one)
- 'Social networking sites and Web 2.0 technologies offer still further chances to build a publisher's brand and their readership.' (watch this 'ere space).

It's finally happening! Andy and I are moving to the country. This is the view from our new house that we've decided to rent in the Cotswolds. 

Some people might think that I am a big copycat and just because Rob's got a new house I have decided to have one too. Well, that's... well that's right, actually. Too many manky things have happened to us in London of late for me to be willing to put up with it any more, and when we went to see Rob at the weekend and had such a lovely time we had one of those 'life's too short' epiphanies. Andy will bravely stay mainly in town in the week and then retire to the country at the weekend, and when he's not there there will be a steady stream of relatives and builders to look after the London place. The main thing is that the cats will move down to the country, which shows where our hearts are. 

So I'm going to be working from home for the first part of the week, and coming into the office Thursdays and Fridays. I am shattered at the moment from all the excitement but will no doubt talk about it at length over the next few weeks with all the details! We move at the end of the month.

I've taken a rather circuitous route into the office this morning. Bike to office, walk to Kings Cross, tube to White City, tube back from White City, bus back to office. See, I was going to be on the Today programme but there was a collapsing bridge in Minneapolis that needed to be talked about (Anna is fine, phew). 

I might be on it tomorrow, talking about cover design. I wasn't going to tell the internets because it made me a bit nervous thinking people might be listening, but heck. The real question now is what will I wear *tomorrow*? I've used up my allocation of just-bohemian-enough, just-smart-enough appearing-on-the-radio wear. Of course, it would be ridiculous for a person to have selected just the right pair of radio-going pants, so underwear selection won't be a problem...

I used to get up at 5.30 a lot when I had a proper job, but those days are long gone and my system is threatening to go on strike unless it gets artificial stimulants, stat. To the coffee machine!

Very exciting, this living in the country. All day long the house martins swoop about catching invisible things - or just playing - I can't tell which. And then at dusk there's a little pause before a bat takes over the bug patrol. It loops around and around the barn, so close to the windows it almost looks like it's inside instead of outside. Then of course last night it took me a moment to realise that it *was* actually inside, circling silently around my living room.","Even though I'm very fond of bats I can see why they make people nervous. In a confined space you think they must bang into you sooner or later. So I opened the tallett doors wide to let it out and then crouch-walked to get my camera. Sadly the one picture I took didn't contain a bat and seemed to scare it off (or maybe vapourise it - I didn't see it go). But next time I'll be braver; it flew thirty or forty times round the room and up and downstairs a couple of times and didn't bang into me once. And between them the bat and the martins are doing a terrific job. I have the doors and windows open whenever I can, and nothing has bitten me yet - and I'm someone who gets bitten by every passing wing&eacute;d bug-critter on the market. So, no pictures of bats or martins (next time perhaps); instead a picture of one of the many butterflies here. Click on the little picture to see it in all its saturated vibrancy.

Your choices are: the bat, shetland ponies, baby shetland ponies, a buzzard, martins and swifts and swallows, more butterflies, scads of rabbits, a very white cat called Pickle.","","","","2007-08-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

That was fun! You can hear me gently disagreeing with Fay Weldon on Radio 4's Today programme <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/listenagain/"">here. </a> Scroll down the page and click on 0800-0830, and fast forward to about 18.28 or download an MP3 file <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Mrs_Barnes_on_Radio4.mp3"">here</a> (it's about 4-5MB - or click the little arrow to 'stream' the file (whatever that means)). 

I think I'll tell you what it was like in detail because I found it fascinating.","I've done lots of interviews for magazines and papers but never for radio, so it was unchartered territory for me. I arrived very early, despite there being huge delays on the Central line which I was rather grateful for  - if the train hadn't gone at walking pace I would have arrived an hour early and that's just embarrassingly keen. 

So I got there at 7.45, and sat next to the Tardis in reception, and a lady came to get me at 8.10. She took me and another gentleman upstairs, and put us both in a waiting area. A moment later she came back and asked me to go with her, and showed me into a corner office. I sat, got my bearings, and realised it was the actual room, with the actual presenters, with actual microphones and a sign that said 'on'. For some reason I thought I'd be in one box and they would be in another box, like in the pictures of radio in the second world war (I am not very current). There was a tape of an interview playing, and the presenters were having conversations with the people outside the room over the intercom. It was all so laid back - they let the door bang (it was a quiet bang, but all the same), they type away and rustle papers and people like me just saunter in and have a sit down. 

I wasn't told to do anything, and didn't want to interrupt anyone so I sat quietly until Ed Stourton looked up and said 'Ah! You must be [refer to papers, rustle] Emma Barnes!' They have pages and pages of information about what's going on in front of them, so they quickly read the notes and were then ready to go. Pretty impressive. I found that as soon as the conversation turned to something I knew about, all my nerves disappeared and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it did make me think how clever the presenters are for being able to rapidly absorb all sorts of stories from someone else's notes and then to be able to ask sensible questions. I was told to put on the headphones in front of me as Fay Weldon was in the Salisbury office (not office - er, studio!). It was seamless - the presenters were talking to each other about something, then suddenly they were talking and the rest of the country was listening. 

It started; it was over. I wasn't sure what to do - whether I should leave the room or wait until the microphones were switched off - but James Naughtie beckoned to me to come to his side of the table. He showed me the cover design on his screen for his book that's coming out in October. I thought it was very good and nodded a lot, because the poor sports man was trying to talk about sports and I didn't want to be a distraction. And then I left the room. 

I know this reads a bit like a school trip report, but it was a super adventure and I wanted to write down exactly what happened so I remember. I think I'd like to be a radio star when I grow up.","","","","2007-08-03","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","11"

I'm still trying to work out how to get a picture of Mr Bat. Obviously I'll need to use a flash because he only comes out at night, but before the flash goes off, how will I tell if there's a bat in frame? And what if after the flash goes off the bat crashes its fuzzy little head into my barn? Problems.","Meanwhile Kris asked for pictures of baby ponies. And frankly, Kris deserves photos a lot more than you mooching vespertiliphiles. When have you ever picked me up from the airport or offered to make me a stack of pancakes? Exactly. So while I try to work out the logistics of bat snaps, here are baby mini-ponies. Click on the pictures to get a bigger version. The one below is of baby mini-ponies lining up to be patted by Em.

Re: David's question. Why should I worry about dazzling creatures who navigate by squeak. I had it in mind they still like to see. Here's what the Internet had to say: ""Insect-eating bats have small eyes, as they use the special sense of echolocation for finding their food. However, they still use their eyesight for avoiding large objects, gauging their height above the ground and finding their way across a landscape by navigating between prominent landmarks. Although not as well developed as a fruit bat's eyesight, their vision is particularly sensitive to low light conditions. 
Even on the darkest night there is some light around and all bats use this."" Better not fry its retinas then.","","","","2007-08-04","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"
"41062","","1","Capitalism versus democracy in the U.S.","Publish","true","<img src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/p.gif""/><p>Oh no, it's the dreaded green 'P' of politics again. If you're easily offended by wacko-lefty politics (or easily bored by them) then back away. Here instead is a link to <a href=""http://www.cuteoverload.com/"">Cute Overload</a>. </p>","<p>Something to&nbsp;think about if you have a spare moment: Should you be able to get a better seat at the theatre just because you've got the money to pay for it? Should you be able to have a nicer car just because you're well off? Should you be brought a glass of champagne before take-off just because you paid a lot more for your plane ticket?</p> <p>It seems safe to answer 'yes' to all of the above. After all, what is wealth if it isn't the ability to get nicer things. </p> <p>Now here are some more marginal scenarios to think about. Should the lawyer representing you in court be more capable because you have more money? Should your children get a better education, and thus have a better chance of getting a good job,&nbsp;than poorer people's? Should your medical care (and maybe your life expectancy) be superior to those with less cash? </p> <p>And how about this next batch of questions: If you've got more money should you have proportionally more say about what goes on in government? Should you be exempt from certain regulations? Should you ever have to queue or show up in person for anything? Should people have to call you sir? Should you be able to pass on your wealth so that your children don't have to work, potentially for many generations? Should your integrity be called into question less readily than those with smaller back accounts? And finally: should you be allowed to use your money to influence the way democracy works in favour of rich people like yourself?</p> <p>Capitalism is a collection of ideas, at the heart of which is the notion that if we each go after what we want then the web of deals and schemes we come up with will create an efficient economy. And it will work better than trying to design an economy. In principle, letting a few people get very rich is the same thing as rewarding merit. Those who put their money to the best use end up with more of it. And 'the best use' for them is also the best use for the economy because it's all about find the most productive use of capital, assets and labour. (Of course, equating wealth with ability only works if the system is fair - and if wealth, once amassed, doesn't just get inherited down an infinite number of generations like some sort of permanent aristocracy.)</p> <p>Many people have so much faith in the ingenuity of the free market that they expect it to solve all the big problems that face us including, say, the climate change problem. And they can point to times in the past when despite much hand-wringing about some upcoming limit to growth, the free-market economy found a way round it.</p> <p>And it's true;&nbsp;by itself that ingenuity knows no limits. And that's both a good and a bad thing. If free market self-interest can somehow get fresh food to the heart of a big city (a problem seen as a natural limit to urban growth in the past) why shouldn't it also find a way to turn democracy to the advantage of the economy's most capable investors? In other words, what's to stop good old free-market ingenuity subverting democracy?</p> <p>The genius of the American Dream, it's always seemed to me, is that it *is* a dream. For every self-made, rags-to-riches, local-boy-made-good story there are a thousand women and men who never make it. But they don't despair because the chance of success is all they ask, not the promise of it. And you have to wonder, would the feudal system have endured a lot longer if every year one or two serfs had been turned into lords, perhaps through some nationwide competition where brains, brawn, personality and skilll each boosted a candidate's chances. Could you really complain about being poor when power and wealth was on offer... to those who proved they deserved it?</p> <p>But look at someone like the current U.S. President. On academic merit alone it seems unlikely that Yale and Harvard would have been eager to see him. On business merit alone he would never have been a director of an oil company. And goodness knows, on talent alone, he should never have been elected to high public office. But it's extraordinary what the light-bending, reality-warping effects of money and influence can achieve.</p> <p>Is it possible that money is all that stood between George W. Bush and a life of modest failure and total obscurity? In other words is altering the outcome of presidential elections one of the things that being rich - sufficiently rich - can achieve? So add that to the list of questions at the top: should you be able to get someone elected president just because you have a lot of money?</p> <p>How would the irrepressible capitalist spirit even go about such a thing as warping the democratic process? Well, the trick, if you think about it, is to make everything expensive. It seems counter-intuitive that those with the most money might want prices to go up; that's not the way to hold onto your money. But it is the way to convert money into power. If you can put a price tag on something, and if that price tag is high enough, then the very rich become the only ones with access to it.</p> <p>And somewhere along the line it became very expensive to get elected. You might be a presidential candidate&nbsp;in favour of helping the poor, but unless you can come up with at least three hundred million dollars you'll never get elected. And who has that sort of money? Not poor people, that's for sure. It is, literally, impossible to get elected president these days without a lot of very rich friends (or a fewer number of astronomically rich ones). Just think about that statement. You can only be president if enough rich people like you. That's not quite the definition of democracy most of us would come up with.</p> <p>And from what I can gather, capitalism's&nbsp;secret weapon has been the thirty-second campaign commercial. TV is expensive so it's perfect as a forum for allowing election candidates to woo the citizenry - perfect if you're rich, I mean. An enormous part of any political campaign is conducted through ads, most of them on expensive TV.</p> <p>Of course the second problem for democracy fans of using television as the place you go to in order to get elected is that TV stations are owned by people. Specifically rich people. With the 'concentration' of U.S. media in recent years, pretty much every TV station is part of an absolutely gigantic media conglomerate. I've talked about this before. Pro-big-business politicians done deals with media companies along the lines of: we'll repeal certain laws so you can expand if you'll bear in mind we can put those laws back. But besides that, those media conglomerates *are* big businesses. That's two very good reasons why the editorial side of TV is heavily in favour of the pro-big-business political candidate. People may talk about the so-called liberal media, but there are no billion-dollar corporations with left-leaning agendas. And there are no significant media outlets that aren't part of billion-dollar corporations.</p> <p>So the entry fee to a presidential election is several hundred million dollars and the contest itself is fought largely on the airwaves of media mega-corporations with their own, pro-business axes to grind. And the same thing, to a lesser extent, happens with congressional, senatorial and gubernatorial races. </p> <p>The proof that all this has a huge effect is in the legislation and the loyalties of the Republican party. They will, on occasion, cross their rabid-Christian base. They will gleefully abandon their small-government, fiscally-responsible historic principles. But what they won't do is abandon big business or the super-rich. </p> <p>It not only explains why the Republicans push so hard in the directions they do, it also explain why the Democrats are afraid of their own shadows.&nbsp;Because not only do the Republicans have a Republican base, the Democrats have a Republican base too: the people who pay their bills. Any Democrat who actually tried to rein in big business, scale back military&nbsp;spending and tax the hyper-rich&nbsp;in proportion to their wealth would be reviled in mainstream (=corporate media) editorials, their every blunder mysteriously prime-time news, not to mention finding themselves short of the cash to rebut any of that negativity with a few much-needed prime-time commercials.</p> <p>It may not make sense at first glance, but the best way to make sure that money converts directly into power is to make sure that everything - even democracy - costs a lot.</p>","","","","2007-08-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

Yey, I've finished my bookkeeping for the week. I am a good person. In exchange I am going to treat myself to a frivolous blog post that has only the most tenuous links to publishing. It is Five Things I Like.","1) Cycling to and from work. 

I like to think of myself as special; don't we all? In my book, the best way to feel superior to one's fellow man is to cycle past a bus stuffed to the brim with them. Even in the rain I love it! It gives me the greatest sense of freedom and a feeling that I am able to do exactly what I like with London. London doesn't own me: I am not tied to its infrastructure, or stuck with its timetables. Plus it wakes me up. Plus it's quicker than the bus. Plus there's a really good hill that I can go 'wheee' down - but only under my breath - I am a professional, after all. 

2) Other people doing their job.

The corollary of this one, of course, is other people not doing their job, which happens so often that I am nowadays really grateful when people just do the basics. For instance, I have emailed a certain person today, asking them a very urgent question. They have not replied. If they had replied, I would be very grateful. It's not too much to ask (well, obviously, it is.) On a positive note, I can email my lovely new bank (Coutts) and they reply smartly - even when they're on holiday - with a lovely, clear note that answers my question. Yes, you read that correctly. I can *email* my bank and they *email* me back. It's like the future! Go on, try it now. Email your bank and see what happens. I'll wait here. 

3) Rain. 

Big fan of rain. It keeps people inside so I get to have London to myself. And I like getting wet and then having a hot bath. 

4) Getting things done. 

Like my bookkeeping - I really, really loathe doing it, but hey! It's done! Huge cause for celebration. And like going on the radio - I felt sick for two days prior to it but yey! I did it! And now I'm all proud of myself and haven't stopped going on about it. 

5) My friends. 

An obvious one, I know, but I have smashing friends. One is my wonderful husband, Andy, who is just about the best husband a girl could possibly hope to have. My other main friend is Rob, who is just about the best business partner a girl could possibly hope to have. How lucky am I? And there is a whole set of similarly wonderful people who are smashing too (you know who you are). There's a longer post to go here about the importance of a balanced management team, and how complementary Rob and I am (cue all sorts of nonsense about how I like his tie, by way of getting the two sorts of complimentary / complementary confused - an old joke which we've had going for about 8 years) but for the moment suffice to say that my select group of excellent friends make life an utter joy. 

So that's five things I like. Back to work now.","","","","2007-08-07","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

So do you want to have your covers designed by Snowbooks?

Bet you do. I would. Not only are they nice to look at, they sell books. But did you know that they are also about as cheap as you can get? You can download our new <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/ratecard.pdf"">ratecard here</a>. It shows you that cover design is only &pound;550 - and that includes all original and stock artwork. 

Seriously, it's a bargain. *And* we are quick and nice to deal with. Ask anyone. I'm sure Scott Pack would give us a reference, wouldn't you, Scott? We can turn a brief around in a couple of days, if pushed.

In a mashup of Vintage's Twins initiative, the concept of 'if you liked this you'll love that', and my inevitable clamour for attention when it's not directed at Snowbooks, here is an Alternative Booker Longlist drawn exclusively from Snowbooks titles.","<strong>Darkmans by Nicola Barker</strong>. Matt Thorne says its themes are ""the impact of the past on the present, and how the modern novel or town cannot afford to ignore history."" Well, since the self-same Matt Thorne so kindly reviewed our forthcoming <strong>The Red Men</strong>, saying ""This vision of the near-future would be terrifying if it weren't so hilarious. Matthew De Abaitua makes Michel Houellebecq seem like Enid Blyton"", I reckon we can pair those two. 

<strong>Self Help by Edward Docx</strong> is ""an ambitious, careering novel peopled by damaged characters"" <a href=""http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/generalfiction/0,,2131271,00.html"">(Guardian).</a> <strong>Memphis Underground</strong> for you, then. 

<strong>The Gift Of Rain by Tan Twan Eng.</strong> First time novelist; a book ""set in Penang in 1939 it recounts life in Malaya during the war but from the Malaysian point of view."" <a href=""http://dovegreyreader.typepad.com/dovegreyreader_scribbles/2007/03/the_gift_of_rai.html"">(dgr)</a>. Hmm. Ah, but what's this? ""half Chinese-half English main protagonist who is devoted to Endo-san his Japanese Sensei who trains him in the art of aikido."" Excellent - paired with Bob Breen's <strong>Fighting.</strong> Forget the fiction - learn to fight properly! 

<strong>The Gathering </strong>- by Anne Enright ""brilliantly delineates the wonder and horror of love,"" says AL Kennedy in the <a href=""http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2066916,00.html"">Guardian.</a> Does it now. Well <strong>JD Landis' Longing</strong>-  does the best, most intricate job I've ever read of telling of an all-consuming love between two people. Plus it has music. 

<strong>The Reluctant Fundamentalist </strong>- by Mohsin Hamid is ""a quietly told, cleverly constructed fable of infatuation and disenchantment with America,"" says James Lasdun in the <a href=""http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2025106,00.html"">Guardian.</a> Bet it's not a patch on Noah Cicero's <strong>The Human War. </strong>

<strong>The Welsh Girl </strong> by Peter Ho Davies. Another debut novelist. Its perfect partner is <strong>Deep Hanging Out </strong>- by Richard Gwyn - a fellow Welshman. 

<strong>Mister Pip</strong>  by Lloyd Jones. Set on a South Pacific island, DJ Taylor in the <a href=""http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/reviews/article2737899.ece"">Independent</a> says that ""rarely... can any novel have combined charm, horror and uplift in quite such superabundance."" Hee! Paired with <strong>Monster Island! </strong>

<strong>Gifted </strong> by Nikita Lalwani. Debut author. Coming of age across two different cultures: <strong>Paradise Jazz</strong> by Kat Pomfret. 

<strong>On Chesil Beach </strong> by Ian McEwan. A relationship story. Hell, let's pair it with Lisa Crystal Carver's <strong>Drugs Are Nice</strong>, simply for the shocking juxtaposition. 

<strong>What Was Lost </strong> by Catherine O'Flynn. First timer, and published by the lovely Tindal Street. I loved this book for its simplicity and heartbreaking sense of a lost life. We don't have anything like it so let's go with zombies again - <strong>Monster Nation,</strong> when the human race ate itself. Big sense of loss there. 

<strong>Consolation</strong> by Michael Redhill. Something about lost photos. I don't know; sounds dull. Pass. 

<strong>Animal's People </strong> by Indra Sinha. From the agent's blurb: ""Bawdy, irreverent and smart, Animal's compelling vernacular, with its mangled, Yoda-like syntax, conjures up the colour, cruelty and camaraderie of life in the Indian city of Khaufpur."" Sheesh. Let's pair it with <strong>Lint,</strong>-  which uses language in places that messes with your mind. 

And finally, <strong>Winnie & Wolf</strong>  by A.N.Wilson ""presents the story of the extraordinary relationship between Winifred Wagner and Adolf Hitler that took place during the years 1925-40, as seen through the eyes of the secretary at the Wagner house in Bayreuth. It reveals the remarkable capacity of human beings to deceive themselves."" Okay, let's go with <strong>Going Postal </strong>- a look at workplace and high school massacres in the US, where parents deceive themselves into thinking it's all because of Marilyn Manson. 

There you have it. A not at all tortured list of perfectly excellent alternatives to the boring old Booker.","","","","2007-08-08","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

First, a complaint. I upgraded to Adobe CS3 software in May 2007. Well, I say upgraded - I was recommended by the supplier to buy CS2 and use adobe's free upgrade to CS3. ""It'll be cheaper and simple,"" they said.","So, here we are in August. I'm still waiting. I've downloaded the trial versions but it's now been so long, they've expired. All I need is a serial number, as I've got the software from their trial download. I just need the serial number. I JUST NEED THE SERIAL NUMBER. I shouted this a number of times at them over email and down the phone to Belgium, or wherever their customer services is - it appears they can't hear me. 

Don't make me pirate software, Adobe. Don't make me...

I've had a mini-idea. I'd like to invite any writers who may be reading to submit some of their work for the express purpose of showcasing - ahem, *snow*casing - it on this blog. 

Lots of people read this blog, as I discover when I go to events and people who I didn't know read it say 'Hi Emma! Love the blog!"" (=unnerving but nice) and most of them work in publishing. If you'd like to have some of your writing showcased here, you have to be happy to post your email address, too (we can do the clever [at] thing to avoid spam). Who knows: if a publisher or agent is reading and likes your work, they might email you. Can't hurt, can it?

That was quick! Hot off the mark, Richard Wright has sent in an excerpt from his horror novel THY FEARFUL SYMMETRY. Richard is a horror author and occasional playwright living in Glasgow, whose work has appeared in America and the UK. 

In Glasgow's west end, an angel and demon fall in love, bringing the apocalyptic wrath of their masters down on the city and the world.","<strong>Thy Fearful Symmetry - Chapter One</strong>

Heaven pulsed around him like a vast, beating heart.  

At the very centre of the pulse, he floated in a void of scarlet light.  Each silent thump sent ripples of deeper crimson sluicing from him in all directions, man-shaped disturbances in a cosmic pool that had been still before he arrived.  There was no question that he was an intruder here.  His presence was like grit in a delicate machine.  He wondered what had brought him to this place.  If he was not welcome, why had he been yanked here?

Though he was aware of the question, it barely floated above his subconscious.  Most of his mind was devoted to not shutting down in shock and awe.  Eyes bulging, his chest quaking with the exertions of his exhausted heart, he waited and watched as the redness shimmered around him.  There was peace here, he knew it immediately, but this was not his time to sink into the blood colours and become part of the whole. 

A manic snigger escaped his lips, though no sound reached his ears.  Heaven was supposed to be lush fields of flowers and newly cut grass, with choirs of angels singing and every sinless delight on offer.  Perhaps this was the other place then, but that made no more sense to him.  Hell was fire, branding, and torture, surely?  No, even though he could not remember how he had come here, or what he was doing before he arrived, or even what his name had been before this immense vacuum claimed him, his body and soul knew this was Heaven.  His cells responded to it, and embraced it.  His mind could not.  Not my time, he thought.  Not my place.

When the voice came, it was directionless, emerging from the surrounding colour, from the fibres of his clothes, from his own flesh and hair.  The tone was rich and soft, but powerful, like a giant's caress.  He was certain that the voice could sharpen in an instant and tear him apart, though he felt love there too.  The name of his Lord refused to appear in his mind, and he was glad.  Naming the being who wrapped him up was too close to owning Him, and that would be sacrilege.  I am your thing, he thought, knowing that he was heard and understood.  I am your servant and tool.  For the first time in his life, bathed in the red light of his Lord, he understood exactly what that meant.  

Something nagged at his soul, a contradiction that had recently puzzled him, but he could not bring it to the fore.  He could do nothing at all but bathe in the voice that came from everywhere, and the light.

At first the words were incomprehensible, just vibration and tone on an immense scale.  There was meaning there, but he was too small, too limited, to understand what it was.  It was like sitting in a tree and trying to see the forest.  Slowly though, as he drifted, the words narrowed, the frequency shaping into something he could comprehend.

A word about smell and then linguistics.

Anna mentioned this to me recently: you buy something, say deodorant, and it has a distinctive smell that you don't think of as <em>your</em> smell - in other words, you now smell like someone else. I'm experiencing this today in a particularly weird way. My new deodorant is obviously made by a company who believe that the nose is gender-blind, because I now smell like my girlfriend from my early twenties. Alternatively it might just be that she's recently started stalking me. Tamsin? I don't owe you money or something, do I?","And that leads me on to a discussion about superpowers. Naturally. I can't remember where this originated - online somewhere maybe, or in an article - anyway, I read a thing where you have to choose between the superpowers of flying and invisibility. I remember the conclusion at the end of the piece that you feel you <em>should</em> choose flying but really you want invisibility - the idea being that flight is more mentally healthy but less actually tempting than sneaking around spying on people. But personally I'd prefer flying. I'm not convinced that makes me a more wholesome person, though, than the fans of invisibility. You could easily make a case for flying being anti-social or pathological non-confrontational or some such. The point is, I wouldn't choose invisibility, except maybe in the olfactory realm. 

I look for non-scented products whenever I can, but my shampoo, hand-soap, deodorant and laundry soap all smell strongly. The smell of laundry soap is particularly interesting/annoying to me. It reminds me of the evolution of the word 'silly', which I was reading about the other day. You'll see why in a moment, if you don't already. Someone at the soap company must have asked themselves what people want from a laundry detergent. 'Clean clothes' they would have answered themselves confidently. Then a doubt crept in: 'But how will people know that their clothes are clean?'. Again the confident response: 'Because they'll smell clean'. And once more the voice of doubt: ""But clean doesn't smell of anything. Clean is all about removing the things that smell.' One final idea settled the matter, 'Well then we'll make their clothes positively reek of things that people <em>associate</em> with the idea of cleanness. Flowers, pine and vanilla - all mixed together'. And the makers of hand soap, deodorant and shampoo thought the same thing. Which is why, in olfactory terms, I'm like a flashing neon beacon of clean. As are most of us. (Apart from people who ride on public transport. They don't smell of clean.)

And why is that like the evolution of the word 'silly'? Anyone? Bueller? Anyone? Because in Old English 'silly' originally meant 'blessed'. And then, because you couldn't really be favoured by god unless you were an innocent, by 1400 it came to mean 'innocent' instead. An innocent is deserving of compassion and that meaning took over a century later. But those most deserving of compassion are the weak, and by the mid seventeenth century 'silly' meant 'weak'. 'weak' being a term of contempt, 'silly' expanded in modern times to mean 'foolish'. I wonder if it's that sort of process - though greatly speeded up - that can lead a word like 'clean' to go from meaning 'purged of anything extraneous' to 'smells strongly of vanilla'.

Incidentally - or perhaps not so incidentally since this is supposed to be a publishers' blog - I got the story of the evolution of the word 'silly' from a popular linguistics book called The Power of Babel. I can heartily recommend it, though not perhaps to members of the Grammar Police. It's full of stories about how one particular dialect happened, accidentally, to be elevated above others and from that point onwards talking any other way was deemed slovenly. Aquitaine, for instance, used to be the language of nobility, until the French capital moved to the North, and then that self-same language was derided as the tongue of peasants.

Or another example: 'bad' grammar is often held to imply woolly thinking, low intelligence or a bad education. But most linguists will tell you that everyone talks grammatically... according to their own dialect, though not necessarily yours. Yet Standard English grammar is held up as the dialect of rationality and logic compared to the corrupt slang scruffy or Northern people speak. But then look at the following: I was, you was, he/she was, we were, you were, they were. It's 'wrong', but it's logical. 'was' is singular, 'were' is plural. The reason posh folk don't talk that way is that their dialect solidified just as 'thou' was going out of fashion. They started using 'you' - which had been a plural - to replace the singular 'thou'. And so they dragged along the plural form 'were' to go with it. If it wasn't for the fact posh people and books both say 'you (singular) were', you could make a pretty good case for 'you (singular) was'.

So if you have nothing better to do, read <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-Babel-Natural-History-Language/dp/006052085X/ref=sr_1_1/026-4755288-6551642?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186908042&sr=8-1"">The Power of Babel</a> by John McWhorter. I'm learning lots of brand new interesting things from reading it. (The only depressing thing about that is that I've actually read the book before.)

And finally, you might like to know that the picture above is not a symbol of clean; it's a very subtly out-of-focus flower from my garden. Click on it if you like your flowers to be in hi-res, close-up detail. And rather fittingly given where we started, because it's a picture it's completely odourless.","","","","2007-08-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Rachel Green has sent in ""Dead Line"", an urban fantasy novel. Rachel writes in the hills of Derbyshire with her two wyves, two children and two dogs. Her first book, ""An Ungodly Child"" won the regional prize in the ""Undiscovered Authors"" contest 2007 and will be published next year.

When the fate of the world rests on one mostly-innocent man and the elves are out to kill him, sometimes you wish you could kill him first. Then you're working to a Dead Line.","On an autumn day more glorious than the inside of a cathedral, Harold Waterman wandered through Laverstone woods. His fingers, trailing across the rough bark of beeches, told of the easy summer that had tailed off with the arrival of the equinox. He breathed in the heady scent of ripened crab apples and rowan berries on the rim of the forest as the squabbles of hungry starlings echoed through the trees.

He reached the edge, the gloom fading as the trees thinned. The path that separated the forest from the rough brush and stone bluffs of the Cheviots ran south to the Royal Park and north into the hills, where it petered out into little more than a rabbit trail. His whistle brought a wolf pushing past his legs, its weight threatening to topple him into a copse of sloes. Thorns plucked at his jacket.

Felicia growled, her hackles rising as her body stiffened. Harold followed her gaze. 'What is it, Fliss?' he asked. 'What can you smell?' He couldn't see anything that would threaten them but raised his cane just in case.

The wolf took a step forward, the low growl in her throat making Harold's hair rise in sympathy. Her nose dipped to the ground and she whined, prompting him to examine her find. He took off his gloves and dipped the end of a finger into the drips that lay among leaves of sycamore and birch. Rubbing it against his thumb, he took a cautionary sniff. 'Blood,' he said aloud.

The wolf stretched, her bones popping and cracking as they dislocated and reformed. 'Of course it's blood,' she said, rising to two feet. 'Do you think I'd be so spooked if it was someone's leftover watercolour?'

Harold took a step back, trying not to stare at the bare breasts of his partner's girlfriend. 'Sorry,' he said. 'It seemed the dramatic thing to say.'

'Dramatic?' Felicia snorted and stared up the path. 'We're not being filmed for television.' She shivered and allowed fur to grow over her naked flesh. 'Where there's blood there's mess.'

Harold moved his gaze up to her face. 'Not necessarily,' he said. 'We're at the edge of a forest. It could be anything. A rabbit caught by a fox or one of Mr. Morris' chickens.'

Felicia looked at him sideways. 'Do you think I can't tell the difference?' she said. 'I know the smell of rabbit. This is human. Male, early sixties, long white hair.'

'I'm impressed.' Harold looked back at the blood, already seeping into the loam. 'You can tell all that from just smelling this one patch of blood?'

'No.'  Felicia looked the other way down the path and, confident that they were alone, stepped out of the shadow of the trees onto the path. She turned to her left and pointed. 'The rest of him is over there.'

Derek Haycock has emailed the start of his novel, Franklin's Orb. Derek lives in Suffolk and writes full-time, mainly novels in the mystery genre.

A unique work of art, in the unlikeliest of settings, acts as a beacon for a journey of self-realisation and salvation.","Chapter 1: The End of the Beginning

Franklin stopped talking. He stopped for the best of reasons. He liked to talk because he always had so much to say. But then he stopped. I only turned my head for a moment to look at the small alarm clock on his bedside table. Barely a twist of my neck. In that moment, he stopped talking.
 
I haven't taken a drink since. Not that my body doesn't crave alcohol. It reminds me all the time. I can smell whisky through glass, sense it through brick, and caress it from twenty feet away. But now, when my skin shrinks around me as though it might split, I turn away and think about my last day with Franklin.

Have you ever wanted to run from yourself? Have you ever woken in the night and wondered why you're not dead yet? If you can look in the mirror and say no to both of these, and that you have no fears for the future, then I want to hear your story. I'll rest here, nestled quietly, and listen and marvel. Because I had to learn the hard way. 

You might think a near-photographic memory is a faculty to be envied; a key to success in any number of pursuits from science to gambling. But what if much you remember is beyond your comprehension? And what if that you can make sense of batters you mercilessly like an infinitely ringing, discordant echo? You would want release from that. Franklin coaxed me into letting my memories flow again. But more than that, he has enabled me to survive them.

My name is Archie Watts, although Franklin persisted in calling me by the unabbreviated Archibald. Coming from anyone else, that would have been unacceptable, but from Franklin, it was almost musical. He said, 'Your mother named you Archibald, not Archie. She wouldn't like it to be shortened.' I never really knew my mother, so somehow his insight, whether spurious or factual, was precious to me. As she died shortly after I was three, and as Franklin was about my age, or a little younger, he couldn't have known her either. But when he spoke about her to me, it was as if he did know her, and he always spoke in a kind of whimsical present tense as if it was possible my mom could return.

I was working as a building maintenance man in the depressingly appropriately named borough of Hardich, south London; a job for which I was ill-prepared by background, aptitude or training. But I was prepared to work for minimum wage rates, and was as conscientious as my addiction spared me to be. The landlord, John Earl, owned two residential buildings, and I had to service both of them; a total of one hundred and sixty-four apartments. The tenants were charged exploitative rents for damp, draughty rooms, separated by partition walls with the sound-proofness of cardboard.

The first email of the week - the *very first email* - is a request from a customer to authorise returns of more than 3000 units across four titles. 

There is a shop two doors along from the office called Pentonville Rubber. They sell foam, rubber mats and bean bags in horrible colours. There is no parking. Their window is broken. The foam is all discoloured round the edges. And how much demand for rubber mats can there possibly be? Sometimes I wonder how they stay in business. 

Today, I'm thinking that their industry looks a damn sight easier than mine.","","","","","2007-08-13","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","8"

Here's a snowcase submission from Caroline called Kill-Grief, in which an 18th-century nurse finds that no amount of rotgut gin can help her escape her crime-filled past. 

Caroline says: ""I live in Buckinghamshire and I'm currently getting away without having a day job, instead dossing about at home looking after my baby son."" 

(I can't wait to read all of this one - sounds great!)","Chapter 1

<i>Chester, 3rd January 1756</i>

Narrowed eyes watched her from across the street. High up in the confines of Cornmarket Row, she gripped the oak railing and returned the stare.

Rain gusted into the walkway and numbed her lips. The eyes narrowed further, as if she were the first darkenings of a horizon, and her knuckles whitened on the rail.

Mary feigned distraction at the drunkards who laughed and skittered on the mud below. Squawks of geese grated in her ears and the sulphurous stench of the gutters surged and ebbed with the wind. 

Tightness gathered in her stomach. The man did not move. Slumped against a shop wall, he rested his stubbly head on the bricks, heedless of the people who skirted round his legs.

<i>Hark at you - gawping at a scabby beggar!</i> Mary took up her bag. A few more days in the city and she would ignore him like the rest of them. She hurried on. 

Cursing drivers, bellowing poultry hawkers, beer-fuelled brawlers - the city seemed made of gaping mouths. Stumps of teeth as rotten as taters, gums mashed by scurvy, noses crumpled by the pox.  Mary squeezed round a horde of men outside a tavern, their armpits level with her nostrils. Beyond their oniony heat and the blast of ale fumes, the air chilled her face. 

Then she stopped and looked back. The beggar's gaze had followed her, as folk always said of portraits. She blew out a long sigh. Sometimes the tangle under her ribs writhed so hard she thought of cutting it out with a knife.

A church clock tolled close by. Eleven. <i>Damn.</i> She had promised she would be there by then. Down on the street, away from the shelter of the Row, muck splashed her stockings and seeped through to her legs. The beggar shoved back his sleeves and thrust his arms into the rain, wringing his face into a grimace. Scabs and weeping blisters pitted his skin.

<i>You'll have to deal with worse than him.</i> His stare made Mary's neck itch. A rut, frozen beneath the dirt, made her stumble and swear. The man showed his teeth in a yellow grin, dragged himself up and strolled towards her.

Mary clattered up the steps of the Northgate Street Row, her breath quickening. She had nothing to give him - he must be able to see that. Why did he not follow the gentleman with the gold-threaded hat, or grab watches from the waists of the vast hooped petticoats that blocked the walkways? But then she felt for her pocket. The lump of coins was still there, from the pound <i>he</i> had given her.

This second storey of shops looked smarter. Too smart for her. She hesitated. 

<i>Do you think yourself better, Mary? </i>

But she slipped into the nearest doorway and waited for the beggar to pass. He scratched his hands as he walked, his nails dislodging clusters of scabs.

OK, a good chat to Rob, a deep breath and a good morning's worth of heads-down work, and things are looking up. The Bookseller (hello Tom!) are interested in running a story on the Snowcase, which is very friendly of them. I have learned a new thing in Photoshop (always a pleasure) about duotones.  I have done one of my bank recs. I have fixed my computer's USB ports. I have sent out a few invoices. All is well with the world. 

I might have said it here before: the most important attribute to crack when running your own business is to manage your own temperament.","What does that mean? It means that when things aren't perfect, to not panic. It means that when you've got more tasks that you can possibly manage, to calmly work through them one by one. It means that if you're getting bogged down by detail and overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the impossibility of growing a business organically whilst not selling out your principles, to have a nice cup of tea, take a deep breath and just start chipping away. 

Sometimes - and I know I'm doing it and instantly regret it - especially if I'm tired, things start to overtake me and the sheer difficulty of it all starts to get to me - like this morning. As soon as I realise it's happening, I launch into my three-prong plan of action. First, call Rob. He is so brilliant at rationally explaining to me, with examples and diagrams, why everything is going to be fine. Secondly, doctor the to-do list. It's so lame that I can trick my brain so easily, but by simply shifting 80% of today's tasks into tomorrow and the rest of the week, my head clears, I can think logically again and I have the breathing space I need to take stock. Thirdly, I get a whomping big americano and start to chip away at the tasks and action plan, one by one, bit by bit. 

Works every time. Worked this morning. I should patent this as a foolproof methodology for business success. You'll have to get your own Rob, though.","","","","2007-08-13","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

<i>Be Careful What You Wish For</i>

'I'd rather run off and join the circus than take a cheap handout of money from you!' These were the last words I'd screamed at Finlay as he left me completely broke, financially and in every other way.
            In hindsight, fate proved to have a sense of humour, because there I was, standing in the centre of bedlam, in the heart of a media circus, otherwise known as a New York newspaper office. One year on, I'd left Dublin city behind and was working in Manhattan in the depths of winter. Though for how much longer I'd actually be employed as a journalist was open to debate. 
            'Malory! Where the hell's that editorial?'
            Ah, the call of the ringmaster. Royce was the editor who cracked the whip in this particular circus. Then there was the high-wire acts performed by the wannabe celebrity hacks precariously clinging on to their careers by their fingernails. No safety nets in this job.
            Over near the window where some real daylight shone in mid-morning were the tenacious tabloid sub-editors whose cages you rattled at your peril. 
            Royce rushed out of his office, grabbed my editorial and charged off again. 
            All was fine for twenty minutes - a record in that office. Then Royce emerged and took another run at me.
            'Malory, I need you to do a job for me. All my paps are down with the lurgy'. He paused, suddenly focussing on me. 'Is that your hat?'
            I was jolted into replying, 'Yes'.
            'Hmm,' he said, thrusting an assignment into my hand.
            I read the jist of it. Movie premiere, mega celebrities, get exclusive pics of the lead stars.
            'A paparazzi job? I can't do this. And what's wrong with my hat? It's Baltic out there.' Okay, so my colourful, fuzzy wool monstrosity was fashionably challenged, but it was cosy.
            'It's just so not Manhattan,' he said as he stomped off.
            I wished they wouldn't keep talking backwards. So not Manhattan. Grrrr!
            'I'm soooo not bloody doing this job,' I shouted after him.
            Everyone stopped and stared at me.
            Royce turned and snarled. 'Give me three valid reasons why.'
            'Well, I haven't had my conscience removed. I'm a journalist not a photographer, and you've given me a complex about my hat.'
            A camera was sitting amid a pile of several others on a desk beside the coffee machine. Royce snatched one, pressed a few buttons and checked the flash.
            He thrust the camera into my paws. 'There's the camera, there's the assignment, and there's the door.'
 
It was snowing at the movie premiere. I was glad I'm worn my woolly hat.
            Crowds were gathered and hoards of big, burly paparazzi were prowling the red carpet area.
            I tightened the loops on my hat, and then did something outrageously out of character. Anyone who says a leopard never changes its spots has never worked in the media. As I got ready to run, I swear my hat grew devilish little horns. 
            That photograph was mine...

From Rob: I'm surprised there are no comments yet from John and Judith A-W here. When I was in my mid-twenties, I would go round to John A-W's bachelor flat to drink his booze and he'd sometimes suggest watching a video. 'A video' being the operative phrase because he only owned one. Top Gun. Of course there was always Judith's one video - Dirty Dancing - if we got tired of making fun of Maverick. But that didn't happen very often. Somewhat against my will, I've seen that movie dozens of times. Thank goodness I drank in those days.","","","","2007-08-14","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","5"

This is the start of The Voices of Angels - the story of a twelve year old boy who believes he's a guardian angel sent to earth to save his father's life.","The journey has begun.  I am standing on deck staring into the sea and wondering where my parents are taking me.  On a ship, in a sea, running away.  We left in the middle of the night and drove onboard at dawn.  I was asleep.  And when I woke I could no longer see land.  
I have never seen the sea before so the first thing it reminds me of is the colour of my eyes.  It makes me think if everyone's eyes are borrowed from the sea, or the land or the sky.  Probably.  It's like the time Mum wanted to paint her bedroom, and she couldn't decide between rose petal pink and lavender.  If paint colours are stolen from nature, why not eyes?  I start to daydream.  I imagine Mum coming down here one night when she was pregnant with me.  She wears a long white dress and the weather is frosty.  She kneels down on the edge of the shore and scoops some sea-water into a jam jar.  In the light of a full moon she takes note of the blue/green water.  I like this thought of Mum being on the beach at night, collecting the colour of her son's eyes.  I also know it is quite far-fetched.  I can't remember the last time Mum left our street which makes this trip even stranger.
The ship bobs and I search the sea for dolphins.  And after a while I feel someone at my side.  Over the salt of the sea and the oil of the ship's engine I can still smell him.  He smells like old people do.  I look at his hands and they are full of veins.  I peek up at him. His eyes are the colour of a pale blue sky with clouds in it.  And his face has as many wrinkles as there are waves which batter the hull.   Maybe he is searching for dolphins too.  And over the crashing of the waves and the throb of the engine I hear a sigh that even the plankton at the bottom of the sea must hear too.  He turns to me and ruffles my hair.
'Hello young man.'  
'Hi,' I answer shyly. 
I smile and there's something about the way we look at each other that makes me think we are friends.  I have never met my Granddad because he is dead.  This old man smiles back and seems pleased to see me.  As his smile widens it's then I spot it. 
I almost wish I hadn't.  
He must have come out on deck for a reason. Perhaps he has been called out. I sweep my gaze out to sea, the grey clouds, the damp sea salt air, and I bite my lip and wonder if I should I say something.

Snowcase #7 is from David Stockley, and is called The Re-Birth. It is the first historical novel to have been written using Graham Hancock's extraordinary 'alternative history' as its main source and inspiration. 

A lifelong student of ancient history, David has long been fascinated by the research of Hancock, Bauval and others. The Re-Birth is his second novel.","The crowd had been gathering at the field of the gods throughout the morning, as all sought to gain a prime position ahead of the ceremony. Kathan sighed as the deep, eerie sound of the priests' trumpets cut across the silence, their droning noise filling the air with a strange vibration that seemed to relax and please the crowd in equal measure. As the hypnotic tones grew louder, they began to sway, while the priests took up their places around the base of the pyramid which dominated this highest point of the city. The trumpets were soon joined by the deep base voices of the senior priests, as they chanted their prayers on arrival, swaying gently back and forth, as they moved to take up their positions. 
As the herald blew his horn, the crowd joined in the chants, and as if by some strange force the people in front of him parted. A grim looking Kathan walked from the north corner of the field, together with the rest of the city's dignitaries and their families, to take up their places on the large flat stone, raised above the crowd, from which they, and they alone, could watch the ceremony. In front of him stood the great pyramid; situated at highest point of the city, it towered over all other buildings in Sippar. Made of stone and painted white, the top twenty blocks at it apex were covered in gold, which gave it a shimmering, celestial appearance, as it reflected the midday sun. Kathan, not for the first time, gazed up in awe at this man made splendour. It had been built many years ago by Adapa, the first of the great priest-kings, to honour the old gods of the city, who it was said had given the people the land they lived on, when life had first began. How times had changed, thought Kathan sourly, and the old ways had gone, ever since Toran had taken control of the city. Sippar had grown old and tired, and Toran's promise that it would once again be great and prosperous had been good enough for most.
Anticipation mounted within the crowd as they gazed up at the gleaming monument, many shielding their eyes from its glare. This was not just the centre of their city, but of their entire world, from which all the power of the gods emanated, where all came to pray; the place where all things mystical and mysterious happened, and where the ritual of human sacrifice was about to take place.
At a second blast from the herald's horn, the entire crowd fall silent, for now the high priests entered the field, dressed in pure white robes. All looked on quietly as these strange, bald men moved to take up their positions, in front of the city dignitaries. A third blast and they began to bow, as from the same corner of the field came Toran, high priest and king of Sippar, and the man who would perform today's ritual.

This next author is a psychologist and writer. This extract, from the first chapter of his second novel, was inspired by his work with asylum seekers. The novel is called All Our Yesterdays. 

Joseph, an ex boy soldier and 'A' level student hopes for refugee status in the UK. Natalie, a fellow student, inadvertently sabotages his plans.","All Our Yesterdays 

Joseph

    I have many ways of keeping The Stolen Years at bay - during the hours of daylight that is.
   Pacing around the bright corridors, like this, at lunchtimes, towering over most of the other students, keeping faces, with their curious eyes, a blur is one I have come to rely on: for driving The Stolen Years from my thoughts. Always aware they're lurking, just out of sight, in the gloomy, convoluted passages of my brain, ready to spring out at any moment; like in some violent computer role play game that wouldn't even qualify for an 18 rating.
     Lately I've taken to calling them SY, sometimes Sci - as in Sci-fi - or even sigh, depending how I feel.  
    I quite often talk to myself like this: as if I am giving a running commentary on my life. It's is a sort of letter I'm dictating to someone like Brother Francis - a letter I haven't written and never will.
   On the whole, it seems to be a good 'coping strategy' (as one of the shrinks I have had to see puts it), unlike drinking forty cups of coffee a day to keep myself awake at night and cat napping, when I dare, during the day. The shrink? You didn't tell me about that one did you Brother Francis? That, to stand any chance of being allowed to stay in this colourless country, you're expected to dredge it all up with a virtual stranger. 
     But I couldn't possibly pass the horrors I have been part of onto another human being. See the lights go out in another pair of eyes soft with compassion before they sweep from me only to come back like searchlights glinting with fear and suspicion. No, they can't all be full of Christ-like mercy, like you Brother Francis. Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, Kyrie eleison. It does still help.
Coming in my direction, now, jostling and vying like puppies, a group of white boys is taking up most of the width of the corridor. New - probably NVQ - students, I think, and alter my course to avoid them. The double doors to Beauty Therapy swing open and two mixed-race girls step out, chatting. The boys slow down, starting to crane their necks, their eyes practically out on stalks now and the girls, who have stopped in the entrance, are staring back, blanking them. 
Same game the world over. Miremba appears in my mind, like a piece of old film footage, her precocious, pretend disdain giving way to a knowing smile before she fades back into sparking blackness. 
 The girls from Beauty Therapy are stretching their painted eyelids and looking down their lovely noses at the retreating boys and then, intrigue and dissin' sparkling between their spidery lashes, they notice me. Jade-rimmed, attention grabbing eyes - setting off their white coffee complexions to perfection - widen and then melt. I flick my eyes away, down to my black trainers, finding I am rooted to the spot.

Back in the midsts of time, Rob Jones and I started Snowbooks. Lots of people say 'ooh, aren't you brave?' Truth is, it wasn't brave at all - it was the only possible solution to our misery. We were stuck in jobs we hated, doing work we found pointless, with colleagues we couldn't respect and with no practical output. As management consultants, we wrote powerpoint presentations and tried to sell false promises to corporations. We didn't *do* anything, or *make* anything. It's a bleak, soul-crushing way to live. 

We started a publishing company because we wanted to do something that mattered - and given a choice of creating any product in the world, few matter more than books. Four years on, it's all going rather well. But looking to the future, we have a nagging doubt. If doing something to make a difference matters so much to us, are we sure that being a publisher is enough? 

The problem centres around what, exactly, a publisher does. We don't manufacture books -  we outsource that to printers. We don't warehouse or distribute our books, or process orders and payments - the wonderful LBS does that for us.","","","","","2007-08-15","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Nearly in double digits! Here's a (beautifully formatted - thank you!) snowcase submission from Juliet O'Callaghan. Juliet began her career as a nurse, then trained as a teacher of psychology. The opening pages of her first novel, about sex, guilt and dying, were long-listed in the UKA Press Competition.

The novel is How to Love Flynn. Ashley is dying; she writes a manual on how to love her husband, intended for Esther, his best friend, but then Kasia, the Nurse arrives...","How to love Flynn

Prologue - May 28th

<i>Ashley</i>

Egg timers. We've all got one filled with bitter salt, leeching life.

Mine's nearly run out. A little triangle of white grain is all that's left. Yours might be about to run out too. And you might know like I do, or you might not, like Diana and Dodi speeding through the Parisian night, orange flashes of concrete; closer, closer... Bam!

Whether you do or not oughtn't to matter because you can't turn it over and start again, but it does. I dream about buses.  I step off the pavement in front of a big red double decker and wake wondering why it is a London bus and not the Green Dart single decker of the Home Counties.

Of course, I have time to say goodbye. My family, studded like odd buttons across the meadow at my feet have time for closure, have time to make their peace. At my funeral they will sob whilst patting each others shoulders and whisper: At least we had time to say goodbye, we were lucky.  Lucky! I won't be feeling lucky!  I won't feel anything at all. I will not be. And this is all I can think about in between the gasping, drowning fear of pain. Will it hurt? Will I claw the air?

Will I know that I am about to take my final breath?   I have too much time to think, yet, I have too little time to live.

The hot wind rushes across the hillside and whips at my hair, bringing the itchy scent of rapeseed from the field beyond the rumble and roar of the motorway; impossibly yellow, it stings my eyes. I look down on my grave. Three months. A rough guide. A guesstimate. Doctors don't like putting time frames on things like that; it implies they have more control than they really do.  Life and death. They're not even certain when either begin. Too many incidents of the 'dead' awakening after being frozen under ice; or, limbs twitching on the cold morgue slab; and, only yesterday, a tiny baby placed into its mothers arms for a heart numbing goodbye, starts to suckle, comes back to life.  I have to make sure I am dead, dead.

The grassy hillocks rebound under my feet as I begin the descent.

Flynn waves and his hand flickers reminding me of the whirring, clicking images of Grace and I cart wheeling across daisy lawns and chasing butterflies in bamboo stick nets.  Sisters, frozen in time on a cine film from a faraway summer, when we believed we had forever.

Three months or thereabouts. I should be dead by the end of July, which would be ideal for Flynn; he could have me buried before term starts and then be too busy scolding the next generation to mourn.
It's highly possible of course that I won't make it to the end of July, or I might go on for another six months and see Christmas. As I've said, doctors don't like to give prognoses; it's the families that demand them.

I'll tell you what's a little weird: writing a piece for a newspaper or magazine and having to wait for it to be published to find out what you said. I understand that editors will want to correct mistakes, but every time I see something I wrote in print (novels excluded) it's changed in ways both inexplicable and frustrating. Sometimes expressions I wouldn't use have appeared; sometimes conclusions I wouldn't have drawn have been added. My least favourite was when someone went through a humorous piece I'd written and removed all the setups while leaving the punchlines. Anyone reading it would have assumed I was a moron. And not a funny moron either. Perhaps there's some reason that the world has to be this way. And perhaps telling you beforehand - never mind asking permission - is impossible. But I think I'd prefer it if whoever edited me added their names to the credits at the top. Then it would be clear that I'm not the only moron involved.","","","","","2007-08-15","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

The author of Snowcase #10, Anthony Black, is a former army officer and disaffected journalist. He has sent in 'The Failure', a 60,000 word novel.

A powerful metaphor for the Iraq war? Or the drunken ramblings of an angry newsreader?","The Failure

I watch the news in the evening. The tsunami in South-East Asia is dominating the headlines. The footage is horrific, as expected, reinforcing my opinion of the outside world as a place to be avoided. Since going into broadcast journalism (I read the morning news at a local radio station; thats important), I breakfast on nothing but shit and misery, a diet which tends to dampen the appetite.

After the news I watch a programme called <i>What I Wish I'd Known When I Was Younger</i>. It's full of celebrities (but not the talentless, wanky kind) in their fifties and sixties, doling out wisdom. According to the radio presenter John Peel (recently deceased), it's all about 'finding a level, and operating on that level'. Finding happiness, that is. Resonates with me, because I've obviously not found my level.

Actually, that's not true. I am a newsreader, at least. (I do enjoy doing it, despite what I just said about it disagreeing with me. Perhaps it just compliments my already gloomy disposition. Anyway, I like the sound of my own voice. There, I said it.)

Unfortunately, reading the news is not enough for me. I want more than that. A higher level. I'm not just talking about happiness. I'm talking about something else.

<i>Boat drinks and bunny girls</i>.

I don't know where that came from, I really don't.

I go to work the next morning. The death toll is rising in South-East Asia. 

I watch a TV report from Banda Ache in Sumatra, where entire villages have been flattened. The correspondent describes a large, upturned boat in the harbour as 'smelling of lost souls'. What a twat.

Mid-morning, I start to get these pains in my chest. With a few minutes to go before my 11am bulletin, I ransack the newsroom, looking for the first aid box. I want some aspirin. Apparently that's the thing to take if you're having a heart attack.

I don't find any aspirin. I read the 11am bulletin unmedicated. It goes okay, the pain gradually dying away.

I decide maybe it was indigestion.

I go home at lunchtime and go for a run. My usual. Just over 3 miles, to the next village and back. Gets the old heart pumping again.

Post-lunch, I drink four cans of Carling, two bottles of Becks and a can of Heineken. A healthy, refreshing mix of lagers. I down most of them in front of the TV in my dressing gown.

This is all part of the journey. Greatness will come in its own time.

Mike Manson has had two non-fiction books published. This is his first novel.'This isn't my story,' he says. He has to.  He signed the Official Secrets Act.

Max doesn't work. Now he's been offered a job  - in the dole office. The hot summer of '76; the dole office; cider and a riot.","<em>Where's My Money?</em>

Mr Blunt handed me a diagram of the civil service career structure.
'These are the opportunities that are open to you.' The gloom momentarily lifted from his face and he smiled a beatific smile.

There were about 40 grades. I was pleased to see that I was already about fifteen rungs up from the bottom of the ladder - above cleaner; porter, janitor, storeman, stationery assistant, paper wallah, tea monkey, and so on. Thank goodness for a university education.

'Think of this as a map of your life. It's all here, from youth to maturity; from clerical assistant to regional manager. Very few people are in such a privileged position to see their future charted like this.'

I shuddered. It was as if some hideous old crone had read my palm and identified the precise cause and date of my death.

'I want to tell you something very important about this job.'  Mr Blunt's voice softened. 'You know, one of my earliest memories as a young lad was walking with my father past this very building. I remember seeing a queue of rough unshaven men. Of course I was too young to know what a dole office was. To my inexperienced eyes I thought those pale and thin flat-capped men looked rather sad. My father, who owned a busy hardware shop in Castle Street, knew better.  Do you know what he said? I'll never forget it. He said: 'they need to get off their backsides. They're work shy; there's plenty of work to be done.' And do you know he was right. Even in those days.

'So this is my advice, Mr Redcliffe. Don't ever waste your time feeling sorry for these people.' He glanced over at the window. 'I see them arrive by taxi to sign-on. I can't afford to travel by taxi. How can they?  And when they leave the building I see them laughing. Do you know why they are laughing?  They are laughing at you and they are laughing at me.  And worst of all they are laughing at the system. I see them. Pimps, prostitutes, pariahs.' Mr Blunt spat out these sour words as if he'd bitten on a lemon.

'We must crack down on these scroungers.  The Government has high hopes for this department; for the foreseeable future unemployment is going to be increasing. We have ambitious targets that must be met. Mr Redcliffe, these targets will not be hit if staff are allowed to be too soft.'

Mr Blunt leant back in his chair, put his hands together behind his neck and closed his eyes. It was an alarming sight. His eyeballs, which had previously been magnified by his glasses into comic proportions, were replaced by a flesh coloured nothingness. 

'Mr Redcliffe,' he said languidly with his eyes still shut, 'why didn't you tell us about your little incident with the authorities?'

A tingle of alarm shot up my backbone. This was the last thing I'd been expecting. I then remembered Baxter's conversation about MI5 when I was completing my application form. Is that what Baxter had been hinting at?

'Excuse me?'

Mr Blunt opened his eyes. 'Let's just say that I know, and leave it at that.'

'I'm sorry, but what are you are referring to?'

'I think it's best if we leave it at that, don't you?

I was only too pleased to leave it at that seeing that I had no idea what he was on about. But then again, maybe I did.

'Now, Mr Redcliffe, I'll be seeing you again in few weeks' time for your initial Job Appraisal Review. We will talk about your long-term training needs then. Welcome to the Department of Work. My door is always open.'

He gestured with a flip of his hand for me to get out.

Rebecca Connell is 27 and has already gone through three careers as an agent's assistant, a TV producer and a brand consultant. She is more consistent when it comes to writing, she says! She has submitted THE ART OF LOSING to the Snowcase. 

Undercover, Louise grows close to the man with whom her late mother had an affair twenty years earlier - and the secrets she discovers have the potential to rewrite her past.","THE ART OF LOSING
Louise, 2007

<i>There is so much to say, and what I could say would never be enough. I see you now for what you are: selfish, complacent, cold, poisonous, evil. I only regret that it has taken me this long to end what should never have begun.

The first time I saw you, I knew that I would always love you. But sometimes over time the things we know unravel into nothing more than the things we thought we knew. This time I was wrong.</i>

These words are always with me. They run through my head as I talk, an almost-heard undercurrent bubbling just beneath consciousness. Sitting on the train, soaking in other peoples' heat and sweat, I tap them on an imaginary keyboard, my fingers digging privately into my palm.
Close to my heart, I keep them folded up tightly in their fading letter paper everywhere I go.

The name at the top of this letter is not mine. The name at the bottom belongs to a man whose face I can barely remember. Both these things will soon change.

****

I exercise it rarely, this talent I have. Scurrying down darkening streets, shivering as rain moulds to my shoulders, my muscles relax into a familiar rhythm. I'm a dancer remembering a long-forgotten dance, a gymnast whose body instinctively recalls twists and turns set aside many years ago. At school, I used to play this same game, skulking behind an admired teacher from classroom to car park, always a few steps behind. As he unlocked his car and drove away I would be watching from the damp cluster of trees, my breath still shallow from the excitement of the pursuit. I have this talent for following. He never noticed me.

The man I am following now is just as oblivious. He thinks he is alone, but ever since he left the lecture hall, I've been with him.
Down the high street, I slide in and out of the crowds like mercury, his heavy burgundy coat glinting wetly ahead like a jewel. I want to be wrapped up in his coat, engulfed in its warmth. It would swamp me; he must be six foot two, a clear eight inches above me. It would smell of  what? Cigarettes: I saw him light up as he left the hall, cupping his hand to shield the tiny flame. Lost in thought, I'm getting too close. I hang back as his pace slows, counting my steps in my head.

Abruptly he stops, as if hearing his name called. I shrink back into a doorway and watch as he puts a hand to the back of his neck. He's forgotten something perhaps, a book, an umbrella, a scarf. No. He's simply forgotten himself - passed his destination. He hurries back and ducks into a brightly coloured cafe, swinging the door shut. I wait a few moments, then sidle up to the cafe, leaning back against its wet orange wall.

He has submitted TWILIGHT. Thomas Twilight is an American detective with a difference, a man undergoing a severe mid-life crisis while trying to cope with the eccentricities of living in the mad city that is 2006 London...","TWILIGHT excerpt from Chapter 1

Peggy was lying naked and face down on my bed as she felt the bruise on her backside with her left hand.

       'You hurt me, Tommy,' she complained peevishly.

       'You damn well deserved it, jumping out at me like that,' I muttered in response. Yet I was feeling bad; I had given her ass a hell of a crack with the flat of my right hand after I'd recovered from my shock in the bathroom. 'Is it bad? Let me see.'

       She allowed me to examine her rump. It was as delectable a Chinese ass as ever but the size of the disfiguring bruise I'd given her did worry me. I wanted to explain about what had just happened on the street beforehand that had spooked me so much, but it sounded like a weak excuse for what I'd done.

       'I could kiss it better,' I suggested hopefully.

       'You will not!' she said severely. 'You'd only enjoy yourself even more than you have already tonight.'

       'Why did you jump out on me like that, then?'

       She shrugged petulantly. 'I was taking a bath, making myself nice and fragrant for you, when I heard you coming up the stairs. So I switched the light out; I thought it would be a lovely surprise for you.'

       'It was,' I assured her, 'after I recovered from the heart attack anyway.'

       Peggy really is a wonderful girl, and the only person I will ever allow to call me Tommy. I give her this leeway because she is gorgeous and slender and smart and sassy. Her real name is No Choi Yim and she is a Malay Chinese from the Pearl of the Orient, the island of Penang. She is also thirty-two years old although she looks about seventeen (particularly when naked), and she is as truly clever as only the Chinese can be.

       I've often wondered why a girl like Peggy would exchange an island paradise like Penang for the dubious benefits of crime-ridden London, but then she has made crime her business. (It is London's one real growth industry after all.) Peggy came to London in 1995 to do a PhD in microbiology and genetics at Imperial College, and is now one of the foremost experts on DNA fingerprinting in the entire world. She is the forensic scientist in charge of the Metropolitan Police's genetic testing laboratory, and shoots off to high-powered conferences all around the world. But the thing that pleases her most is that, because of her qualification, she now shares her name with a famous James Bond villain... 

       My Dr No doesn't want to take over the world, though - not as far as I know anyway - but she can still be scary enough in her own way, and sex with her has probably left me permanently scarred in more ways than one, particularly when her scarlet fingernails rake my back. For such a petite and sweet-looking woman she has an insatiable and voracious sexual appetite. I have suggested occasionally that she should change her name to the more appropriate Pussy Galore but so far that idea hasn't found favour with her...

Hannah G. Davies is a freelance arts journalist living in London. She has never knowingly misplaced any friends or family members. Statues is her first novel.

Kate has misplaced her father; Alice has lost her best friend. This is the story of their search.","Statues

Kate wondered whether her neighbour knew that she intended to kill him. She hoped so. The idea that he could somehow sense her hatred was comforting, as if there was a connection between them. She disliked feeling alone, and sitting here in her kitchen at four o'clock in the morning, she was dangerously close to loneliness. Her neighbour's music was thudding off the walls, ricocheting off mugs and glasses that were so neatly arranged on the shelves, and periodically slamming into her brain. It had been this way ever since her first night in the flat, but she had not wanted to kill him then. She had felt that there was a chance of resolution, if only she could make him understand how loud the music sounded inside her flat, how much it was impacting on her carefully thought-out life. After forty-eight days she realised that it was not that he did not understand; it was that he did not care. Thirty-two days after this revelation she decided that he had to die. Kate was aware that many people would insist that she did not have the right to decide whether her neighbour lived or died, policemen and crown prosecutors being the most obvious dissenters and the most likely to impinge on her life, post-murder-of-neighbour.

Perhaps, Kate occasionally reflected, she ought to consider the philosophical implications. After eighty nights without sleep, however, that was as far as her mind would take her. She accepted that there were philosophical, not to mention moral, questions surrounding her decision, but she was frankly too tired to consider what they might be.

Of course, she was not interested in a purely practical solution. Were that so, she could have simply moved out before the lease was up, and swallowed the resulting financial penalties as a price worth paying for the recovery of her sanity. The point was that Kate also wanted revenge. Her neighbour had embarked on an eighty-day programme to dismantle her personality by brutal noise terrorism, and she could not allow him to walk away. City life, she had thought - before enforced sleep deprivation rendered thought impossible - brought with it responsibilities. Jammed together on trains and buses, inhaling each other's recycled breath courtesy of the office air-conditioning, pressing together in sandwich shops at lunchtimes, walking shoulder-to-shoulder on the thin routes home, and queuing, queuing, queuing all of this, all these connections, required a delicate sense of self and other; respecting the otherness of the other while tending to the selfish needs of the self. Anybody who could not understand this, who could not live amongst others without imposing himself to an unacceptable degree, must be punished and removed. The removal would constitute the punishment. Or, to put it more simply: Kate's neighbour was making her life hell, and so he had to die. She should not have to sit alone at the stained kitchen table at four in the morning, with this hell in her head and in her heart. All routes led back to this.

She felt exposed to the elements, as if the music had, howling, torn the roof from her home.

Gillian McDade is from Northern Ireland and has been working as a journalist for nine years. She has completed her first novel <em>Losing Patience </em>and has started work on a follow-up.

Patience is a klutzy reporter working at The Daily Times but when she is sent to cover a breaking news story in Afghanistan, she manages to cause an international terrorism alert.","<em>Prologue</em>
Paris, November 9, 2009, 4pm:
'She said she thought it was Al Qaeda,' Barbs announced, hanging up on Patience.
'Who?'
'Al Qaeda. The American singer, the one who sang...' Barbs paused.
'No, no, that's Al Jolson.'
'Oh, ok,' said Barbs. 'I stand corrected. There's so much noise in the background. I can't seem to hear her very well. Right, where were we?' said Barbs, forgetting her friend was in dire straits. 'The Da Vinci Code tour, this way. Let's go.'
*
Flight AM193 - 7pm local time:
Pressing the 'end call to Barbara' button on her mobile phone, Patience looked at her delicate white fingers which were shaking. The box sat on the pull-down tray.
'What's that?'
'It was given to me. I thought at first it was the black box recorder from United 93, but it's not,' said Patience shaking her head. 'Look what's inside though. It's a sign.'
She looked at the frightened passenger beside her.
'Wow, it's ticking,' said Marianne, pulling a crumpled tissue from her Mulberry bag to mop her swollen eyes.  The gallimaufry of voices swirled around in Patience's head like a drunken kaleidoscope.

*
<em>The White House, 1pm:</em>
'Is it necessary? I don't think so,' said the president. 'There's no need for it to be shot down. Not now.'
A taut blanket of silence fell on The Oval Office.
'Have the organisers called off tomorrow's march?'
'Not as far as we know ma'am,' said the agent. 'A full scale search of the area will be carried out before anything goes ahead anyway. We've no knowledge of anyone wanting to attack the marchers. I know there are several protests planned for the Capitol Hill area, but they are low-key and I'm keen to emphasise that point.'
The president felt she should stay put.
'It's my duty as president to remain in the United States for the meantime. 
Given the current incident, I'll need to call off the meeting with President Chirac at the weekend. Tell Etienne I'll re-arrange the appointment, and please apologise to her for the inconvenience,' said the president. 
'Unfortunately it's out of my control.'
'Yes ma'am.'
The news continued. A terse voice read the autocue.
'The official opening of the new wing of the Louvre, housing a lost painting by Leonardo Da Vinci, has just been postponed to allow the president to remain in the United States...'
The once magnificent Empire State Building continued to smoulder. The president watched the scenes on television intently, absorbing the shock. Video footage showed the thick smoke belching out of the eighty-sixth floor observatory, emanating from the wreckage of the small aircraft which appeared to have left a gaping wound a few floors below. The news continued:
'Homes in the area have been evacuated, but most people have chosen to flee for safety as timely reminders of September 11 have emerged. Earlier there were distressing scenes as workers and tourists ran through the streets to get away from the inferno.'
The president took a deep breath as she watched the live images of people running through the streets in a bid to escape the choking smoke which was eagerly chasing them like a goring bull.

          <div style=""margin-left: 20px; color: #660000;""><em>Blogger spots Nasa's climate error</em>
          * Amateur discovers 1934, not 1998, is hottest year
          * Climatologists insist trend is still towards warming</div>

I particularly like the 'Climatologists insist' bit. You really get the sense that their views are under pressure and they're trying not to crumble.","The start of the article looks even worse:
<div style=""margin-left: 20px; color: #660000;"">""An amateur meteorologist in Canada has embarrassed Nasa scientists into admitting that some of the data they used to show significant recent increases in global warming is flawed.</div>

<div style=""margin-left: 20px; color: #660000;"">""As a result of Stephen McIntyre's calculations, climatologists at the Goddard Institute of Space Science in New York now accept that 1934 was historically the United States' hottest year since records began, not 1998 as they had claimed. It also turns out that five of the 10 warmest years on record in the US occurred before 1939, and only one is from the 21st century, raising questions over the statistics used in Al Gore's environmental film An Inconvenient Truth to highlight the faster pace of climate change.""</div>

But if you read all the way to the end, you get one or two little footnotes which kinda sorta totally reverse the sense of the article:
<div style=""margin-left: 20px; color: #660000;"">""Climate researchers...[say] the differences in the recalculated temperatures, hundredths of one degree, are so insignificant as to have no impact on the overall trend towards global warming.... [they] also noted that the error related only to figures from the US, covering just 2% of the Earth's surface, so could not be applied globally.""</div>

Is that what it takes to 'raise questions' over the statistics Al Gore used to highlight the faster pace of climate change? Statistically insignificant errors in 2% of the data? You might have thought it would take a bit more than that. But this isn't about the truth; that's not the point. The point is, there's still doubt about whether man-made climate change is real. That's what you're supposed to take away from this. That doubt may not have any bearing on the predicament we're in, but for those who like to say scientists aren't sure, no one knows, it might be nothing, these sorts of newspaper articles are vital and they keep appearing. The only difference is that they used to challenge the consensus regarding man-made climate change and now they have to content themselves with criticising the workings-out and the P.R. skills of those involved. It's not much, but if it helps us put off taking action for a little while longer then it will have served its purpose.","","","","2007-08-16","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

The Snowcase is very popular, very popular indeed. Hooray! I particularly like that people are commenting on the posts - just as I hoped. There's a piece Emob* wrote for <a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/blogs/43751-snowcasing-new-talent.html"">the Bookseller here. </a>

Thing is, it's *so* popular that this blog is in danger of becoming one long list of Snowcases. Plus, even though you've been angels with your formatting, it takes five or ten minutes to format and post each one - and ten minutes really adds up when there's a lot of posting to be done. So, to keep things on an even keel, I'm going to update the blog with Snowcases once a week. We wondered which day we should choose. Although Rob's suggestion for a catchy alliterative title - Fiction F'ursday - was very good, very good indeed, we decided in the end on Fiction Friday. There should be sufficient to keep you going throughout the week, and should allow me to actually get on with some work. 

*Emob: a concatenation of Emma and Rob. We are a team. Could also have been Roma, or Erob, or Emmarob... oh, you get the gist.","On a similar note, the Free Books Club is doing very well indeed - so well, in fact, that stocks in the office are running low. So I'm going to amend it to this: you can still have a free book, but only if you buy another one. Since most of you have kindly said you're going to buy our books anyway that shouldn't be too much of a nuisance. 

Also, I have to say I've been disappointed with a few of the requests for free books. The vast majority of people have been lovely and friendly, and have said thank you. A minority have stated the name of the book, their address and left it at that. I suppose that people are used to dealing with large companies, and don't imagine that there's a human being at the other end, but, well, there are only three of us. Giving friends of the blog free books is supposed to be a bit of a treat. It's certainly not going to make us any money because of the part where it's free. So my new plan is this: I'll give priority to the nicest people and make the rude, grabby ones wait a bit. If the free books you've asked for take ages to arrive it's probably time to call your mum and ask her to give you that speech about saying please and thank you just one last time. I'm sure she won't mind. Whereas if your free book turns up promptly, you'll know it's because you're a polite person who gets on well with other people - and you can tell everyone we said so.","","","","2007-08-16","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"
"41101","","1","What's the truth about Chavez?","Publish","true","<img src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/p.gif""/> For anyone new to the blog, I put a green 'p' next to political posts so that them as don't want to read 'em don't have to. Not even a little bit by accident.","I don't much like reading about the history of Latin America; too much of it reflects very badly on the West. The U.S. in particular has a nasty habit of getting rid of leaders it doesn't like in that part of the world. Arbenz in Guatemala and Zelaya in Nicaragua. And while they'll be called madmen and dictators in the press, these are democratically-elected social-reformers we're talking about. Just the sort of thing we say we promote and just the sort of thing those countries needed. It's the people we get to replace them that are the dictators.

The pattern is familiar from elsewhere in the world. Someone gets elected on a reformist ticket and notices that most of the country's wealth belongs to foreign businesses. They also note that a good chunk of their citizenry is on the poverty line. So they take the fateful step of trying to use their country's resources in the service of the country's citizens. Bad move.

The first thing the dispossessed corporations do is complain to the government in their home country. If those corporations are big and American they'll have a couple of vocal senators to speak up for them who'll point out that someone 'hostile to American interests' is in power and insist that something must be done. 'Hostile to American interests' sound like it means WMD or something, but half the time it just means they won't honour the agreements to be robbed their puppet predecessor signed. The 'something that must be done' on more than one occasion has ended up being a CIA project to fund opponents of the foreign leader and - if it comes to it - to install a dictator who will do as they're told. 

Evil? Yes of course it is. And Britain would do that stuff like a shot if it had the resources, but mainly it can only watch America overthrow democracies and sigh enviously. 

The more recent version of that game has been to lend money to desperate countries via the IMF and then to make one or two rules about how the recipients must behave. One or two suicidal rules. If you want the loans you have to agree to all sorts of dangerous things - things that no Western country would ever consider doing. Drop all your import and export tariffs, allow foreign ownership of everything, then allow foreign money to leave the country unfettered if problems arise - and problems most assuredly will arise. And then there's some small print about not spending money on reckless frivolities like medicine and food for the sick and hungry. That last one is what, according to Economics Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, guarantees there'll be food riots in countries receiving IMF 'assistance'.

Sadly for the loan recipients, these insane rules have never yet fixed an economy. In fact they've torpedoed over two dozen of them, which is exactly what you'd expect them to do. But the mostly American IMF investors generally get their money back, and Wall Street gets to loot an entire nation. Forcing a developing country to go head-to-head in trade terms with the rest of the world - without the protection of trade tariffs - has never yet produced an economic force that can rival America. Imagine. It's only ever destroyed the economy of the countries forced to try it. And there's more good news - the lenders not only (eventually) get their money back, help their friends to loot a nation and reassert their dominance of trade in the hemisphere, they also end up with a country that owes them oodles of money and can't pay. It can't pay, of course, because the strings attached to the IMF loan throttled their economy. So loan 'negotiations' become an immensely powerful way of exerting influence in the region. You can't really say no to America when you owe them so much money.

But since Hugo Chavez was elected as leader of Venezuela, none of those things have happened his country. U.S. adventures in Iraq have pushed the price of oil up to the level where Venezuela's oil reserves are worth exploiting. If oil was cheap, it wouldn't be profitable to extract it; but oil is as dear as it's ever been and that makes Venezuela's massive reserves suddenly worth an absolute fortune.

And what is Chavez spending the money on? Well, he wants to offer education to everyone for a start - everyone, no matter how old or poor. And train doctors; he likes doing that. And he's been offering Venezuelan loans to his neighbours so that they won't have to go to America's pet loan shark, the IMF. And selling cheap fuel to the poor - the monster. He wants to set up a regional trade zone, free from America's control, and to bring the southern Americas into the twenty-first century - and he wants to do it along socialist lines where the people, and not just the corporations, benefit.

What else? Well, he also spends a lot of time talking about how America wants to kill him. Which makes him sound a little bit crazy. Except that America does have a bit of a thing for killing foreign leaders who annoy them. Every time the CIA declassifies another piece of its history we learn about another one. Oh, and Chavez <em>was</em> kidnapped for a little while during a coup attempt in 2002 and it turned out that Washington was lending a hand. Democracy, shemocracy, as they say in U.S. foreign policy circles.

It all seems too good to be true if you ask me. Which is why it's troubling to read stories about Chavez wanting to scrap term limits so that he can keep running the country forever. And about how he has his own weekly unscripted TV show where he rambles on about how great he is and how much he's done for the country. And worst of all is the news that he shut down a whole TV network for disagreeing with him. Most of the Western press agree: he might have repeatedly won the popular vote in free elections but he's well on his way to becoming a dictator now.

I don't know what to make of it. South America should have a lot fewer poor people than it does and vigorously pro-trade and pro-socialist governments seem like just what the region needs. America and the IMF have both exerted their influence to do enormous harm there and I think Latin America would be much better off without them. On the other hand, egomaniacal cult-of-personality dictators are not the solution.

So it was with interest that I read <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/columns/title/Mark%20Weisbrot%20Economy%20and%20Policy%20Column/eyes-wide-shut-the-international-media-looks-at-venezuela.htm"">this article</a> in the International Business Times which explains Chavez didn't shut down a TV network that 'disagreed' with him - it's still broadcasting. No, he refused to renew the monopoly of a TV network that had called for a coup against him in the past. Now that network will face more competition. And yet I could have sworn that I read in all sorts of newspapers about how he'd stifled the free press when they disagreed with him. For all I know, he might still turn out to be a bad man, but I have to say, it'll take more than the usual pack of lies that comprises most mainstream foreign reporting to make me believe it.","","","","2007-08-17","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Anita Sivakumaran is a PHD student in the department of Creative writing in Lancaster University. She has always wanted to be a writer, and ""isn't qualified to be anything else"". 'The Ghost That Killed Babu' is her first novel, literary in intent.

Kavitha returns to Madras after years of trying to stay away. A ghost killed her childhood friend. Or was it her brother? A ghost tried to kill her brother. Or was it her?

The Ghost That Killed Babu","Chapter 1
The Day Babu Died

The day Babu died was the hottest day in all the year. The kitsch Krishna calendar on Paatti's wall announced with a fat asterisk that it was the day of the Agni Nattrachatram, the Fire Star.

The previous fortnight, almost seven hundred people from the neighbouring state of Andhra Pradesh had succumbed to the heat wave.
They died of dehydration while working in farmlands and construction sites, or while pulling rickshaws on sticky tar roads. Chief Minister NTR held a press conference to which he arrived dressed in three shades of saffron and gave a speech advising people to stay indoors and drink plenty of water till cooler weather returned.

Dry winds caused by low pressure in the Bay of Bengal had blown down trees and ripped apart power lines in Madras, costing the city corporation close to sixty lakhs in damage. Men complained about the unscheduled power cuts, leaning back in armchairs and fanning themselves with newspapers, while wives came and went carrying steel lottas of cool water, the armpits of their blouses darkened in a sexy spread of perspiration.

But Babu didn't die of the heat. He drowned in the river.

Sindoori Chitti had warned the children that it was going to be a very hot day. The previous afternoon, she had given them each a large lotta of buttermilk spiced with salt and asafoetida and had advised them to play in the shade. She knew they were going fishing, early in the morning and without any adults, but she didn't mind, and Paatti and Periyamma didn't mind either.

They didn't mind because the river Puyalaru had shrunk so much in the recent years, the water in it wouldn't drown a tea cup. It looked less a river and more a muddy little stream in a vast tract of arid land.
For even the December rains had started to fail, and as far as the eyes could see, Mother Nature in her every manifestation was wilting and crumbling like dried up pods of cow dung.

Kavitha didn't get to go fishing with Babu, because Anand had tricked her into staying behind. Paatti said it was really lucky that she had stayed behind. Being the smaller child and known for her clumsiness, it could have easily been her who had drowned. 

And Paatti said it was lucky for Anand as well, that it wasn't him who came under the eye of Yama riding his buffalo looking for victims to drag into the underworld. She said this three days after the funeral, and Sindoori Chitti told her it was a not a nice thing to say, in light of 'their suffering'. She was referring to Babu's family, who were only distant relatives, more neighbours than family. Kavitha didn't think it was lucky for her to have stayed behind. She thought Babu wouldn't have died if she had gone too. Wouldn't have been killed.

Keith Latch read his first novel, The Voice of the Night by Dean Koontz, at age twelve. Thus began his love affair with things that go bump in the night. He has submitted his novel, entitled BEST-SELLER, to the Snowcase. 

Rob Caulder has wanted to be a writer his entire life, but now he's learning: It's deadly at the top.","A stab of pain shot through him, from one temple to the other. Rob clamped his hands to his head at the ferocious and abrupt attack. When it subsided, the characters on the screen were dancing, moving almost as ants on bare earth. Suddenly the pieces fit. Rob stood. ""My father, he--""

""Crashed his motorcycle on a rainy September morning. Helmets weren't the law then, and he didn't wear one. Was in a coma for two weeks. When he finally woke. He said it was like living a never ending nightmare. For months, he slipped closer and closer to insanity.

   The Travel Inn Motor Lodge sat squat beside a four-lane highway. It was late evening, the lights of passing traffic blurring into rays of white and red. The smell of gasoline and diesel drifted far and wide. 

   He was in Iowa or Idaho, or maybe it was Michigan. He really didn't know anymore. More to the point, he didn't really care. A palm full of cash had dissuaded the desk clerk from asking too many questions. That was a good thing.

   The key to his room, 23, was attached to a wide odd-shaped piece of green plastic. The door creaked as he pushed open the door. It was an obscenely ugly room. The carpet was a burnt orange, the drapes a sickly dark green. But the overhead light worked when he flipped the switch. The bed was made and looked all too inviting.

   Before settling in, he went to his car for his bags. One was a green duffel bag, the kind the military issued. But he was not an army man, nor would he ever be. The ritual that such a life entailed nauseated him. The other wasn't truly a bag, but a case.

   Once back in the room, he removed items from the bag. A bottle of Jack Daniels. A small, tattered notebook, spiral-bound with a black, fading cover. A .38 Smith & Wesson revolver all loaded and ready to go.

   There was a television in the room, but he did not turn it on. His mind was full, it could hold no more. Beside the bed on a small, cheaply made table were a phone and alarm clock radio. Neither distraction appealed to him. There was not one person in the world that he wanted to talk to. And on the radio there would be nothing but the Bee Gees or some other mindless, stifling disco crap or worse, maybe even punk rock.

   He grabbed a glass from the sink area, rinsed the dust from it and poured it half full with liquor.

   Hed never been much of a drinker. Had never developed neither the taste nor the stomach for it.

   Still, he drained the glass before placing the hard black guitar case on the bed. It wasn't all that bad, really. He flipped open the fasteners and pulled out the instrument. The guitar had been a recent purchase while abroad. A 1978 Les Paul EG500. The color scheme was Cherryburst and it was about the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen in the world. 

   But the six-string was not a source of pride or of awe for him. It was simply a tool. A way of release.

   He cradled the guitar, the base over a knee and the fingerboard held lightly, almost lovingly in his left hand. He didn't use a pick; instead he pulled a shiny dime out of his pocket. Automatically his left hand hit a chord and he strummed the dime over the strings. The guitar made a metallic clanging sound, nothing like it would if hooked to an amplifier.

The servants were whispering in the corner again. Next door, in the kitchen, the cook was talking in a low voice to the  dhobi as she ground spices for the day. Birds squawked in the distance, rising above the trees in a flutter of leaves and wings. The air was thick with heat and words.

Marie ate her breakfast in silence. The boys were already playing cricket out in the compound, despite the early hour, no doubt relishing in the first taste of summer's freedom. As Marie had dressed she had heard Peter cajoling William to get out of bed and join him outside. Their voices were now raised in triumph while their sister slept on upstairs. She bit into a slice of mango, expecting soft, yielding flesh. It was hard, not yet ripe.

'Prita,' she said, her voice harsher than she had intended. The girls sprang apart guiltily. Sunita ran into the hallway, her head bowed.
'Prita, this mango is not right.'

'Sorry, Mrs Abel,' Prita replied, her cheeks flushed. She moved to clear the pale fleshed fruit away as Marie touched her arm.

'Tell me, what is wrong?'

'With the mango, Mrs Abel?' The girl shrank from Marie's gaze, extracting herself from her grip.

'No, Prita, not the mango. There is something else.' Marie sighed. 'I heard you talking a minute ago, so don't you tell me that nothing is wrong.'

'There is -' Prita stopped and checked herself. 'Just talk, Mrs Abel, just talk. Nothing important.'

'If it were a matter of concern-'

'Of course, Mrs Abel.' Prita smiled brightly. 'Now, you would like me to clear away?'

Marie hesitated, feeling an opportunity for truth slipping away from her like rice through her fingers. 'Yes, yes.' The girl's face flickered briefly with relief. Yes, there was quite definitely something wrong - the air was too still, as though the house were holding its breath around her.

She found Thomas in the study, his desk covered in letters. The scent of the jasmine flowers drifted lazily through the open window. Marie's feet squeaked on the freshly cleaned floor as she made her way over to stand at his shoulder.

'Maybe you should take the children to Juhu,' he said, not moving his eyes from the letter in front of him. 'Have a walk, some bhel puri.
It'll be good for them, yes?'

'Really?'

'I think you ought to. After lunch.'

'What about you?'

'No. I have a few things to sort out.'

'You can't be intending to work all day.'

'I have some important things to do that can't be put off.'

Marie stared at her husband's back, uncomprehending. 'But you said -'

'I know.' Thomas threw the letter back down onto the table, his brow wrinkled.

'The boys -' Marie paused to collect her thoughts. 'They've only just got back for the holidays. I promised them that we'd all do something together. They were looking forward to it.'

'They'll just have to wait.'

I had to post this article from the Guardian in its entirety, because it made me inexplicably happy. The inclusion of the phrase ""tasty morsel"" and the indepth discussion around long sticks / short sticks were just lovely. Go you crows!

<strong>Crows match great apes in skilful tool use</strong>

 - Task revealed Caledonian crows' advanced logic
 -  Birds' strategy echoes early human evolution
<em>James Randerson, science correspondent The Guardian Friday August 17 2007 </em>

A tool-using strategy that was key to the advancement of early humans has been observed by scientists in a bird. ""Metatool use"", the ability to use one tool on another, is something that humans and great apes such as chimps and orang-utans are capable of, but with which monkeys struggle.","However, a study has shown that New Caledonian crows can manage this task easily. Researchers offered the crows a tasty morsel of meat that was out of reach in a box. To reach the food the birds had to use a long stick. But this stick was inaccessible in another box. To reach the long stick, the birds had to prise it out with a smaller stick which they could reach.

""It was surprising to find that these creatures performed at the same levels as the best performances by great apes on such a difficult problem,"" said Russell Gray, of the University of Auckland, New Zealand. ""Six out of seven birds tried to get the long stick with the short stick at their first attempt at solving the problem."" 

The test revealed that the birds knew the short stick was too small to reach the food but that the longer stick would solve the problem. ""They had to inhibit their normal response of trying to get the food directly with the short stick and realise that they could use the short stick to get the long stick,"" he said. New Caledonian crows previously have been shown to adapt tools for a specific job, something only a few primates can manage. Chimpanzees are the most adept ape tool-users apart from humans, using spears to hunt bushbabies, rocks to crack nuts and sticks to fish for termites.

Metatool use, involving making more complex and useful tools, was vital in our ancestors' development, say the researchers. ""[It] may reflect the 'cognitive leap' that initiated technological evolution,"" they write in the journal Current Biology.

The ability is conceptually hard, they argue, because the applying of one tool to another represents another step removed from the goal itself . First the animal has to realise that tools can be used on non-food objects, second it has to suppress the urge to go straight for the food itself, and third, it has to perform a sequence of actions in the correct order. 

And, to see the solution to the problem, requires ""analogical reasoning"", the ability to see a new situation as essentially similar to a previous one. 

To ensure the birds were not simply probing randomly with the short stick and getting the long stick by trial and error, the test involved yet another box with a stone inside. Only one bird tried poking the short stick into this box - and that was after she had already solved the problem.

Kris Williams started writing Ghost Port for his son Oscar, intending for it to be a personalised bedtime story. Three years later it has grown into the first of a planned series.

Ghost Port is a scary place. Ask Oscar J. Pennicot: in just two days he has been attacked by zombies and pirate ghosts, and buried alive.","Ghost Port - Chapter One

The wind pawed at the tent, pulling the ropes tight against the pegs. Two people lay huddled together inside the cramped shelter, exhausted and freezing.  Oscar couldn't hear the remaining huskies any more.  He feared they were dead like the others.
'I'm so hungry, Ma.'
'Just a minute,' Marie put a gloved hand into the front of her huge jacket, and retrieved a small piece of mint cake.
'I thought we were out of rations?' whispered the boy.
'I've been saving this piece for when things got really bad.  I'd say our situation fits the bill, wouldn't you?'  She smiled but Oscar could see sadness in her eyes.  She had never looked so tired to him.  Her face was gaunt, and her pale skin looked thin.
'Now come on, eat.'
'What about you, Ma?'
'Oh I'm not hungry,' she lied. 'Besides, your Pa will be back soon.  He'll bring food and help.  We'll soon be out of this mess, warming ourselves on an open fire.  Maybe we'll toast marshmallows.'  Marie hoped she sounded convincing to her son, because she didn't sound very convincing to herself.
Oscar digested the information, and then placed the sweet into his mouth.  
He swallowed it, and his stomach growled for more.
The blizzard raged on outside.  <em>How much longer can we survive this?</em>  Marie thought, watching her son shiver.

They had been trekking across the North Pole.  All had been going well, until the sixth day.  The attack had been swift and ferocious.  Marie found it hard to forget the sight of fresh blood splattered on crisp white snow.  
They had lost their guide and two dogs on that day.  Since then four more huskies had succumbed, during the long days spent lost in the vast whiteness of the Arctic.  When they could walk no more, they put down camp.

Then the storm came.  They had been grounded by the blizzard for two days, though it seemed longer.  With no more supplies left, Felix decided to go on alone to find help.  Marie had thought it would be a miracle if he survived, let alone managed to get to a settlement.  But what choice did they have?  They had to do something.

It all seemed like such a long time ago now.  She tried not to think about the emptiness that was growing in her belly like a bubble.  The tips of her fingers felt hot and numb, and her limbs heavy.  She was weak, too weak to move.  What would she do if her husband did not return?  She banished the thought quickly, not daring to dwell on what may happen if Felix didn't come back.  But it kept surfacing like a bad egg.  She was under no illusion; their situation had become desperate.  The numbness in her body was beginning to fill her head; her ears throbbed with a sharp pain that refused to ease.

Oscar closed his eyes.  His breathing had become shallow.  Realisation that there was nothing more she could do to help her son, bought a tear.  It trickled down her cheek, and onto Oscar's forehead.
'Ma?' he said in a breath, without opening his eyes.
'It's okay Oscar, I'm here.'
She embraced him, pulling him close, trying to get as much warmth from her body to his.  It was all she could do for him now.  She began to sing quietly, perhaps that would help.
The orange of the tent blurred into darkness, as Oscar drifted into a deep sleep.

Courtesy of Rob who <del>shared it with me</del> encouraged me to buy my own copy, I am currently listening to the Pirates of the Carribean soundtrack and it makes me want to go a-marauding. Bom, bom, bom. Cymbals! Violins going crazy. Yat ta tat tat. Here come the trumpets! Ahoy, me hearties! Oh, and the big chorus voices, as George Harrison called them. 

Rob, is there any way we can share a snippet with the snowblog readers? To get their bloods all fired up?

From Rob: Ahh, the irony of Em suggesting we flirt with music piracy because of pirate music. I barely dare to do this, knowing that media lawyers are like overcaffeinated t-rexs when it comes to copyright violations. But here's a <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Jack_Sparrow.mp3"">snippet</a>.

Michelle Fattig, author of the Annie Books series, is a school psychologist, and medical technologist, who volunteers as a parent advocate, and provides professional development to parents and educators.

The excerpt here is from A Prairie Day with Annie. Michelle says: ""The Annie Books are a must read for any parent, teacher, or student with the challenges of Attention Deficit Disorders.""","Chapter Two 
Crayon Marks, Ceiling Cracks, and a Wad of Gum

A hand on her shoulder interrupts Annie. 
Annie, Mrs. Jones repeats exasperated, I have been calling for you to come back to class.
Shaking her head, Annie looks around, same crayon marks on the wall, same cracks in the ceiling, same gum stuck under the door handle, no wait there was no gum there yesterday.Was there gum there yesterday?
I didnt see gum there yesterday, Annie murmurs.
It could have been there yesterday. 
Annnn-IE, more sternly this time.
Oh, sorry Mrs. Jones! Annie blurts out, as she jumps to her feet. 
Dusting herself off, Annie glances up to Mrs. Jones.
Mrs. Jones?  Annie ventures.
Mmm, yes Annie,? Mrs. Jones replies distractedly, trying to keep an eye on the class, as she waits for Annie to straighten herself.
Mrs. Jones, what do you think a minnow tastes like? Annie asks, looking brightly up at her teacher.
Wh-what?  What do you mean, what do I think a minnow tastes like?
Honestly Annie!  Did you spend any time thinking about WHY you were sitting out in the hallway?  Mrs. Jones looks positively apoplectic.  
Apoplectic.  Annie likes that word.
Last week, when mom made her stay in her room after getting the letter from Mrs. Jones about how the day went, Annie had looked through the As in the dictionary. One must figure out how to spend time in a constructive manner, when one is frequently banished to ones room.
Apoplectic had popped out at Annie. Apoplectic at rest, becalmed, dead, deadlocked, deathly, firm, fixed, frozen, halted, immobile, immotile, inanimate, inert, lifeless, numb, palsied, paralyzed, petrified, quiescent, quiet, spellbound, stable, stagnant, stalled, standing, static, stationary, steadfast, still, stock-still, torpid, transfixed, unmovable, unmoved, unmoving.  
What a simply MARVELOUS WORD!
Wait, what does torpid mean? A blank stare was the only response from Annie to Mrs. Jones question. 
Annie was still rolling the words around on her tongue, oblivious to the storm brewing in Mrs.Jones. Lets use this as a teaching moment.
Mrs. Jones has that hands on hips, bending slightly at the waist, earnest expression she frequently gets when speaking with Annie.
Annie looks back expectantly.
Well? prompts Mrs. Jones without changing posture.
Annie looks at her feet and shuffles a toe at a wadded up piece of writing paper.  She hadnt noticed the writing paper before.  It is a lined paper with writing visible. What was written on it? Was it a note? Maybe it was a note from Dougie to Annie, expressing his undying love. Dougie sits behind Annie.  He has reddish brown hair that sticks out of his head at all angles.  He has freckles and one of the biggest smiles Annie has ever seen.?I wonder if Dougie would have liked living on the prairie?
Annies imagination is at it again. 
Skipping brightly in the morning sunshine, Annie swings a pail in a great arcing motion.  Her long dark braids trail down her back and her bonnet still lies loosely about her shoulders. The pail is small and gray.  The little handle feels cool in her hand. Ma has tucked biscuits, an apple, and some jerked meat in the bottom for Annies lunch.  A checkered red and white kerchief is tucked around the food, keeping it from flies and from being crushed by
Annies careless transport.            
They will pump more fresh cool water at lunchtime.  Ma says it is so lucky that the little school has its very own pump.  Not many schools have them you know.  Thinking about her aching arms, Annie is not so sure that she would consider it altogether lucky!
There are very few trees about, and Annie can see far across the horizon.  Tall prairie grass sways gently in the breeze.
Annie loves the feeling of the sun and breeze on her cheeks.  Ma will, of course, scold her for not covering up with her bonnet when she sees her pink cheeks! As Annie cavorts along, she notices a boy strolling towards her.  The boy is wearing a plaid cotton shirt, and stiff looking jeans, that are slightly too short and in obvious need of mending. Ma would never let pa out of the house in such a state. The boy has stiff looking leather boots resembling Annies very own footwear.  He has dark blue suspenders and is swinging a pail along as well. He and Annie meet up as they pass old Mr. Johnsons barn.  Old Mr. Johnson yells a lot and his dog barks constantly, but they are both actually really nice.  Neither Annie nor Dougie are afraid of Mr. Johnsons bark, or his dogs for that matter! The boys hair is damp and has the obvious appearance of having been slicked down, but to no avail!  Dougies hair would never submit to a combing, no matter how hard his ma fusses and pulls and smashes at it!
Hey he begins. Annie smiles in return.  Her grin is infectious and Dougies eyes light up with a broad smile spreading across his face.
Dougies teeth are kind of too large for his mouth.  His teeth sort of take over his face when he smiles.  
Hey Annie. 
Thats not Dougies voice Annie thinks.
Oops. Sorry Mrs. Jones, Annie says feeling sheepish. She can tell by the expectant look on Mrs. Joness face that she has been asked a question.  What was it?  
Hmm? Oh dear...think fast. Mmm. Lets see in the hallway.  Quick, quick! Oh why cant I just pay attention?  Why cant I just pay attention?  Why cant I just pay attention? Why cant I just pay attention?  Why cant I just  Annie mutters the familiar chant, as she searches desperately for a reply.
Mrs. Jones face has the most interesting shade to it now.  Its sort of mottled reddish with little while lines around her tightly pursed mouth and interested little white indentations forming between her eyebrows. The red color is creeping down her neck and up to her ears. Annie thinks the coloring is really not very flattering, not very flattering at all!
Well? Mrs. Jones leans in toward Annie even more; her hands are now fisted on her hips.  Hmm...Not good. Annie studies her surroundings quickly.  Lets see, she is thinking, standing in the hallway Mrs. Jones seems irritated Mmm What was I supposed to be doing in the hallway?
Going to the bathroom! Annie blurts loudly, clearly pleased with herself.
Wh-what?!  Mrs. Jones stammers.
What what?? Annie looks expectantly.
This kind of confused, jumbled exchange between the two is definitely not new.  Mrs. Jones again thinks that she will never survive the year.

Andrew Duggan lives in Cheshire and keeps the wolf from the door by working in the computer industry. 'Scars Beneath The Skin' is his second completed novel.

A journey into darkness. A precarious route back to salvation. Love at the point of suicide in a world that's falling apart.","Scars Beneath The Skin

Petrol and teargas saturated the air; everywhere, the sound of police ricocheted from walls that closed in. Batons hammered against shields in a steady drumbeat. Air horns bayed, as though a herd of wild animals was stampeding - the sounds of an abattoir. The glow of fires rose over the bulk of Alexanderplatz. Lucia tried to pull Dresner by the arm, but he was rooted to the spot.

'What's wrong with you? We've got to get out of here. Now.'

'Can't you see? Can't you see he's there?' he shouted. The armoured car inched forward towards the demonstrators, the black wheels rolled past the entrance to the alleyway. Dresner tasted blood in the back of his throat.
The diesel engine gunned again and whistles blew.

'Who's there? There's no-one there, Karl. No-one.'

'He is. Look. We can't leave him. We can't. He needs help.'

'Who needs help? There's nobody here. Just us, Karl. Just us.'

'He's bleeding. He'll die if we leave him.'

A wall had sprung up; she could pass through it, he was trapped on the other side - the side of petrol bombs and bricks, the side of violence. Lucia beat her fists against his chest, and his eyes began to focus. She was all that was in focus, everything else was in a haze. He had become nothing more than a spectator.

'I'm not leaving you here, Karl.'

Sirens wailed louder. At the summit of the Fernsehturm, wreathed in smoke, the glow of flames reflected in the stainless steel panels of a seven-storey glitter-ball; the Telecafe, the observation decks, spinning once every thirty minutes, a plaything for the tourist with enough spare change for the telescopes.

'I'll die rather than leave you.'

He tasted sweat on her lips.

'Do you want me to die because of you? Do you want that? Is that what you want?'

Again, the taste of salt and lipstick washed away the taste of blood, but even on her skin he could smell smoke. A petrol bomb streaked over the roof of the armoured car. In the instant of the explosion Dresner realised. The wall came down. The moment froze, his hand almost clasping her hand.

'Karl!'

In slow motion, flames like liquid in a wave took the shape of a hand that became a claw - reaching out for Lucia.

"41110","","1","That whole climate thing","Draft","true","This post is a leeetle bit politics-y. Not a lot - it's mainly about attitudes to the climate debate - but I'll tuck it away behind the cut just to be on the safe side.","So, this is probably how the world makes up its mind about stuff. You have people on one side freaking out and trying to sound the alarm and everyone else is totally oblivious. It <em>feels</em> as though nothing is happening, but maybe that's exactly how the process of global change works. 

I wasn't surprised when that recent story broke about the UK probably missing its renewable energy targets and how it had 'achieved little so far on renewables'; you can sort of feel that nothing is being done yet. It's something to do with the tone of government announcements and subsequent news reporting. We're not yet hearing the anguish in the voice. Compare the climate changes situation with stories about specifics like, say, the recent flooding. When the waters were rising there were plenty of rather urgent live reports from journalists 'at the scene' and much more in the way of slightly-aggrieved increasingly-impatient editorialising. 

There's so much less of that with climate change and green targets. It's still seen as a chore, it's another box to tick. If it were a domestic emergency, climate change and renewable energy is seen as a dripping tap rather than a tree toppling onto the house. In fact it's not even that, it's rubbish that needs taking out and those who won't shut up about it are seen as nags and maybe a little bit loony. George Monbiot, always at the heart of something controversial, but always - from what I can tell - sounding fairly reasonable about it - is complaining today about all the anti-campaigner stories in the news. Where do they come from? Where's the evidence of behind these accusations? If he's right, it really is a disgrace. Painting peaceful protesters as terrorists is one of the most cynical and abusive things you can do, for all sorts of reasons - and exactly what lefties like me worry about whenever someone says they need 'sweeping new powers to combat terrorism'.

Some time soon I think the tone will shift. And it will happen when people start to get scared. Evidence can always be explained away or ignored - fear can't. In the back of many people's minds - without them fully being aware of it - a list is being compiled. On the list so far are heatwaves, hurricanes and Katrina, record rainfall and flooding, and maybe some pictures on TV of icebergs calving. That list will grow and one day it will dawn on us that it's real and we're in trouble. Really deep trouble. And suddenly protesters won't be 'criminals', they'll be 'the people'. And the government will be back-pedalling and spin-doctoring like crazy. And all it will take is for that mental list to get long enough quickly enough. Which sadly for us all, will probably happen once it's about five years too late to fix the worst of it, because it always takes a while for changes - both good and bad -","","","","2007-08-18","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Politics? Yes. But also TV. Plus it's a brief post.

I think the most important questions I had about Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez were answered in last night's screening of John Pilger's film <em>The War on Democracy</em>. And once it had covered U.S. interference in Venezuela, the film worked its way around a few other notable parts of Latin America. I'd love to recommend that you watch it when it's repeated, because it's important stuff, but it doesn't appear to be on again. So if you didn't stay up until twenty to one last night - or tape it - you're out of luck for the time being. Mind you, I'm amazed and delighted that they showed it in the first place - although they did move it an hour later at the last minute. It's explosive stuff, though the style is often very laid back. So if the controller for ITV happens to be reading this, I wonder if you could delay a few Judge Judy or Sally Jessy Raphael repeats and give the Snowblog readership another chance to see this amazing film on ITV2 or 3? Thanks. Failing that, the DVD is out in October '07 (I think). Anyone who wonders whether the press and the government - particularly in the US - can be trusted to further democracy, the answers will be available in October. (Sneak preview answer: 'No. Uh uh. Definitely not.').","","","","","2007-08-21","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Snowblog reader Maggie B wrote in with a fine question. She wondered how to submit a review of a Snowbooks book to this website. A very fine question indeed, and one that, to my shame, I had never considered. It's the simple ideas that are the best. 

A morning of faffing around in movable type and on various techie forums and I'm not much closer to having a brainwave as to how I can set up such a thing. So I think I'll take the easy route and invite reviews of any of our books to be submitted via email. I'll then put them up on the blog and on the book's own page - if they're good, that is (I don't mean positive; I mean thoughtful, useful and well-written. You can pan the book, but you have to do it intelligently!)

Hooray for Sally Zigmund! Here is her review of THE NEEDLE IN THE BLOOD by Sarah Bower.

------------
 
1066 and all that. Much of what is known about the Norman invasion of England and its aftermath is gleaned from the Bayeux Tapestry, which is, in fact, not a tapestry at all but an embroidery.

But who commissioned it, designed it and why? Who were the women who stitched it? Did they transfer their own thoughts and feelings onto the cloth? Why the references to Aesop's fables? Who are the mysterious priest and the woman called Aelfgytha who appear in an early panel?","Sarah Bower has immersed herself in the scholarship but it never intrudes upon the narrative. At the heart of her novel is a passionate and highly erotic love affair. But this is no sentimental romance because it is firmly anchored in the history. The central protagonists, Norman Odo, brother of the King and the half Welsh-half Saxon Aelfgytha are so real you can touch them. All the people in this book, whether historical or not spring to life on the page. The author is brilliant at evoking all the senses, from the stench of blood on the battlefield, the taste of someone's perfumed skin, the rasp of a needle against the finger.

This is a novel of riches that makes you laugh and cry. I did both. As Aelfgytha and the other embroiderers create a world with their needles, so too the author with her pen. A memorable novel and one to savour. It deserves to win every prize going!

Just pondering the word 'always' and its roots. Glancing at an online dictionary the origin is supposedly:
 <em>Origin: 1200-50; ME alwayes, alleweyes, alles weis, gen. (denoting distribution; cf. once) of all wei; alle- lost its gen. ending and was treated as a compounding element under influence of alle wey.</em> So, ""always"" comes from the germanic for ""all ways"". Which to my mind doesn't reflect its meaning. ""All ways"" should mean something like ""Anyhow""","But look at the French: <em>toujours</em>. Isn't it weird that if you sort of transliterate it into English you get ""all days""? And it's so easy to imagine dropping the 'd' to give ""all'ays"". Which you could easily spell as ""always"", or ""alwayes"". Plus you have a root that seems to mean what it's supposed to mean. If something is true ""all days"", it's true always. And there are heaps of expressions that were sort of transliterated into English over the years, so it wouldn't be a strange route to take. 

Granted, I don't have any citations for my alternative etymology - and I doubt it would stand up to analysis - but you've got to admit, it makes a lot more sense than the version in the dictionaries.

Which leads us to one inescapable conclusion I would say. Sooner or later, I'm going to have to clear another ten feet of shelf space and buy a nice, old leatherbound copy of the OED.","","","","2007-08-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Vaughan is a web producer at the BBC, who is looking to take his writing beyond the 'blog that is not quite a blog' which he writes as An Unreliable Witness.

Animal Fables

A sequence of fairy tales for adults who never quite grew up, and for those strange, solitary children who grow up too soon.","Animal Fables

Once upon a time, there lived a squirrel called Cynthia.
 
Cynthia was the most generous squirrel you could ever wish to meet. Indeed, she was generous to a fault, and in her case it was a very big fault.
 
Like any squirrel, most of her day was spent scurrying around the forest foraging for nuts. She was quite the best forager around, a fact to which every other squirrel would jealously attest. They really didn't need to be quite so jealous, however, because all they needed to do was ask for a nut, and she would hand it over.
 
""Oh, I'm so very hungry. That looks like a wonderfully tasty nut you've got there, Cynthia. Can I have it? Please?""
 
The scene that followed invariably played itself out in exactly the same way, time and time again. Cynthia would glance down at the nut she was clutching between her front paws, the nut she had often spent most of the morning arduously carrying from the far end of the forest back to her drey, and then - with only the briefest hint of sorrow crossing her face, just enough to cause a flicker of guilt in whoever was asking for that prized possession - she would pass it to her fellow squirrel with a beatific smile.
 
Of course, squirrels are always looking for a quick and painless way to build up their secret larder in preparation for meaner months, and so throughout the forest it became an easy, though entirely lazy option to simply flutter one's eyelashes, praise to the treetops the lusciousness of Cynthias latest nutty acquisition, and watch as she surrendered it gladly and without so much as a word of complaint.
 
Cynthia's best friend, however, was puzzled and concerned by such generous behaviour, and told her as much. ""Cynthia,"" she said, ""I'm puzzled and concerned.""
 
""By what?"" asked Cynthia.
 
""By your generous behaviour, of course. Why do you give away all of your nuts? You're a fabulous forager, and you should be keeping them for yourself, or at least selling them to the other squirrels in exchange for seeds or berries or "" Cynthias friend paused and absentmindedly licked her lips "" those crusts of pizza that the humans discard whilst walking through the forest.""
 
Cynthia blinked, wide-eyed, at her friend. She pondered for a moment, then silently walked to the rear of the drey, placed a paw gently on the doorknob of a cupboard and slowly, slowly pulled it open.
 
The tiny drey shook with a low, ominous rumble. Then suddenly a torrent, a cascade, a veritable landslide of nuts came pouring out. Thousands upon thousands of them. More nuts than any squirrel could dream of, even in their wildest fantasies. The clattering sound they made as they fell to the floor was deafening.
 
When the noise finally ceased, Cynthia couldn't be seen anywhere. She had seemingly been engulfed by the nutty avalanche. Eventually, however, there was movement from underneath the debris, and she appeared, popping her head above the surface then clambering on to the piles of nuts that now covered the entire floor.
 
""You see,"" said Cynthia, as she sucked in a breath and regained her composure, ""theres really no sacrifice in being so very generous with the odd nut or two when you're far and away the best at what you do.""
 
The End.

Prospero, this next writer's pseudoynm, writes when the spirit take him and shakes him till his teeth rattle. Prospero is afraid of ghosts and suffers a lot from whiplash. He has submitted Family Fortunes, a piece of flash fiction. 

On an forgotten rock somewhere in an unremembered sea, a tiny community struggles to survive on what the uncaring waves throw up on their shore.","There was no need to call anyone to a Gathering. In a community that survived by using and re-using every scrap of everything until there was no known way of making any further use of it; knowledge was as valuable as seed corn and knowledge of a Gathering spread faster than blight.

Of the one hundred and eighteen islanders all but three were there. Ram Sheepman was near his time and so was Distaff Carder. Her mother would help Distaff deliver the baby. Old age would deliver Ram.

Stoically indifferent to the bitter cold the Islanders stood outside the hut in their family groups eyeing each other with fearful jealousy. Although they relied on one another for their familys skills and although they were bound with bonds of kinship, first blood was the strongest bond of all, and first blood did not extend beyond parents and siblings. 

There were no words of congratulation or sympathy for the Carders or Sheepman. A birth was a burden beyond the loss of the two Gatherers, and a death though one less mouth to feed also meant one less pair of hands to glean. As the thought leapt from mind to mind so heads turned to look at the Carvers. Blade Carver stared at the ground in front of him. As family head he bore the stares, although he knew the starers were thinking of his father. Branch Carver had killed his six year old son with a single furious blow when the child had failed to return with his allotted cache. Although the loss of the childs share had been a tragedy for the family, the loss of a Gatherer in his first season, after surviving the difficult childhood years, was much worse. It was not the death that had appalled the Islanders, but the waste. Five years of food and clothes and caring. A few days later Branch disappeared and with him the confusion and uncertainty that had plagued the island since Stones death. Strangely, the sacrifice had restored the islanders equilibrium.

This time it was the youngest family head who entered the hut first. Before it had been the eldest. The wind carried away most of the sound as the groups held hands and offered family prayers for good fortune in the selection. They all knew one family would leave the Gathering tonight and go to their croft and grieve. They all knew one of the eleven tokens was blank.

Inside the hut, in total darkness, Stem Wheatsower took a token and fumbled for the first of the slots in the frame. He slipped the token in and a moment later Shout Hogcaller announced a Three for the Wheatsowers. 

The eight Wheatsowers outside the hut immediately moved together to the cliffs edge and gazed down at the wreck.

Huddled together they discussed their strategy as the third family to Gather. As each was only allowed to carry what they could hold in their own arms it was essential they work together.

Broken Bonds is a 7000 word short story in which a child survives a train crash and forms a close bond with one of his rescuers.","---------------------------------------------------------------------


'The train crash, what happened?' He didn't seem particularly bothered by the question.
She had been warned he would call, and told him as simply as she could so that he would understand. 'You were badly injured. People came to help:passersby, other passengers. They tore up their shirts to bandage you.
Then the rescue services arrived.'
'So where am I now?'
'What do you see?'
'Nothing really. Its very bright, very white.' he paused. 'Is this heaven? Are you an angel?'
'No, Im just someone who tried to help'
'I remember. You held me very tight. It hurt'.
'Sorry  they didn't want you to fall asleep.' 
There was a slurred, 's'alright'.
She waited for the next question, the obvious question. Maybe not so obvious as it was a long time coming.
'So, what now?' he asked
'I don't know,' she said, 'this is a first for me'
'Me too,' he said, drifting off to sleep.

*

The phone rang.
'Sister Agnes,' she answered, then checked herself. 'I mean, Polly Robinson'
'Who's Sister Agnes?' It was the boy. It had been a while since his initial call, she had wondered if he would phone again.
'Just someone from my past,' she said, avoiding the question.
'I had a 'past' too' he said, quietly, 'and a 'now'.'
'So, what's going on in your 'now'?'
'Just waiting for my jelly' he sounded sleepy. 'Don't you believe in God?'
The question surprised her, 'Why do you ask?'
'Because you're not a Sister anymore, and Sisters only become ordinary people when they don't believe in God any more and want to get married. I saw that on TV.' 
She paused to collect her thoughts, wondering if she should lie. Instead she chose the truth - a difficult habit to break.
'I used to, but after the crash it became very difficult to keep believing'.
'Oh. I still believe in him,' the boy said with an easy air. 'He's got to exist or my parents wouldn't be in Heaven, would they?' 
Polly had to admit he was right, and said 'yup' in agreement, but quickly, in case it stuck. 
'Uncle Otto told me that God took my parents up to Heaven because he has something big on, which he needs a lot of angels for - like stopping a war, or a plague that could kill thousands. ""For every one he takes, it saves a hundred still on earth""' - he was obviously quoting his uncle.
'I dont think there have been any reports of plague recently.' Polly sounded a little more dismissive than she meant to be.
'There's bird flu' said the boy, 'and if God was preventing a war, then it wouldn't have got started and been reported on TV would it?' - she couldn't fault his logic on that - 'and Santa Claus is really Jesus'.
She hurriedly changed the subject. 'Has your jelly arrived yet?'
'No, Nurse Jenny was supposed to be getting it, but she's busy with Jane right now'.
'Who's Jane?'
'The girl in the bed next to mine. They pulled the curtains round a few minutes ago, and lots of doctors and nurses have been going in and out'.
'So, jelly,' said Polly, realizing this was a 'distraction call'- and trying to distract herself from the calls of Clear! that were audible in the background, 'that must mean youre getting better - if you're eating jelly now'.
'I suppose,' said the boy. 'Nurse Jenny mushes it up so I can suck it through a straw'.

Jason writes software for an aerospace company.  He prefers writing fiction, however, because ""there's less burning wreckage to clear up if he gets it wrong."" <em>Pentecost Hotel </em>is his first novel.

Standing at a funeral, Bill finds that, for the life of him, he can't quite remember how he got there.  But he remembers the music...","Pentecost Hotel

We're at a funeral.  We're at a funeral and it's cold, and wet, and the rain stings like gravel and we want to go home - I want to go home.  I desperately need some rest, I've been overdoing it lately.  But it looks like it's far from over, and so we shuffle our feet uncomfortably as a distant voice laments the fragility of the human machine, and we stare at the gilded box as the rain pools in blobs and runs down the handles.

Ashes to ashes, mud to mud.

I notice a few sly looks in my direction and I reach for Charlotte's hand, but it's out of reach.  I twist my neck against the stiff shirt collar and feel my head swell up as the blood supply is stemmed, but I can't see her under the phalanx of black umbrellas.  I wish I hadn't made her come.  She's never liked funerals, and now she'll be on her own, surrounded by sobbing strangers.  My fault.  I realise, before I straighten my neck and equalise the pressure, that I don't even know the people standing next to me.  The eulogy drones on, barely audible against the drumming of the rain, so I swap my weight from one leg to the other in the squishy mud, and wonder, briefly, if I'm slowly sinking.  Perhaps I'll be six feet under before the deceased, ho, ho.

God, I wish I was somewhere else.

And then I have a moment of... what's the opposite of a moment of clarity?  A moment of opacity?  Of confusion?  The scene is frozen, like the closing shot of a cheap soap opera, and I feel as though ethereal but slightly sinister music should be playing as the cameral pans out skywards, leaving us as tiny black dots on a green background to symbolise the futility of it all.  I realise that I have no idea why I'm here.  I know I'm at a funeral because I'm wearing a tie, and I know that I'm grieving deeply for a dearly beloved friend because I feel a powerful but mysterious guilt.  But I can't for the life of me remember who the hell it is.  How did it come to this?  Where did it start?  I remember that, at least.

It started at the Pentecost Hotel.


                                 ***


The Pentecost Hotel steered its own course through time, indestructible and irreparable, towards a future foretold.  It had survived the aerial bombers and municipal planners that had devastated half the city, yet fresh paint peeled unwanted from its roof, repointing was depointed, and its blocky brow refused to hide the name carved deep in the sandy stone.

In the end, all attempts to reverse or accelerate its stately decay were abandoned and, although its halcyon days had seen the gentry of Georgian society gavotte through its gilded rooms, its clientele had slowly degenerated alongside it, until now, solemn and secretive, it attracted entirely the wrong sort of person.  Which is why, on a warm April morning, I shouldered my way through the battered doors and into its faded embrace.  I'm home...

Adam C Britten teaches Religious Education at a secondary school in Bradford. In ""Tiberius Steele and the Golden Leopard"", Tiberius Steele, the multi-millionaire adventurer, travels into the heart of Africa to save a beautiful woman and restore the fortunes of an oppressed people.

What a name! Tiberius Steel! Love it. And a corking opening line to boot.","Tiberius Steele and the Golden Leopard
 
""It is a pity I will not see you die, Mr Steele.  But time is not on my side.  This little trinket,"" Reichmann held the emerald up to his good eye before putting it into his jacket pocket, ""must be in Bangkok tomorrow.  And I intend to deliver it myself.  I hope you will forgive my bad manners.  I realise etiquette is something you English take seriously, but I have no choice.  Even my own jet cannot be kept waiting.  Airports are busy places these days and the Liberian authorities cannot be bought off indefinitely.""
 
Steele struggled against his ropes.  The knots bit into his wrists and reminded him that they had been tied by someone who knew what they were doing.  Reichmann didn't employ amateurs.  His band of thugs could teach degree courses in violence.
 
 ""Make sure you look after the Shark's Tooth carefully,"" Steele said.  ""I'll expect it to be in pristine condition when I take it back.""
 
 Reichmann laughed with his familiar asthmatic wheeze.  His breath rattled in his broad chest and sent shock waves through his muscular physique.  Not even the immaculate cut of his black suit could hide the remarkable definition of his pectorals and biceps as they twitched and strained with each guffaw.  It seemed Reichmann, even with all his millions, couldn't afford a good tailor.
 
 ""If the prospect of your imminent death did not amuse me so much, I might have found your unbounded optimism just a little annoying.  As it is...""
 
 Reichmann pointed to the large, red valve set in the metal wall behind him.  The guard who stood near the watertight door shouldered his machine gun and began to turn the wheel.  It moved with ease.  All Steele heard as the valve rotated was Reichmann's chuckle and the low rumble of water.  The cavernous pipe opposite him began to vibrate.  It rattled and shuddered as the rivets took the strain.
 
 ""If you're lucky,"" Reichmann continued, ""the water pressure will knock you out before you drown.  That would be a pity, but as I have already explained, I cannot stay to enjoy your death.  How you die is not as important to me as the fact that you will die.""  He stood directly above the pipe on the narrow ledge which skirted the ship's hold.  ""And believe me, this is the last time our paths will cross.""  Reichmann touched the patch over his left eye.  ""You have involved yourself in my business affairs once too often.""
 
 Steele made one more attempt to break free of the rope which secured his hands to the chain above his head.  It's heavy links hardly moved.  High up in the roof of the hold, lost in the gloom, the grey metal remained motionless, like a giant pendulum waiting to mark out the last seconds of his life.
 
 ""Just tell me one thing,"" Steele said.  ""Who betrayed me?""

Dominic Pike started writing when he was a small fish, and has an MSc in Creative Writing from Edinburgh University. He is working on short stories and two novels.

In Her Wake

Fresh from burying his wife Juliette, Oscar is forced to confront his own craven inadequacies during a visit from her lover, Chris.","In Her Wake

''He is not having sex with a dead woman,' the gendarme protests, coming back from the bushes, shaking a bony finger at the frightened mother and child. 'Non, non, non, non, non! She is not dead. . . she is En-glish!''
Juliette's punch-line had plunged half the guests round the table into porcine snorts of laughter, while the other half - the women - had sat smiling politely, nervously fiddling with the ill-fitting and unbecoming lines of last year's tops and blouses. Primary colours clashed angrily with their blushes. Other than him, only Juliette had sensed the collective discomfort at their own arid sex lives: the joke awakened the usually unspoken fears of how frigidness can beget the irreversible waning of marital desire.
            And that was how Oscar chose to remember his dead wife on the day he buried her; that she could have every man eating nothing out of the palms of her hands and still not disappoint them, beguiled, wanting more.
            Outside, the light was fading fast. He prowled the sitting room, drawing curtains and lighting lamps against the gloaming. After prodding the fire, he threw on another gnarled log and fetched two tumblers and a bottle from the corner cabinet. He poured himself a generous glass. Traffic slushed through the street outside. It made the bursting light and warmth of the fire more intrusively comforting as he twisted the neck of the whisky bottle. He always found it peculiarly cathartic to break the integrity of the new seal around a stopper, the noisy scrunch an introductory nod to long evenings of well trodden conversation and the honeyed expectation of what lay ahead. He toyed with it for a moment, lingering, before crumpling it decisively and consigning it to the fire. 
            In the aftermath of other deaths, a cast of friends and hangers-on had gathered to exchange cliches, publicly indulging the widow or widower or partner with handy off-the-shelf mantras - Oh, you know, everyone deals with grief in their own way - while raising a private eyebrow at whatever out-of-character behaviour they were supposed to be indulging. How the cliche-mongers reconciled those two positions with such ease never failed to rattle his faith in human nature.
Now, standing here on a wet Friday afternoon, applying the mantra to himself was at once liberating and oppressive: he could drink whisky at a time of day he'd usually be brewing a pot of tea and nobody would bat an eyelid, publicly at least. But the freedom to do whatever he wanted led him to scrutinise every one of his actions for signs of normal behaviour or otherwise, and it seemed to follow him around the house like a chronically indecisive old relative. Left unchecked, he thought, it threatened to induce complete paralysis. After all, it wasn't so unusual to be preparing the house for the arrival of a guest, even if that guest was his wife's lover. It was simply his way.

Maggie, whose excellent idea it was in the first place to have reader reviews on this website, has sent in a lovely review of The Other Eden. She says it was one of the best books she's read - how marvellous!","""I was very kindly sent this book for 'free' by Snowbooks, and as soon as it came through the post, I began reading it. I loved the cover of this book and knew I was in for a treat.

It's the first time I have read a novel like this. I am a big fan of Historical fiction, but I have never read a novel that contained information on Classical music. I'm not really even a fan of Classical music and yet, I found myself completely taken in with this book.

The author described the surroundings with a lot of detail and I was quickly taken in by the story, I felt as though I was there with them, and I was living Eleanor's life with her, going through each trial in trying to solve her Mothers past. In the chapters when Alexander and Eleanor played the Piano together and also at other times on their own, I was taken in by this and I was able to visualise the effect the music had on them, it seemed to reach out to me. This was one of my most favourite parts of the book. I'm now considering listening to some Classical music. See what this novel has done to me! ;)

I could go on to describe lots more about this book, both Eve and Elizabeth play an important part in this novel, but to go on would only give the plot away and possibly ruin it for others.

For me this book was a beautiful love story that I didn't want to end, but it was also sad, there wasn't a boring moment in it. If you like novels that contain history, hauntings, suspense and romance, then this book is for you.

This is one of the best books I have read this year. I will definitely be reading more by this author.""

Reading linguistics books is fun. Fun, I tell you. They're sort of the opposite of <em>Eats, Shoots and Leaves</em>. They assume that speakers of a language know what they're doing and they study them to learn the rules they're using. Lynne Truss and others (even the otherwise marvellous John Humphreys) assume that the rules come first and anyone not following them is 'speaking badly'. Now, naturally, I like the idea of a standard version of English for use in books and the like, but anyone who views changes to spoken language as a bad thing should really have the courage of their convictions and speak only Old English or maybe Sanskrit.","As well as quietly undermining the Dialect Police, linguistic books also contain bizarre/fascinating language facts. For instance, nouns and verbs are 'open classes' of words. 'blog' is a new noun and 'to fax' is a new verb, relatively speaking. With open classes you expect additions. Prepositions are a 'closed class'. We don't add new ones just because we've invented a new activity or contraption. In most languages, adjectives are an open class. I am lead to believe, by the book I'm reading at the moment, that in Igbo (a Nigerian language) adjectives are a closed class. Here's the list, in pairs:
<ul><li>large - small</li>
<li>new - old</li>
<li>good - bad</li>
<li>light/white - dark/black</li></ul>

And supposedly that's your lot. No other adjectives. Apparently, Igbo speakers also had to borrow the English word for 'blue' not having one of their own. Honestly, if it wasn't an official-looking book (see above), written by someone whose first name is 'Professor', I'd think I was being fibbed to.

BTW, to anyone interested in learning the basics of syntax (or, you know, language) it's a book I'd really recommend. It's called <em>Understanding Syntax</em> by <a href=""http://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/research/language/profile/maggie.tallerman"">Prof. Maggie Tallerman</a>. For a technical book it's very readable (though admittedly not quite as readable as a non-technical one). <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Understanding-Syntax-Language-Maggie-Tallerman/dp/0340810327/ref=sr_1_1/026-4755288-6551642?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1188378103&sr=8-1"">Amazon link</a>.","","","","2007-08-29","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

The submissions for <em>Richard and Judy's Best Read 2008</em> have to be in in a couple of weeks. They invite publishers to include some marketing information about the titles we submit. What I'd <em>really</em> like is to include endorsements from SnowBlog readers saying how much they enjoyed the books I'm submitting.","I'm allowed to submit six titles, published in 2007. It would be marvellous if you could write between 50 and 100 words or so (doesn't really matter) on any of our eligible books. If you could say why you think they should be selected by Richard and Judy - why their viewers would enjoy them - that would be ideal. They are: 
<ul>
<li style=""margin-top: 0px;"">Needle in the Blood</li>
<li style=""margin-top: 0px;"">Taking the Plunge</li>

Since we can only enter six, not all these books will be submitted, but I'd really like to hear your views and thoughts on them. If we got a book onto Richard and Judy it would utterly transform the business and the author's career, so saying that I would appreciate your help doesn't come close to how grateful I'd be.

"41133","","1","Snowcase #29","Future","true","Larry Harrison is sitting in East Yorkshire, dreaming of the next one hundred years. 

In his <em>Glimpses of a Floating World</em>, the escape of a teenage heroin addict in 1960s London brings about a chain of events that ends in murder and mayhem.

This Snowcase features bad language and, frankly, rather horrific scenes so look away now if you'd rather not read it. That means you, Mum.","Glimpses of a Floating World
 
They ran Ronnie backwards along the dark corridor, a screw holding each arm, and reversed him into the padded cell. That way he couldn't wedge his feet against the doorjamb, or put up any meaningful resistance.
 
They made him wear a grey woollen dressing gown, but had taken away the cord, so that he wouldn't be able to hang himself. The gown fell open as they rushed him along, and he looked down at his own emaciated body. Each rib could be seen, as clearly as a chicken's when you ripped the meat off the bone. His long blond hair hung down in rats' tails. His cock and balls looked small, shrunken in the cold. Embarrassed, he wanted to cover himself up, but couldn't, and he realised how defenceless he was. That was the first thing the screws had told him: 'You're in prison now, lad, and we can do anything we like to you!'
 
Ronnie was pinned face down on the padded floor, one screw kneeling on his back. His breath came in ragged gasps as he shouted at them to get off. Then, changing tack, he tried pleading with them.
 
'I just need my fix! Please!'
 
This seemed to provoke the man restraining him. The knee pressed harder into his back. He felt the warmth of the man's breath, first on the nape his neck, and then in his ear.
 
'We'll give you an injection, lad: a ruddy meat injection!'
 
'Right up your fucking arse,' added the second screw.
 
A third screw, who wore a white jacket, entered the cell, carrying a syringe in one of those kidney-shaped bowls, the kind made of white enamel, with a blue line painted around the rim.
 
'400 milligrams of Largactil,' White Jacket announced, 'equals one quiet night, for Yours Truly.' He said it with satisfaction, as though he'd just won an argument.
 
Ronnie fought to throw off his persecutors.
 
'He's getting his dander up now!' laughed the first screw.
 
'Oh dearie, dearie me!' said White Jacket. 'Should I be worried?'
 
Ronnie smelt an alcohol swab, and felt a large needle stab into his buttocks, the muscle slowly forced apart by the injection. Above him in the ceiling was a red light, behind a steel mesh. It would stay on night and day, so that he would soon lose all sense of time. It was 4 p.m. on the sixth of June, 1963.
 
His jailors paused to look at him as they departed, swinging the heavy padded door closed. Ronnie heard the jangle of a key turning in the lock. He'd not had a fix for over fourteen hours. His feet felt as if they were immersed in icy water, and the chill was seeping up his legs, poised to invade the core of his body. His strength was ebbing away. Every limb felt flimsy, too weak to support his weight. He forced himself to stand. It was hard to walk on the padded floor; it bounced like a mattress and pitched him sideways, so that he swayed around like a gale-struck sapling, and lurched from one wall to another.

Like everyone else I've ever asked about this, I find the idea of hidden underground vaults, lost waterways, forgotten tunnels and concealed subterranean chambers fascinating. For instance, the Deep Level Shelters under London, each protecting 8000 people during the height of the Blitz, are still down there hidden 150 feet beneath familiar streets. I've passed their unimposing doors hundreds of times not recognising them for what they are. Similarly, the idea that the Fleet River courses beneath the foundations of the street that takes its name, but hasn't seen the light for two hundred years is strangely compelling. I wrote a little sliver of a <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Homelight.pdf"">short story</a> a while back for <a href=""http://www.litro.co.uk/"">Litro</a> trying to capture something of that feeling.

I have had a query from one of our authors on all this office moving malarky, so here is a clarificatory note. 

The Snowbooks office remains at 120 Pentonville Road where we enjoy the friendship and neighbourliness of our landlords <a href=""http://www.kogan-page.co.uk/"">Kogan Page</a>. I will work from there Thursday and Friday every week, at least. I will work from home (in the country) Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday most weeks. However, it will vary a lot, as in the exciting world of publishing no two weeks are the same. For the purposes of post, telephones and meetings, nothing has changed, and our London office is our main home. 

Hope that's clear.","","","","","2007-08-30","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Sharon Richardson sends in a tale of how four friends meet and the life they lead, stepping out into the big bad world, thinking they're on their own. Girls on Tour is her first novel based on her life with her friends and everything good and bad in between.","Girls on Tour

Prologue - I will survive..
January 1st 2005

All is quiet on New Year's Day, with the exception of the 'boom boom boom' in my head following last night's celebrations. I could have sworn the party finished hours ago, albeit only a few, but my deluded throbbing head seems to want to remain with the hardcore elite of party people. Now if only the rest of my body could believe that I'd solve life's mystery of how to be eighteen again. I also need the room to stop spinning around; I'd like to bet Kylie's never been inspired to sing that song under these same circumstances either. The only solace I took from the excruciating pain I felt as I lifted my head three inches from the pillow like an Olympic weightlifter that's going for the new world record was that it was a great night, another successful chapter in the history of 'girls on tour'. 

The fab four; Sabrina, Chloe, Grace and me, Meg had made a unanimous decision to see this particular year out with a big bang, huge, to honour our first full year being single again. In addition to the usual plan, drink, be merry, drink some more, we agreed to make this a special night, our night. 

The preparation for the big night out of course took longer than the night out itself which for this being my first year as a novice to the group was educational to say the least. According to Sabrina, 'its great fun and all part of the build up to the big night. Meg you're gonna love it but if you're gonna do it you have to do it properly'. 

Filled with the enthusiasm of a little child about to ride their first bike I bought into all the hype that started with a full day's shopping to make the purchase of 'the outfit'. Which by the way you then need to get new heels on the shoes you've worn that day because you've walked a marathon but at least it includes lunch. Next, the shoes to go with 'the outfit' which if you're lucky or wise as I've since learnt you encourage others to buy at the same time as the outfit, preferably in the same shop. If you're not so lucky, or the shoes you need to match the outfit haven't been made yet, a fate best saved for Grace on more than one occasion then this becomes another day's shopping and about as much fun as having your teeth pulled. By the second day you need a good foot massage only there's no time for such luxuries its shop, shop, shop. It doesn't include lunch either, because there's only three days left before the big night and panic starts to set in. 

For a so called day off I was just thinking that all this was far too much stress and pressure to handle. Even more so when I started to receive a sulk on the face of Cinderella, also known on this particular trip as Grace.

While looking at pictures from the underworld, I came across this one. Anyone want to guess what it is? This may help or it may not (depending on what you know about me) but my grandfather used to tell me stories about them when I was a little kid - at my request. He worked underground and came into contact with them from time to time. They're ludicrously dangerous, but up until now I'd never seen one. I hadn't realised how pretty they were.","<hr/><br/>

Do you know the expression 'mad as a hatter'? Hatters used to dip hats in mercury and the vapour from the mercury would send some of them insane. You don't want mercury vapour around, particularly not underground in a confined space. Neither do you want hard ultraviolet, which is what that purple glow is. 

In the days before transistors and the like, London Underground used the technology of the day to provide the electricity for their trains. Pour a few pints of mercury into a thin glass balloon, pump out some air, connect a gazillion volts of AC electricity from the grid and strike an arc. Out the other side comes <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_arc_rectifier"">DC electricity</a> that tube trains can run on, and in the meantime you have a handy supply of both poison gas and dangerous radiation. And according to my granddad (who was an engineer on the Underground) sometimes they'd shatter, releasing clouds of mercury vapour and a torrent of liquid metal that presumably still had a few thousand volts connected to it. I ask you, who wouldn't want to be an engineer?

And while I'm reminiscing, I also remember my granddad explaining to me the pitfalls of working with voltages above ten thousand volts. It had, he said, a tendency to 'come out and meet you'. He always offered to read my brother and I bedtime stories from books and I'd always want to hear about all the machines in the substations, the noises they'd make (which he was excellent at mimicking) and what happened when one of them blew up. And the time when even at full output one of the trains wouldn't start, so they sent a man down there who reported that the tunnel was flooded and the water between the tracks was now boiling thanks to the power they were applying down there. Or what happened to mice who ran along the live busbars once their tails got long enough to touch the ground (complete with appropriate sound effects). Or the cat they kept at Mansion House station which was the size of a small dog and the only creature capable of fighting the giant rats down there. Rupert Bear stories never really stood a chance.

<em>Child:</em> I wish I was a teacher
<em>Teacher:</em> That's not correct English. You should say 'were' not 'was'.
<em>Child:</em> Why?
<em>Teacher:</em> That's the rule in Standard English. And using Standard English helps us all understand one another more easily.
<em>Child:</em> But everyone says it the way I just did.
<em>Teacher:</em> Not everyone. Some people still use the correct form. The point is that it's easier to communicate if we all follow the rules.
<em>Child:</em> So what's the rule I should be following?
<em>Teacher:</em> Well, in English the subjunctive isn't grammaticalised so you don't inflect the verb to agree with the subject the same way that you do with the indicative mood. Instead we use modal auxiliaries coupled with fixed inflections of the main verb. In the past tense, the non-past plural form is used, whereas in the present the verb is not inflected at all.
<em>Child:</em> Where did you learn that rule?
<em>Teacher:</em> In college.
<em>Child:</em> So only ten more years and I can talk like you just did and then everyone will understand me? I'm not sure I wish I <em>were</em> a teacher anymore.","<hr/><br/>

Thanks to Mark below for contributing such an appealing reminiscence. And without wishing to be too ageist, I'm rather impressed that someone educated in the 30s is commenting on new-fangled Internet-blogs in the, um, well, whatever we end up calling this decade*. I would only quibble with your old English teacher on one point and that is his dislike of 'finish up'. I have some sympathy with the American practice of adding that particular preposition. 'Finish' can seem a bit naked if it doesn't have an object and giving it a preposition to work with does feel a bit more satisfying. 'What did you finish?' 'I finished <em>up</em>'. That sort of appeals to me.

And as for Katherine's comment: now I can't add in the missing period without either deleting your comment or making you seem deluded, neither of which seem very polite, so I'll have to leave my omissions on public display.

After careful strategic consideration (meaning I just thought of it in the cab on the way home) I am proud to announce a competition that the Snowblog will be hosting for the best - and worst - cover designs in publishing today. 

It is a truth universally acknowledged by right-thinking people that you *can* sell a book by its cover. This means that cover design is important. I see some covers that gladden my heart - they make me pick the book up, they clearly indicate what sort of a book it is but mainly they just work: simultaneously beautiful and functional. 

Others, however, fail. They send confusing signals about the book. They are ugly, formulaic, or jarring to the eye. They act as a barrier to sales - if you buy the book, it's despite the cover. 

So: nominations first! Submit your nominations for the best and worst covers you've seen of late as a comment to this post, with a line describing why you like/dislike them. We'll collate them, and post the images up here, then have a vote.  

Head off to your local <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk"">Book Depository </a>to get some inspiration!","My first nominations? 

The current <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rebecca-Virago-modern-classics-Maurier/dp/1844080382/ref=sr_1_11/026-5305192-4674057?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189146362&sr=1-11"">Daphne Du Maurier</a> collection receives my 'worst' nomination. To clad books of such rounded variety and passion with such thoughtless, bland covers baffles me. 
<a href=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/rebecca.jpg""><img alt=""rebecca.jpg"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/rebecca-thumb.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""318"" /></a>

My favourite cover of recent times is <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cloud-Atlas-David-Mitchell/dp/0340822783/ref=sr_1_1/026-5305192-4674057?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189146567&sr=1-1"">Cloud Atlas</a>. At once adventurous and conforming (it screams 'commercial literary fiction') it made me buy the book. I also liked the way the hardback morphed into the paperback - subtle changes but enough to make the book more accessible.

When you want to buy a screwdriver, it's pretty easy to get one that will do the job (-> to tighten/untighten screws). They're standardised. But when you want to buy some fancy new slacks, it's only semi-easy to do. The sizes are standardised, but finding the right size is only half the job (-> to clothe you in style). When you want to buy a CD or a novel, it's not easy at all. Yes, they're standardised so you can be sure the CD will play in your stereo or that the novel is in the correct language, but will you <em>like</em> it? The surest way to find out is to buy it and read/listen to it. And risk wasting your money. If only someone would come up with a better way.","Popularity works to a point. If a squillion people like something, maybe you will too. But then again, if that was all there was to it, entertainment would be standardised like screwdrivers.

The next-step idea I've been talking to people about since the mid-Nineties is this: you get a hundred thousand people and ask them what their favourite twenty albums/novels are. Then you look for clumps in that data: people with eighteen or nineteen choices in common. Then you use the variations within a clump to make recommendations. If you and I have nineteen albums in common but you've never heard of my third favourite band, there's a good chance that you'll love them.

There are lots of alterations and tweaks you can make to that idea. Rating all your albums will provide better data than just covering the top twenty; mention the ones you hate too. Perhaps you'll need a bigger sample size. Maybe you'd have to try a few methods of making predictions to find one that worked.

But think of what you might discover. Maybe there'd be crossover between album and novel choices - and perhaps movies too. Maybe instead of infinite variety we'd find that, musically speaking, there are only forty-one types of humans. Or maybe no two people are identical in their tastes - but you can bet we'll find plenty of people who are very, very similar. Sooner or later someone has to make this work and I'm pretty convinced that, with a few trials and experiments, it's viable. There seem to be two main problems.

First, if it does work in, say, the music industry it will threaten most of the intermediate/middleman roles in that sector - and that very much includes all the people who are in charge right now. Most bands can learn to record their own MP3s. Most music fans can download them to their pseudoPods. All you need in the middle is a big website that collates preferences and makes good suggestions, plus a big music library/shop. Without all those middlemen, it becomes economically viable to charge one or two pounds for an album instead of ten or fifteen. That means music lovers get a lot more music for the same outlay. And hopefully they rate it and keep the process going. Music lovers do better, all but the biggest bands do better, and only a few suits lose out. But the suits are the ones with the capital and the lawyers and the friends in government. So that's problem one.

Problem two is that Amazon have a system that tries to do something like this already. Every time I mention this idea to people, that's what they tell me. But Amazon's system doesn't ever seem to work. Not for me, at any rate, or for anyone I've talked to. Every now and then I rate a bunch of books and albums on Amazon and let it update its recommendations accordingly. And I believe I've grumbled about the results before. Amazon's system delights in saying 'Hey, if you quite liked this book in paperback, we bet you'll love it in hardback. Or with a different cover. Or better still, have you thought of buying other books from the authors you already know you like?' Amazon's 'system' almost never makes a helpful recommendation. Most of us have already worked the brilliant notion of buying other books from our favourite authors. But what about authors we've never heard of? What about all those things we don't yet know we want? Well, twice now Amazon has recommended non-obvious albums and I've bought them. I didn't like them, but hey, at least they were imaginative suggestions. I had another look just now and of their 15 recommendations there are only two suggestions that go beyond just 'more by this author/band'. I'm almost tempted to waste some money on them. Though I won't be getting my hopes up.

Which brings me to a final point. Imagine what the system I've described would be like if it actually worked. With the Amazon version I'm fairly sure I'm throwing my money away. But what if they started getting it right? What if they began to inspire confidence? What if spending money on their recommended titles actually had a track record of producing treats instead of flops? Well, I think it's pretty clear what would happen. I'd start spending a lot more money with them. Or whoever else cracks this problem. So come on you garden-shed entrepreneurs, asssemble your database gurus and your stochastics experts and your bayesian-inference wizards and your hundred million in venture capital and make that most exciting of gadgets: a jukebox that plays my favourite song from a band I've never heard of.","","","","2007-09-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

Garan is from Pontypridd in South Wales. He spent ten years teaching English in Europe and South America and now lives in Cambridge. He is a freelance writer. <em>Reglers</em> is his novel and he says 'For best reading results, imagine a strong valleys of South Wales accent.' 

Dai wants an independent Wales, Owain wants his old life back.","The reely big news in my life is thah up until yesterday mornin I sold used books for a livin in The Dying of the Light Book Emporium at number 18 Penderyn Street. Came as a bih uv a shook ih did to geh the boot, I cun tell ew. Seems my good long years of service counted for nothin in the end see. Now, admittedly I'd gone in smellin foul of the night before an lookin like somein the cat ad asked the dog to elp er drag in. Buh thah was still no reason for Gab to jest snap like thah was ih? I mean, there's a certain way of doin these things. The decorum of dismissal. I should know like. Been sacked from a fair few jobs in my time I av. Buh people uv always gone about ih nicely see. Ih elps yew mind less yew know. 

   There I am though, only jest through the front door, fightin off a yawn an eyes bloodshot. Say mornin to Old Mrs Mason I do. She's in the corner as usual, lookin up the dirty bits in DH Lawrence an gigglin into er pearls. Then, quick sudden, Gab emerges from a dust cloud screamin the bluest of murders at me an my feet are sweatin somein rotten in my daps. For too long she says I been abusin er good nature. I doan care about anyone or anythin she says an ow cun she av ever trusted me to work in er shop the state I'm in? I dunno mun, the lies people tell. I find many of the people in my life exist almost pewerly within the realms of fansty. So I jest went c'mon mun Gab this is no way to start the week now is ih? Leh's jest press play on the kettle an I'll puh the Pratchetts into chronological an all will be well. Thah's when the darkness came upon er. Thought she was gonnuh it me I did. Honest now. Tampin she was. So I old my ands up in the traditional gesture of conciliation an pacification. Move back a step. Av to puh some distance between me an thah evil lookin clasp on er ambag like. 

   Thah was when she leh out the longest sigh an said she'd give me a month's pay to geh out. Right there an then. Ad no bloody option mun. Mean look she ad on er. Like I was some cheatin low life she was kickin out the door after years of anguish. At last er eyes said, at last. So I thought better of sayin ow I'd been suffrin profound an ungovernable torments of late, turned right on my eel an walked out. On eleven years of salesmanship mind! Out through the door I went, without so much as a keep in touch with Christmas cards or a watch ow yew go now!   But then, thinkin about ih, I was only ever on ourlee pay at the Dying of the Light. So I spawse I should consider ih somein of a result to geh a golden andshake.

Trick heading, of course. I'm always publishing. It's the nature of having your own business - there's no real down time. Even when you're relaxing, it's so that you can be more productive at work. 

Still, there are times in the day when I am not at my desk, and I am not actively doing things to do directly with Snowbooks, and at those times I am doing other things. You know some of them: martial arts (although there haven't been many arm-bars, eye-gouges or reverse spinning back kicks since moving to the country) (there were never many reverse spinning back kicks anyway); taking photos of bunnies (which, conversely, has really ramped up in recent weeks); the obvious activity of reading (Jasper Fforde at the moment; something about trees, too, and a book Rob lent me on book design. Oops, that's publishing). 

I have also been doing a bit of Open University work. This year it has been DD100, an introduction to the social sciences, because I thought it would be nice to know enough about politics, philosophy and economics to get a degree in them, and this was the starter course. I've done quite well in the essays I've done - well enough, in fact, to have skipped the last two and still get a pass mark. And although I've proven to myself quite adequately that there is no physical way on earth that I have the time to study *and* work, I've just enrolled on another course. You might speculate that that course would be something about economics, maybe, or philosophy, given my stated aims. You'd be quite wrong. I've enrolled in M255: <a href=""http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01M255"">Object-oriented programming with Java</a>.","From the syllabus: 

<em>You will learn 
- the fundamental concepts associated with object-oriented programming (object, class, protocol, hierarchy, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, collaboration, etc.)

- to apply and extend your knowledge of programming concepts within an object-oriented programming context.

In Block 1 you will interact with a micro world of graphical objects to explore basic object-oriented ideas. However, soon you will be getting to grips with Java code and syntax and will begin writing your own simple object-oriented code using the BlueJ IDE. Basic object-oriented concepts such as attribute, state, protocol, class and subclass are introduced, initially through interaction with the micro world, and then in the context of writing Java code. Encapsulation is discussed as a core object-oriented principle. By the end of the block, you will be expected to write short methods (the smallest units of code in Java) to specification.

Block 2 continues the teaching about fundamental object-oriented ideas, by investigating inheritance hierarchies, overriding methods, abstract classes, interfaces, polymorphism, re-use of code, static methods and variables. Along the way, you'll learn about creating your own classes, about the facilities of Java for selection and iteration, and more about some of the core, provided Java classes. Different kinds of errors are discussed, along with debugging in the BlueJ environment. After discussion of the need to design code, you will be expected to be able to implement to specification a class along with its methods.

Block 3 introduces a subset of the Java collection classes, and related issues such as iteration. You are guided to apply your knowledge from Blocks 1 and 2, along with the new classes being introduced, to increasingly complex programming exercises. The skill of appropriately utilising a provided library of classes (searching for a useful class and method, for example) is explicitly developed in this context, and re-use by composition is discussed. Reading and writing of files and the use of streams are introduced.

Block 4 starts by discussing testing in an object-oriented context. Then the concept of collaboration, first introduced in Blocks 1 and 2, is revisited and expanded to more complex scenarios. A case study of an implemented system is investigated, in particular looking at the collaborations involved and how they are achieved. Finally, you will learn how to attach a graphical user interface (GUI) (which we will provide) to a business model, and about the mechanisms for keeping the GUI and the model in step.</em>

Bonkers? Sort of but quite cool, too. I already tinker with html and css and bravely try to debug scripts in Access. I patch together XML with XSLT, and have read a few books on VBA and written a few macros, usually by nicking someone else's code. And in doing all this I have decided that progamming isn't hard: it simply requires a phenomenal degree of immersion and practice. I don't know if I'll be able to pull it off, but I'm always up for a challenge! 

I'm posting about this on my publishing company blog because of something I read on <a href=""http://thebookseller.com/blogs/44805-publishers-are-being-out-googled.html"">The Bookseller website</a> today by my friend <a href=""http://thebookseller.com/blogs/44805-publishers-are-being-out-googled.html"">Eoin Purcell. </a> He said: 

""Sometimes I think tech people understand books better than book people. How else can you explain the fact that Google, LibraryThing and Amazon have had greater success at building online tools for books than publishers? It's not about e-books or online content so much as it's about offering simple tools and services for listing books and collecting information about them.""

I agree with him. I absolutely agree. And by learning, in detail, exactly how to make computers do what I want, in increasingly cool ways, I hope that Snowbooks will not be one of the publishers that becomes extinct when someone from outside the book trade glances in our direction and thinks 'ooh! opportunity. I'll 'ave some of that.' It is happening more and more, and I don't want to be left behind. 

So by next June I hope to be able to write little applications. Won't that be cool! See, learning can be enjoyable *and* useful. And it keeps me out of fights.","","","","2007-09-10","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

I've got a couple of weird rules for watching the news. I suppose having any rules at all for watching the news is a bit weird. Or maybe very weird? But the thing is, you need them. Otherwise you're not really taking it in; you're watching cartoons. Or so it seems to me.","My first rule is to avoid human interest stories. I'd call a human interest story anything where the same kind of thing happens over and over and doesn't change anything (except for the few people involved). A murder, a kidnapping, a celebrity who's... well, a celebrity who's done almost anything actually. With those stories once you've finished learning all about them you're still no better informed. They fade away and another one happens and you still don't understand the world any better. You just end up with the vague sense that the world is filling up with crime and bad luck (when it's really just filling up with stories about them). That's my view anyway. And they also seem so arbitrary. Like the rule that missing children of ordinary parents only make the news if they're white-skinned and blonde and pretty. That's a horrible rule, but to the best of my knowledge it's a law of Western journalism.

The second rule is to use the news to test theories as much as you can. The kinds of theories I'm talking about go after important parts of the story that aren't being mentioned, like: what are the agendas of those involved? what's behind the timing of it? and why is this even in the papers? Taken to extremes, those questions can turn you into a paranoid conspiracy freak. But if you don't ask them enough, you end up just being spoon fed. You become the sort of citizen that wicked politicians rub their hands over. The other reason this rule is important is that it makes reading news interesting. If there's no sense of putting the pieces together, then what's news for? It's just time that could be spent watching celebrities.

Which brings me to today's news. I saw a Google News webpage that suggested there were over a thousand newspaper stories worldwide criticising Britney's performance at the MTV VMAs. But could it <em>really</em> have been as bad as they say? Are they just being mean? Are they just trying to keep an audience happy who (to use a phrase from a William Gibson novel) 'crave the warm god-flesh of the anointed' from time to time? Whatever, I'm tempted to watch the performance on YewChoob and see for myself.

I don't know if the death of Anita Roddick is in danger of coming under the definition from my last post of being merely a 'human interest' story. Even if her passing doesn't meet my strict definition of 'proper news', her life certainly did. It's 32 years after the passage of the Sex Discrimination Act in the UK and still board directors of big companies are virtually all men. Either women aren't up to the job or the men aren't inviting the women to join them on the board. You can make up your own mind on that, but 32 years is a long darn time and Anita Roddick's success is one reason to think it's discrimination and not lack of ability that's holding women back. And not only was Ms. Roddick's career good for women in general, it was good for the planet too. Body Shop have done a lot to make people think about recycling, fair trade, the environment - all of those things we shouldn't need to be prompted about. It's pretty clear that the world is worse off without Anita Roddick in it, even for those who didn't know her.","","","","","2007-09-11","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Phew, that was a rollercoaster few hours. The proofs came back for a certain wonderfully funny Christmas book - two weeks late due to power failures and whatnot at the printers, so no time to lose. Thankfully I am ludicrously overcautious and built an extra four weeks into the process. Who'd have thought we'd have needed it.","Anyway, the proofs look good and chunky. What a fine little book it's going to be. Problem was, though, that even though they are very low res proofs, just to be used for positioning and checking layout, and not for colour matching, the oranges looked very murky. I went back to the PDF and decided - yes, too murky. No one wants murk for Christmas. It's just not festive. 

So that was about three o'clock. (I forgot to say that the proofs originally got posted to the hotel over the road. I am a genius sleuth and tracked them down, no thanks to the dork at the post office who was NO HELP AT ALL when he insisted it had been delivered. ""Not to me,"" I said. ""I live here, and I do not have the parcel."" ""All I can tell you, madam, is that it's been delivered."" ""NOT TO ME,"" I said. ""I do not have the parcel."" ""All I can tell you, madam, is..."" ""Shut up. Shut up now and tell me *where* you delivered my parcel."" ""I can't tell you that, madam, all I can tell you is that the parcel has been..."" Click.) Since then I have had my head in a stack of books trying to figure out how to de-murk the images. You know what it's like - you eliminate everything until you're left with the most complicated possible solution. ""Ok,"" I was thinking, ""perhaps the rendering intent of the indesign document should be set to relative colorimetric to avoid gamut-clipping. And maybe I should consider exporting to EPS to avoid embedding the ICC profiles in a PDF."" But as always with these things, it was an impossibly simple thing that I'd missed. I realised like an idiot that I only altered the curves of the orange pantone in the duotones dialogue box - not the black one!*

A quick action/droplet later, reopen the indesign doc to auto-update the amended links, a brief stop to feed the cats and a standard output to PDF and bob's your uncle, the new PDF is as I type uploading to the printer's FTP site. 

I only tell you all this because it's kinda nice to have a seemingly impossible problem to solve when you're against the clock, and then to solve it. I also thought I'd share my patent problem solving technique - WWRD? (What would Rob do?) Get out the complicated books, that's what, and work through the problem in a logical way until the obvious jumps out at you. And voila - worked once again! 

In other news: a bat or something keeps throwing itself at my window. Better switch the light off. I thought night animals were all radary? Maybe this one's broken. 




*For people who don't use Photoshop day in, day out, all those solutions probably sound like gobbledygook. You'll just have to trust me when I say only a dumbo wouldn't amend the curves on both duotone colours.","","","","2007-09-11","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Thanks Commenter John (and belatedly thanks Anna too). I should have tried <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/"">Pandora</a> sooner. It's played me more music that I like in two days than even a good radio station would in a month... and there aren't that many good radio stations/music channels.

And all the stuff I've liked on Pandora has been bands I've never heard of: like Ulrich Snauss, G-Spliff and Band (O) Neon. 

If it were recommending books, though, the accuracy would have to be a bit better because it's so much easier and cheaper to flip to the next song than the next novel.

I wonder which is best out of Hamish Hamilton, Viking, Allen Lane Publishing, Penguin, Dorling Kindersley or Rough Guide. Do a couple of them have really good IT systems while others have fabulous PR contacts? Is one weak on recruitment while another can never seem to get a good print deal? Or since they are all owned by Penguin Group and have the same registered office, should I expect that they're all the same people wearing different imaginary hats at different times of the day?","You see, I can't quite decide about imprints. I can see the point of putting 'Rough Guide' instead of 'Penguin' on the jacket because it conveys something to the customer. On the other hand, the new Naomi Klein book is published by Allen Lane and not Penguin; does that help the customer? Will the readers understand the difference or is it not about them? Is it more about publishing tradition?

It certainly would be a shame if the grand old names of publishing gradually vanish, subsumed into mega-brands. On the other hand, if behind the scenes the loss of identity has already happened, then maintaining the fiction with a name seems pointless. And the ex-consultant in me wonders why one would buy up different presses unless it was precisely to merge a good number of the business functions. Why would Rough Guide and Puffin buy photocopiers or rent hire cars separately when they could combine their clout and have the same team handle both? And what about sharing legal, IT, payroll, maintenance, purchasing, finance and office space? If you don't, aren't you just throwing money away? And if you do, is keeping a separate name on the book spines almost deceitful - whether it's intended to be or not.

I'm not accusing anyone of anything, I just haven't quite figured out imprints yet. If you're part of the same company and the whole thing is about printing books then how separate and how much the same do you need to be? And how do you decide? 

Whatever the right answer is, I shall be amazed if it reflects the reality.

<em>Update:</em> Em, both wise and cynical as she is, has pointed out one very sneaky but tangible benefit of imprints. She informs me that certain literary prizes restrict the number of entries not for a particular company, but for a particular imprint. With that in mind, we are considering dividing Snowbooks into a number of imprints called SnowbooksA, SnowbooksB, SnowbooksC and... well, possibly you've worked out the sequence by now. That way we can enter everything we publish for every prize. And while we might alienate the judges, we won't technically be cheating. I wonder if anyone else uses imprints that way.","","","","2007-09-13","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

He really is a genius, that Rob. Honestly, you can ask him anything and he'll either know the answer or, more cleverly, know how to go about getting the answer. 

So this morning I absolutely had to get the printer working. I had done something stupid to it last week and hadn't got round to fixing it - but today I need to print three books out to meet a prize entry deadline. I spent from 7.30 to 9am trying it my way. I think I uninstalled some drivers (turns out I just deleted the shortcut); I swapped the cables for fresh ones and researched the problem on't interweb. Still it didn't work. 

So I gave up and phoned Rob, who, in three minutes flat, had given me a three-step plan to follow. And, of course, it worked. (Uninstall the printer and drivers from Add/ remove programs; restart; reinstall from disc.) Thing is, I could have asked him, to which I would have received a well-thought-through and accurate answer, whether a particularly complicated bit of prose was parsed correctly. Or what to do if my dishwasher was broken. Or how soon after exercise I should eat for optimal insulin levels. Or how to set up the new Waterstone's central distribution centre without melting the company down for six months. 

So in honour of him saving the day once again, and for being a super pal, I am initiating a new occasional strand to this blog, called WWRD? (What Would Rob Do?) Feel free to <a href=""mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"">send in </a>your questions, queries and puzzles on anything from IT to strategy, grammar to DIY.

If you're worried about posting your e-mail address in a blog post or on a web page because automated spamming robots might use it to splurge you with spam, use a <em>picture </em>of your address instead.

I know it's packed with delicious bon-bons of knowledge, but Don and Tony are operating some sort of old-timey strictness whereby you can't have any of the sweet stuff until you've finished your gruel. So far the book is a washing-up bowl full of cold porridge with the promise of the best dessert you've ever tasted if you can get through it.","I'm going to write a bit for you now. My words, but in their style. ""In the new paradigm, catalysing this unlocking of the productive and creative potentials of the market players and their associates, partners, clients and strategic collaborators will usher in an explosion of unprecedented and ultimately unpredictable possibilities as well as pitfalls for the managers, analysts, strategists and visionaries within the various organisations, business entities and spontaneous collaborations of individuals partaking of this profound new suite of opportunities unleashed by the coming together of a novel nexus of forces, tensions, factors and elements which in combination may well bring about a reconfiguration of the very way in which we approach the manufacture, development, distribution and logistical planning of what could well become a revolution in the way we look at, view, think about and ultimately spell the reimagining and reawakening of our unforeseen but undoubtedly inspiring collective future.""

Except they wouldn't have said the bit about 'spelling' because that's a joke. And we wouldn't want a joke in there.

I'm going to damn well persevere with this book because I suspect I will learn a lot of excellent stuff from it. But Don and Anthony should have got down on their knees and pleaded with Malcolm Gladwell to ghost-write the thing for them.

*Using phrases like that doesn't endear me to anyone or make me sound cool does it? I thought not.

Sorry to be a big blurty blog hog today, but I wanted to mention something that happened while I was writing that last post: my neighbour dropped by to give me a jar of crab apple jelly his wife had made and to see if I'd remembered that the village movie night was coming up. I mean really! Why wasn't he angry or belligerently drunk or something? Why wasn't he shouting or trying to borrow money? My urban life has not prepared me for the preposterous levels of warmth and generosity I now have to contend with. And last night my neighbours on the other side invited me round for tea and snacks in a little garden they've built especially for watching the sun go down. It's open to the hills on one side, but enclosed by plants and hedges on the other three. It even has its own outdoor heater so we were toasty and snug. Their cats wandered over too. And I sat drinking tea and eating little delicious dips until the sky was dark enough to see about ten million stars. What on earth was I doing in London all these years?

If you add in Pandora's suggestion that I listen to Acoustic Snails by Infinite Scale and Sasha's Mr Tiddles - both of which, as Anna's friend Jessie would say, rock my socks off - well, all in all it's enough to make a person extremely happy.","","","","","2007-09-14","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

So, the book I'm finding stupidly easy to sell at the moment is Richard Ballantine's City Cycling. People see it, they want it. Thing is, I am a bit busy doing all the other one hundred million things I have to do to keep Snowbooks going. It seems such a shame to have this book that everyone wants but not the time to tell them that it exists. 

So here's the deal. You, friends, can sell it on Snowbooks' behalf. Think of yourself as a bookish Avon Lady, going from house to house, friend to friend, trying to sell orangey make-up - except now you can have a Quality Product that takes no effort to sell at all (providing you are talking to someone who likes cycling - and there are lots of them about). For every copy of City Cycling that you sell, Snowbooks will pay you 2.50! That's right. You only need to shift four copies to get a crisp ten pound note in the post, to exchange for the goods and services that you most desire.

Get your friends to order from www.citycycling.org. Once they've done that, email me with their names and I'll send you your commission! Easy money. 

Go! Sell! The person who sells the most will be names Snowvon Seller of the Month. You need no more incentive than that.","","","","","2007-09-14","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Slightly specialised post here. I'll put it behind a cut because it's mainly for people who've been wracking their brains to understand why language is always evolving. If that's not you, then, as ever, here's a link to <a href=""http://www.cuteoverload.com/"">Cute Overload</a> instead. Remember, there's no shame in not being a colossal nerd. Now off with you; go look at fuzzy things.","OK. Gather round my nerd-like friends. So, here's the conundrum: language obviously evolved as a form of communication - not, you know, as a way of providing lyrics to tunes that had previously been hummed. In fact, it's so obvious, it's difficult to get around. Language is pretty much synonymous with communication. So why does it not converge until everyone can understand everyone else? Why does it keep shifting and altering, dividing large groups into smaller ones and not unifying them instead?

Well, in the Rob view of the world, the answer to that question comes when you understand one of the key roles of vowel shifts and jargon, slang, idiom and private jokes. They're about in-crowds. They enable us to work out whether someone is 'one of us' or an outsider. But the importance of that has little to do with snobbery. It's about trade and specialisation and a sort of pre-monetary form of credit.

Language lets you discuss the reputations of third-parties with those around you. That's not my idea; it's one of the theories explaining the evolution of language. Discussing other people's actions and debating their character and reputations becomes vitally important as soon as a community starts specialising. The hunters can't monitor the gatherers and still hunt - and vice versa. Once you start specialising, lots of people are doing their own thing and you have to trust that they're not freeloading, because freeloading is one of the big problems with extended groups of people - and gossip is the cure. So far so good.

But when the group gets really big - or starts to trade with other groups - the problem of credentials comes up. Does this guy who says he represents the chief from the next village <em>really</em> represent him. Is that guy who's just arrived at the feast really one of us? Without a way to prove membership of a group, it's really difficult to manage the next level of social complexity where communities trade with one another and grow so big that you might not know everyone personally.

Here's where all the weird tics of language - the idioms, the vowel shifts, the slang, the 'bad' grammar - come in. They're shibboleths, badges of membership and they're difficult to fake. 

While languages in general diverge, within some groups language homogenises. Teen and ghetto slang becomes standard across the group very quickly. It's like a new password has been issued and it's passed around until all the right people know it.

The key concept is networks of mutual obligation and entitlement. If a 'group' is not also a network of obligation, then it's use of language will diverge to reflect the 'real' groups. A true member of such a network will have rights within the group, will be able to ask for favours, will be entitled to share in the benefits of the group. They will have 'paid in' as past contributors and will have earned the right to 'make withdrawals' and perhaps to issue commands to other group members - and yet it's difficult to keep track of membership in any large group.

Language change (in my view) is a constant shuffling of codes, changing of passwords and issuing of new team strip (to use a soccer reference). If you're really one of us you'll know the special word we have for a turnip round 'ere. You'll be able to understand the weird gabble the old timers speak. You'll drop your 'h's or 'q's or some other letter and you'll know what we mean by ""Let's book!"" or ""Cave!"" or ""It's the old bill!"" or ""That's so fetch!"".

So there you have it, language divergence is one of the enabling technologies for allowing the expansion of group size in human communities and an authentication mechanism for inter-group trade. Now go on, you know you want to: here's that link to <a href=""http://www.cuteoverload.com/"">Cute Overload</a> where all the less asthmatic kids who don't wear glasses have been for the last five minutes.","","","","2007-09-15","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

It's Saturday night. So what am I doing? I'm trying to master Office 2007 and all its XMLy goodness. Why? Well, I'm trying to find a way to create a nicely laid out Word 2007 document that can be populated with data from an XML file - specifically an Onix file full of information about one of our books. That way I can design a document once and churn out a version for each of our titles at the click of a button.","Thanks in large part to <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/erikaehrli/archive/2006/08/11/word2007DataDocumentGenerationPart1.aspx#698808"">this website</a> this is what you do. 

1) First, create an XML file of one title's records. I used my most recent ONIX file from Anko's APM. I saved it as c:\todaysonix.xml

2) Now, load the XML file into Word. To do this, open Word 2007, create a new file. Now create a new macro (from the developer tab. To show the developer tab, go to the office button, and click Word Options at the bottom of the dialogue box. Click Show Developer Tab in Ribbon) and paste the following into it: 

   ActiveDocument.CustomXMLParts.Add
   ActiveDocument.CustomXMLParts(4).Load (""c:\todaysonix.xml"")

3) Next, create tags in the Word document where you want the XML data to go. On the Developer / Controls tab, insert some plain text content controls. I inserted four of them just to get started. 

4) Now, map the tags to the XML data. Create a new macro, and paste this in: 

Dim strXPath1 As String
strXPath1 = ""/ONIXMessage/Product/ProductIdentifier[ProductIDType='03']/IDValue""
ActiveDocument.ContentControls(1).XMLMapping.SetMapping strXPath1

Dim strXPath2 As String
strXPath2 = ""/ONIXMessage/Product/BICMainSubject""
ActiveDocument.ContentControls(2).XMLMapping.SetMapping strXPath2

Dim strXPath3 As String

5) Run the macros in the word doc (you'll probably have to save it first). And voila, the fields update with the ONIX / XML data. Bingo bango bongo, as I declared when it worked first time. 

6) Now it's working, you can add as many ONIX fields as you like, and format it to taste. Then once it's done, you can save it as a template and use it to produce as many different documents as you like from your various ONIX title files. 

Whoopdeedoo, yet another way that I can avoid re-typing data the whole time. Tomorrow I might try this in Excel to see if I can autopopulate the retailer Excel files that take so much time. I'm probably not going to use the Word thing all that much, because using XSLT to create xhtml files + css seems more flexible but I wanted to know how to do it, just because it would bug me otherwise. Word 2007, I have vanquished you.","","","","2007-09-15","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

(For newcomers, the deadly green 'P' warns of politics. Eeek. Gasp.)","Apparently once the IMF had got the strip-mining of the Russian economy underway following the collapse of the USSR, and living standards had plummeted compared to the bad old days of communism, some unsettlingly large fraction of the Russian people thought that what the country needed to get it back on track was a man like Stalin. Despite the fact he killed more people than Hitler.

And law and order fans in England sometimes mention the Krays (=post-War East London gangsters) in appreciative tones. Yes, they were murdering crooks, but it was safe for women to walk the streets at night on their manor. Allegedly.

I mention all this because of the irony of Iraq. Saddam Hussein was exactly the sort of leader the law-and-order types who support Bush would thoroughly approve of. Look at what the U.S. is doing to its own citizens right now. Spying on them, locking them up without trial, even getting up its nerve to torture them. But we're not supposed to panic, because if you're decent folk who haven't done anything wrong then you're not in any danger. (Though how you prove you did nothing wrong now that Habeas Corpus is gone I have no idea.)  And it was the same under Saddam. If you did as you were told and kept your mouth shut, Iraq was probably the most liberal and (to our eyes) agreeable of places to live in the Middle East. Women could wear jeans as they drove their cars to their University classes. When they graduated, they could nip off to the States to do a Masters degree if they could afford it. They could be atheists if they wanted to be too. Saddam had no time for Islamic law. 

It's a very different situation somewhere like Saudi Arabia - a fascist state we feel no need to attack. In fact, heck, we value <a href=""http://money.guardian.co.uk/news_/story/0,,2169957,00.html"">their business</a>. Even if it is mainly weapons that they buy from us. What am I saying, the UK is the second biggest arms dealer in the world. We're delighted to sell them weapons. 

But back to Saddam-era Iraq. Now, I'll admit it wasn't all good. It's true that if you stepped out of line you might quickly find yourself in a basement somewhere having your **** pulled off with a ***** (supply your own delicate region/garden implement). And as such, I'd have been against it. But those are also the kind of policies the U.S. is inching towards. And if that's what it takes to keep America safe these days, what was wrong with Saddam doing it? Yes, if you want ironies, I can't help thinking that Saddam's Iraq is just the sort of place the Neo-Cons would like to turn America into.

Maybe this counts as politics too, but let's give it the benefit of the doubt and just say it's about something interesting. I'd also like to make it clear that although this post involves the work of Naomi Klein, I'm not just mentioning it because she's scrumptious. Although any woman who's that daring, moral, eloquent, insightful - and who can giggle attractively when talking about being tear-gassed - deserves the occasional mention here. Phew. Is it me or is it a bit warm in here?

Ahem. Anyway 'The Take' is her husband's film, with Ms. Klein in a supporting role. The two of them, plus a dozen or so crew went to Argentina because of a new form of business they'd heard about there.","The background to the story is the collapse of Argentina's economy. Sorry to slag off the IMF twice in one day, but taking their money when your economy is struggling is akin to asking the Big Bad Wolf to look after your grandmother for you. And, as always happens when someone follows their advice, Argentina's economy tanked. After which they still expect their money back.

As the economy collapsed, lots of factories closed down, lots of workers lost their jobs. Factory owners would declare bankruptcy and walk away. The workforce would be out on the street. Factories were left to rust. 

Except that some of the sacked workers looked at the abandoned factories they used to run and decided they didn't need their old bosses to tell them what to do. The guys who used to operate the machines and drive the trucks reckoned they could go back to work despite having no one telling them what to do. And that's what drew Naomi Klein and her hubbie, Avi Lewis, to Argentina.

Workers who'd been out of a job for months, or years, would band together and reopen their old factories - often paying the same wage to everyone and making their decisions by ballot - and many of these businesses were becoming profitable. At which point their former owners would often reappear expecting to be in charge once again. Their land, their machines, their factory. The fact that they were happy to walk away and leave the place chained up didn't affect their legal rights to return when they once again saw the chance to make some money. 

Now doesn't that sound like a story you might want to watch? Middle-aged seamstresses reopening their little garment factory - doing a better job of running it than the managers who'd sacked them and closed the place down - who are then accused of being criminals for going back to work and who find themselves barred from their business by hundreds of police in riot gear.

Don't you want to know how it all turns out?

Unbelievably, I can't find any sign that you can buy <em>The Take</em> in the UK - or in a Region 2 version (which is the DVD region that includes the U.K.). If you want a copy then <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Take-Naomi-Klein/dp/B000CCD1X4"">Amazon.com</a> will send you one - just make sure you can play Region 1 NTSC DVDs first. If you have no idea what that last sentence means, then e-mail me with the make and model of your DVD player and TV and I'll help you figure out how you can play the U.S. version of the movie.

(Also, if you own a UK DVD distribution company, maybe you could get cracking on a Region 1 version. Given that I can produce one (if only the law allowed me to) in about two hours using a home PC, it shouldn't take you long.)

Neither of them mentioned the Snowblog <em>specifically</em> but it seems clear to me that Bruce reads it and passes on the good stuff to Bill.

(I reckon this one's a corker!)","Legacy

1915


The boy sat on his haunches with his trouser leg hitched up exposing the bare, jutting ankle. He cast his gaze from left to right, all the while gnawing at the tattered nails on his fingers. He had seen the prize some twenty minutes earlier; then the moon had been full and the smashed wall lit by its glow but now the shadows crept from the east, shrouding his view.

The body was situated at least twenty feet in front of him and to the left across the track that led to the farm. It was wearing a field uniform of a dark colour which had been rendered even darker by the stain of blood that had poured from its shattered skull and it lay spread-eagled on the rubble. A toy discarded by a feckless child. The remains of the head sat crazily on the shoulder, the one eye staring, shocked and the extended limbs straining against the torso. The pitted farm road was slick and muddied with puddles of unknown depth and behind the wall a crater still smouldered and hissed.

The boy looked to the sky and watched the cloud snuff out the last light as the fires danced on the horizon. He eased himself to a standing position and stepped out of the hiding place, listening intently.

The sounds did not change. 

The relentless crump, the crack of a rifle as a sniper played the line and a mewling from beyond the wire in the distance; but these sounds had all been there before. He avoided the puddles and was soon by the body; it was barely cool despite the cold of the night. He reached under the stiffening corpse and grasped the webbing of the uniform and then, bracing his legs against the fallen bricks, he rolled the dead weight until its chest was against the stones. 

He looked up again and checked the road. It was clear and quiet and unusually still, as if a breath was being held. He returned to his task, urgent now, opening the small canvas knapsack that hung round his shoulder and neck and taking out a bundle of cloth that he deftly unrolled. The knife within was sharp and dry and clean. His breath became hotter as he cut the trouser leg of the corpse from the hip to the knee and across the buttock to the base of the spine. The blade ploughed through the thick material as if through gossamer. Replacing the knife he ripped at the trousers, his hands now slick with mud. The textile held and then tore exposing the pale skin within. The boy reached into his sack once more and took out a roll of newspaper and two pieces of sacking string, placing them onto the back of the torso.

He re-gripped the knife and, with a sawing movement, cut into the now cold flesh. His breaths came in pants. 

Suddenly the moonlight burst from the sky. 

The boy stopped still.

When was the last time you looked at snowbooks.com - the homepage, I mean? Do you go there every time you visit the site, or do you come straight to the blog? It's of passing curiosity to us - that and other stats about snowbooks.com. This morning we were trying to figure out what our stats mean. The numbers are either vast, or massively skewed by the fact that I visit the site around three times a day. Since January this year we have had: 

1,769,431 hits
332,523 pages viewed","131,912 visits
and 
68,124 unique visitors

If anyone can tell me whether that's good or bad, do! 
Anyway, purpose of this post is to tell you that snowbooks.com's homepage has been updated. (What am I saying, talking in the third person like this...) I have updated snowbooks.com's homepage! (Much better.) If I had more time and skillz I would have made the snowglobe a shaky one, and you could have turned it upside down and shaken it.

Hey, anyone want to invite me to the Bookseller Retail Awards on Thursday? I am polite and entertaining, and scrub up nicely so won't be too much of an eyesore on your table (that a person can only sit at if she has bought or has been given a very expensive ticket). I can laugh in the right places at jokes, and can also talk sensibly about current affairs in publishing and the wider world, as well as strategy and trading tactics. I am moderately indiscreet about things that don't matter too much, so good for low-level gossip. I don't drink much so there will be no messy clearing up at the end of the evening. Oh, and I am bubbly with a GSOH.

Snowbooks started out with hardly any non-fiction, but we're planning to gradually add more into the mix. We've already talked about why. It's easier to spot gaps in the market with non-fiction. And 'good' is less a matter of taste and more a matter of standards. Both of those mean our hard work is less of a gamble and more likely to pay off. And non-fiction titles often benefit from colour and pictures in a way that novels don't. And that's good because it's more difficult to self-publish graphics-heavy books and less likely that an e-book reader will be able to do a good job of displaying them any time soon.

With that in mind I'm thinking of talking about and reviewing lots of non-fiction on this here blog and I'm wondering whether I might be out of step with the current make up of the Snowblog readership. So who are you people? When you tot up the books you read in a year, what's the ratio of fiction to non-fiction titles? I'd love to know. I could quite imagine that the average Snowblogger is 20:1 Fiction to Non-Fiction. Maybe higher. Am I right? I used to be like that: 50-60 novels per year and a couple of non-fiction titles, probably pop science books. But now I'd say my ratio was more like 1:20. Anyone else undergone a change like that? Maybe someone with a ratio like 1F:20NF wouldn't be visiting the Snowblog in the first place.

I'm guilty of it myself, but do you find that when you think of publishing, your first thought is always fiction?","","","","","2007-09-20","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","13"

Em and I went to visit Haynes yesterday. As someone who used to lie underneath cheap cars trying to fix them, the trip was quite a treat. I even came away with a free copy of the book you can see in the picture. And yes, given a choice, that was the one I picked. It's nerdilicious. 

The Chaps at Haynes print an awful lot of manuals, and they also handle other people's printing too - including some of ours. They don't necessarily look like shrewd business types (I hope they don't mind me saying so); they look more like engineers, but they certainly know how to run a business. As well as being good at what they do and very easy to talk to, they also put on a good spread: in this case a nice steak and kidney pie in the pub across the road, followed by apple crumble and custard. What with that, a look at a few Heidelberg Speedmasters, and a free manual on engine modification, the whole day out was a treat for my 'y' chromosome.

"41175","","1","Cool things in Adobe CS3","Publish","true","Probably more for my benefit than anyone's, here's my Top Ten list of cool things that the new (well, new to me after they took the best part of a year to deliver it) Adobe CS3 does. Geeks only, read on. 

<img alt=""device.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/device.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""280"" />","1) Share swatches across applications - so now a swatch library in Indesign can be used in Photoshop and Illustrator. Create a set of swatches, then choose Save Swatches for Exchange. The .ase file containing the swatches is saved to the Presets> Swatches folder where you can load it from into other applications. 

2) Adobe Bridge can be used to ensure colour consistency across applications. I never use Bridge because it takes ages to start but it seems to be fixed in CS3. Bridge's batching functions are also double-plus cool - batch Live Trace, anyone? 

3) Preview work as they'll look on mobile devices in Device Central. In PS, go to File>Save for Web and Devices>Device Central. Makes me salivate, I'm afraid to say. (See picture)

4)  Create pdfs from webpages in Acrobat 8. It's not a brand new feature, but it works a charm. And want to hear the commercial application of that? A buyer at a certain massive retailer told me this morning that our latest sales materials knock other publishers' into a cocked hat. My words, not his, but I was mighty pleased. 

5) Export Indesign content as XHTML. Yes, you heard me right. 

6) Multi file place in Indesign. No more placing 900 individual files. Thank you, god of indesign, thank you.

7) I don't use Dreamweaver, but some of the things it says it can do, like integrating data into web pages using XML (i.e. ONIX) from an RSS feed sound so tantalising. That's booked in for a post-Frankfurt weekend when I have a bit of time to explore!

8) Object styles! Saved my neck on City Cycling - and that's the first book I've done that is so immaculately laid out, if I deleted all the pages and autoflowed it from scratch it would come out exactly the same. It makes me happy. 

9) Creating interactive documents. Oh, if only I had the time! Imagine an e-book (pdf) where if you hover over a paragraph, an audio file reads it out to you, or if you click on a picture it runs a video that enhances the text. It's all there, easy as anything to do with tools that cost less than a modest print run. Now all I have to do is find the time... 

10) Built in Adobe Time machine. From Bridge, go to Tools>Distort>Fabric of Space Time. Optimise your working hours by including one 100-hour day every fortnight. Never miss deadlines again! 

There are still annoying things that I bet they have a fix for, but won't release this time round because, heck, how will they be able to release and charge for another edition next year? Indexing, for instance, is still a rather stone-age feature. And the US/UK pricing debacle still rankles. But that aside - CS3 is an astonishing bargain and enables micro publishers like us to operate a business that is as professional and slick as the multinationals.","","","","2007-09-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Here it is, blogpost number 500. We asked you what you'd like this landmark blogpost to be about, and you suggested a 'story so far' piece might be nice. So here it is.","There's a <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/pressinfo.html"">timeline of events</a> on the press page which gives you the bare bones. And by reading the blog you know a lot about our outlook: how we like progress and computers, and spend a lot of time thinking about the role of publishers. You know that we take a pride in our work and that's our overall motivator: we'd rather think of ourselves as craftsmen than ruthlessly efficient business types - although we come with business strategy modules built in to our heads. Why don't I go right back to the beginning, to the genesis of Snowbooks (as best I remember it!) and tell you where it all came from. 

In August 2002 I was working at Deloitte, and Rob was doing an MSc. having recently left ITIM, a boutique management consultancy. Both of us were depressed with the idea of consulting. My job consisted mostly of pitching for business - huge amounts of business, such as a &pound;10m SAP implementation or a &pound;5m cost reduction programme. Worse, some of these pitches were to public sector companies - and I knew full well that the consultancy would drain the public purse of money and do bugger all to resolve actual problems. Not only that, but the work was really, really boring with incredibly long hours - for instance, M&A due diligence is done in a week or two, so that's a week, or two, of 20 hour days (no kidding); pitches are done, on powerpoint, in a week with a team of 10 in a meeting room. More than once we worked through the night; once my colleague worked from 8am to 4pm *the following day* then got in a cab with the finished pitches and travelled to Birmingham, from London, to hand deliver the documents to the client. I was compensating for my awful job by spending my really quite substantial income on a fast car, haircuts every two weeks, eating out every night, drinking a fair amount and basically getting through life without living it. For a while it was fun; you have money, you're young(ish), you have all of London to abuse, your colleagues are bright and the crazywork actually means you have a sense of cameraderie with those other poor fools you're working with. But if you have an epiphany - if you realise what a load of nonsense it all is, even for a moment - that's it, you can't go back. I know there are far worse things that could be afflicting a person than having a boring job, which is what all this comes down to. But disgust for it all gets to you and the sense that your life is slipping away while you do nothing much except drink or design powerpoint slides becomes unbearable. 

So against that background, what happened? Rob and I were best friends; we knew each other from Superdrug, where I started my career on the Kingfisher Management Development Scheme and where Rob worked in Business Planning. Naturally once it had dawned on us that we were wasting our lives, we got to talking about what we could do. At one point I thought running a deli would be a good idea, at a high-footfall location where commuters could buy a tasty treat from us for their dinner. What an astonishingly bad idea that would have been, given how awful I am at cooking. I ditched that idea after six months of planning revealed that the numbers just didn't stack up. So, back to the drawing board. The important thing was that we wanted to do something meaningful - the antithesis of consulting. We wanted to be proud of ourselves and our work, and to do something that mattered. Hmmm, but what? 

Rob had always wanted to write a book and got a contract with a non-trade publisher (naming no names) to write it. It was - is - about retail strategy and is the finest book of its kind - content-wise, at least. He got a small advance and took 6 months off work to write it. It's quite Seth Godin in style: searing insight and thorough analysis delivered in a light, entertaining style. Probably would have been an ideal candidate for a B format paperback (not that I knew what a B format paperback was at the time). But the publisher in question didn't do that. First, rather than looking at the book for what it was - a pop business paperback candidate - they put it out in a &pound;28 hardback with an uninspiring jacket image. Essentially they had taken a book and fed it into the way they always do things - we worked out after the fact that their model must be to publish a high number of high-retail-price hardbacks, breaking even by selling 500 units of each to a limited market, without marketing support or much effort of any kind, and then to get their profit from the titles that took off all by themselves. Disappointing to an author if you don't know about it in advance, though it probably works - but it was enough to get us thinking, and encouraged us to poke around a bit more in the publishing industry.  

And boy, did we find some interesting things. Such as, for instance, the barriers to entry for publishing were remarkably low. The ranges in the retailers were huge - far more books get selected for inclusion in a range than I ever would have listed when I was a buyer at B&Q or Superdrug. The industry seemed to be mired in convention - doing things in a particular way because that's the way they've always done it. There were some really cool pieces of software on the market that seemed to allow a tiny publisher to operate on the same level as a larger publisher. Not knowing anything, I couldn't quite believe this - I thought I must be missing a huge part of the puzzle and that it would dawn on me that it couldn't be that simple. (I'm still waiting...)

So we formed a bit of a plan. Rob would write another book - the thriller he'd been thinking about for the last few years - and I would take a sabbatical from Deloitte to set up a company to publish it and a few other books. Like a lot of people, this was a plan formed down at the pub (although I think Rob had given up drinking by then, so maybe it was a cafe. Oh yes! The greasy spoon in South Croydon - remember, Rob?) and like a lot of plans it might never have come to anything - except I met Andy. Within three months I'd moved in with him, and within six I'd sold my flat, cashing in the last of the money I'd saved whilst doing up houses. (I bought my first flat in Colliers Wood in 1996 and sold it a few months later, once my lovely dad had put in a new kitchen, for about 15% more. I thought 'hello, that was interesting' and bought and sold a house once a year, on average, for the next six years, doing it up myself. And that was how I raised the money to put my share into Snowbooks - no loans and no outside shareholders. Oh, and I am never going to do any DIY ever again.) The game was afoot! 

But I found it really hard to stop being a consultant. My previous roles either required huge spreadsheets of product information and sales performance, or powerpoint slides of strategy - but strategy written as a sales pitch. I found myself writing great long business plans - beautifully presented, I have to say, but pointless. I was used to pitching and spinning - now I only had myself to pitch to. 

And oh, god, the language problem! It took me a good year to remember how to talk properly. I couldn't talk about the business plans without mentioning how our holistic approach enables vertical connectivity between the product  operations team and the quality assurance technicians to optimize consumer impact points. Or whatever. 

Anyway, we plugged away, writing business plans that, frankly, bear no resemblance at all to the business that stands in front of you today. A couple of wonderful things happened. Firstly, Deloitte made me redundant. Ka-ching, another lump sum in our start-up fund. Secondly, I got accepted by the Digital Incubator for London (now the Innovatory) who provided office space on Old Street on the absolute cheap. These two things enabled (eek, I'm slipping back into consultant vernacular) me to shift my head space (Argh! Help me!) to focus solely on the business. When I was on sabbatical, there was a get-out clause - if it didn't work, I could go back to a salaried job. And if I'd been working from my spare bedroom I could have pretended it was just a hobby. But now there was no safety net and someone had believed in our plan enough to want to help us out with office space. We were away! 

The first six months was spent getting some books together. Man, it took a long time. I remember Gilly (our first permanent hire) and I trying to figure out how to create a PDF. It took us all morning! We got there in the end, and then came the moment of truth - trying to sell the things. Gilly and I sat at our little meeting table and started to brainstorm - I wanted to write down all the things I ever wanted my suppliers to do for me when I had been a buyer. They used to drive me crazy - asking for meetings just because it would make their bosses happy, which would eat up my day. Never giving me a straight answer on what their cost base was so I could work out how to offer them a fair cost price. Promising the earth and then failing to get the stock to us. Going behind my back to my boss to ask him to overrule me when I delisted something. Grr. Thing about buying is, it's a vicious environment and it's every man for himself. There's only so much space in store and whilst products are mainly allocated based on productivity, a lot of it has to do with how effective the buyer is at managing the politics of the organisation. 

So we wrote down the attributes of the perfect supplier, and then set to work making sure that <em>we</em> were that supplier. We created an info pack on each of our titles, which included basic supply chain data like the pallet ti-his (dimensions), availability promises and the lead times we could achieve. We could promise to work via EDI (electronic data interchange) and meet timed delivery slots because the wonderful Bridget from <a href=""http://www.lbsltd.co.uk"">LBS </a>had met us, seen the potential and signed us up (for which I will be forever grateful). We solicited feedback from readers. We researched the retailers' strategic objectives and made sure that our books were going to support them. We analysed each category, looked at the trends and what worked, and illustrated how our books fit well into the genre. We printed it out in colour and bound it up in a nice, frosted A5 ring binder. The end result was an info pack (or 'Buyers Fun Pack' as Rob tries to insist we call them) that contained everything the buyer could need to know about the book - but more importantly, it was something the buyer could take to her Monday Morning Meeting and wave around and say 'look what I get my suppliers to do'. The aim was to make the buyer look good in her bosses' eyes - which was exactly what I wanted my suppliers to do when I was in that position. 

And by jiminy it worked. I got an email from Suzie Doore (now at Hodder, then at Waterstone's) who seemed intrigued and asked me in for a meeting. At that meeting was <a href=""http://meandmybigmouth.typepad.com/"">Scott Pack</a>, then Buying Manager of Waterstone's. As I recall, the two of them sat me down and said something along the lines of ""Who the hell are you? We've never heard of you and then out of the blue you send in this info pack - with our logo on it!"" (that seemed to go down particularly well). They reckoned it was a more thorough approach than any of their other publishers bothered to take. ""Tell you what,"" said Scott, ""we'll take all of your books and put them onto our front of store 3 for 2 promotion."" <em>Tell you what</em>, I thought, <em>bloody hell, we've done it!</em> And, brilliantly, Adept (Rob's book) took off and sold tens of thousands of copies. We were on our way. 

Many things came together to get Snowbooks off the ground - the luck of being made redundant, the wonderfulness of Andy in believing in me when he hardly knew me, the genius of Rob's writing, the leg-up that our commercial background gave us. But the single greatest thing that breathed life into Snowbooks was Scott and Susie's decision that day to back us, to take a punt, to support a tiny publisher who needed that one chance to prove themselves. I will always be incredibly grateful for that. Thank you, chaps. 

And that is how Snowbooks came to be.","","","","2007-09-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","9"

Will I have to start putting a 'G' on these sorts of posts to give you fair warning, the way I do now with the fearsome 'P' for politics? It's just that we live in a geeky time. I've been reading and enjoying <a href=""http://www.stephenfry.com/blog/"">Stephen Fry's</a> first blog post. <em>[<- link was broken, now fixed]</em> And is he writing about film-making, or opera or perhaps the Victorian Novel? No, he's giving an off-the-cuff and encyclopedic run-down of the history of SmartPhones. That's mobile phones with extra, computer-like features, to the jargonless among you.","If you've a mind to read his post, maybe you should do that, and then, if you feel like it, you could nip back here and read my comments about it below. Ta.

Turns out Stephen is hacked off and disappointed with most of the exciting new gadgets that cross his path. Now, if I had achieved the pressure-equalising level of fame required to talk to Stephen (see <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/why_be_famous.html#more"">previous post</a>) I'd tell him about people who get fed up with the way their mobile phones work and write their own software for them. My phone is chock full of features and settings that neither Orange nor Microsoft intended. I don't mean just adding programs, I mean altering the operating system. For instance, with a press of a button I can lock the flash on the phone's camera on, and use it as a torch to find my front doorlock in the inky blackness of the night-time countryside. I've also got a screen for turning off various annoying features and adding other more useful ones. All of that is impossible with the standard phone. And it goes without saying that it comes with built-in software for reading books on its big screen (if only the display was a leeetle bit better...).

I don't think it will be long now before there's an open source operating system for smartphones that does exactly what the community who write it want it to. And you can bet it'll be a hell of a lot better than the off-the-shelf corporate offering. And it will also be free.

In fact, consider this idea (that I read in the brilliant <a href=""http://www.makezine.com/"">Make magazine</a>). What if our mobile phones all acted as base stations for each other, passing other people's calls on to the next phone in the line, all without us being aware of it. Any dense population centre would then have a mobile phone network as soon as it had enough mobile phones switched on. Maybe no need for network providers or phone bills. I doubt that Orange will introduce such a feature any time soon, but that doesn't mean they can necessarily stop the world coming up with it.

As ever, most of us had better hope that the ingenious geeks out there never pay too much attention to the world of books. Otherwise the publishing game-board will be up for a good hard shake.","","","","2007-09-21","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Absolutely brilliant news has come through that Borders UK, which was up for sale by its US parent company, has successfully been bought by Luke Johnson and will remain under David Roche's control. Any other solution - and the options ranging from shipbreaking to one that would involve integration with another business (read months of eye-off-the-ball and closures) - would have spelled disaster, for them and us.

I've just read a rubbish book on cover design. The author of Designing Books: Practice and Theory is obsessed with the, apparantly raging, argument that exists between designers who favour symmetry in their design, and those who inisist on asymmetry. Ironically his captions are almost impossible to decipher or figure out which image they relate to. His use of language is clunktastic (""Disputatious all his life, [Tschichold] found himself proclaiming much that was exactly opposite to what he held to be correct in 1928."")  Disputatious? Lawks. Sadly, the examples that he gave throughout the book - in much the same way as the examples of cover design I saw a few months back at a lecture on book design at the RSA - were to my eye jarring, poorly formed, laboured and often archaic-looking. 

Maybe I'm insufficiently educated. Maybe I have terrible judgement. Perhaps. But instead, here are a few of my views on cover design.","1) The cover has to position the book in its genre. 

<img alt=""death.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/death.jpg"" width=""400""  />

Easy, really, to check if you've got this one right. Take a copy of your book cover into store, go to the relevant shelf and see if it fits. Does it stand out? If it does, it's probably wrong. The blurb and the cover and the writing is unique, but the only way the reader will discover it is if the packaging explains, at a subconscious level, what the words are about. You wouldn't expect to open a cornflakes pack and find pasta, would you? Same deal. 


2) The elements of the cover have to blend. 

<img alt=""lit copy.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/lit%20copy.jpg"" width=""400""  />

Often the font of the title can look plonked. Make sure that the layout of the words, like on these fine books, is integrated with the image. 

3) Observe genre conventions. 

A bit like #1, but here are some rules of thumb: 
- Crime has a 'destroy' type font (see Death Artist and the Kathryn Fox, above)
- Zombie / werewolf / vampire horror has a layer or two of distressing: 

<img alt=""horror.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/horror.jpg"" width=""400""  />

- Commercial fiction aimed at women has a handwritten font

<img alt=""plot.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/plot.jpg"" width=""400"" />

Of course all these rules are to be broken at will - but they are excellent starting points in a cover design project. I'll add to these 'rules' as I think of them!  Right now I have to go to prepare for the Gardners trade show tomorrow. See you there if you're going!","","","","2007-09-22","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

I'm about halfway through Naomi Klein's new book <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/showbook.php?id=0713998997"">The Shock Doctrine</a>. I want to describe it but I'm sorry I can't do it without using the same words that you'll have heard applied to so many other titles so many times before. It's 'masterful' and 'magnificent' and absolutely readable and fairly writhing with horrors. And what's depressing me is not the contents of the book, because I have read dozens of others like it (though probably none as well written and researched) so the facts alone aren't surprising to me any more. What's depressing is that this book could change the world; and yet it probably won't. It will be read by the sort of people who read these books and by no one else. And yet if the information within its covers somehow reached ordinary people, the world would shift because of it. Democracy would see to that. The disgust and revulsion we'd all feel would affect the way we scrutinise our politicians, it would change what we demand of them, and they would respond or entirely lose the confidence of their electorates. That's all it would take. Enough people to read a book. And yet I doubt it will happen and there's something so depressing about that, especially for a publisher.

Thanks, all, for sharing a bit about what you read. So right now I'm really obsessed with the <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/showbook.php?id=0713998997"">new Naomi Klein book</a>, think it's stunningly good, and I see it as an interesting way of understanding the non-fiction market. I can see from what you've said about your ratios of fiction to non-fiction - and the fact that biography/memoirs and (non-modern) history are the fave non-fiction areas - that very few of you are likely to pick it up. Would anything change your mind? Say:
1) The Harry Potter Effect: you see everyone else reading it and even though it's not your usual thing you decide to give it a try
2) Money: As commenter Keith imagined, what if Tesco's were giving it away? Is there a price-point where you'd think, 'oh why not'?
3) Negative Publicity: if bookstores or the government banned it would you seek it out?
4) TV tie-ins: would a really interesting documentary or documentary series interest you in the book?
5) Personal Recommendation from a cool friend maybe?
Or any other suggestions. What would make you buy a book like <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/showbook.php?id=0713998997"">The Shock Doctrine</a>?","","","","","2007-09-24","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","8"

It bans violence, it preaches tolerance, compassion, forgiveness and generosity. And it issues dire warnings about being materialistic or putting money above people. These are exactly the virtues and values this world needs. If Mr Christ could have said something about caring for the planet, it would have been perfect. Oh, and I don't see the point of blind faith, but these are mere quibbles; the overall message is one I heartily agree with. So how can there be pro-war Christians? There's no way you can twist Jesus's words to permit killing, surely. And what's the problem with gay bishops? Would Jesus really have shunned gay people? If so, maybe I was wrong about what a nice fellow he was. And why were the church so reluctant to let women be in charge of anything? Surely Christians should be leading our society in equality and tolerance, not lagging behind. If this is their idea of moral leadership then they've got a heck of a lot of catching up to do. Come on Christian folk: it's about tolerance, forgivenesss and love. It's not about tradition, having the ear of government and judging others. Will you have a word with your leaders and set them straight about this stuff?","","","","2007-09-27","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

I am taking breaks in between dancing my excited dance to type this post. It's their only UK show next year where they will be, no doubt, playing from their... NEW ALBUM. Best News Ever. 


---------------------

Update, some minutes later:

Hmm. Dancing is all well and good but if it means you fall over and sprain your ankle, as I have just done, it rather detracts from the celebrations. Bah. No Bicester Shopping Village for me, today, which was my other birthday treat. Bah.

If you're waiting for a reply to an email you've sent me, sorry for the delay. I was on the road most of last week, first at the Gardners Trade show, then Windsor, then LBS in Worthing, then to London, and then in meetings all yesterday. So I have neither done much work nor answered many emails. I'm bound to have cleared most of them by Monday night, so shouldn't be too much longer.

Now there are many things I don't understand, but here's one that's often bothered me. In America, a small town can have a gigantic Barnes & Noble or Borders bookstore and in the UK only a major town can sustain such a thing. And forgive me for saying this, but  when attempting to complete the unfinished sentence 'The average American is...' very few people would suggest 'relentlessly bookish' as their answer. America doesn't have a culture that particularly glorifies the bookworm, but somehow it has an economy that encourages the mega-bookstore. Or maybe it's that the UK has an economy that<em> discourages</em> big shops for small towns.","Now for all I know, Barnes & Noble beat their employees and use homeless kittens as packing material - I have no data on that - but I do know how wonderful it is to arrive in a little town in the States, small enough that the centre of town is only a two minute drive from open fields, and be able to find a bookstore the size of a football field, with somewhere to get coffee and buy magazines and look at little interesting notebooks and pens - and to browse through thousands upon thousands of books. In the States a settlement of 20,000 might have a store like that; in the UK it's more like 500,000. I'm guessing wildly at the figures, but I'm not imagining the disparity.

Now, apparently labour is cheaper in the US. But then again, big bookstores are not exactly crammed with staff. If that was all that was holding us back, then why not apologise to all concerned and replace the information desk with a telephone or computer? And why not try out some of those self-service tills that supermarkets have? Personally, I wouldn't care if browsing for books never brought me into contact with a human. Some days I'd actually prefer it. Or is it the back-room staff that cost the money? We can afford people to arrange lettuces but not books?

Also, land is cheaper in the US. Doesn't that mean we could still have small communities with large bookstores in Wales or parts of Yorkshire? But we don't, do we?

And don't tell me that books are cheaper here so margins are slimmer. I own at least a hundred books where the dollar price is printed on the back and it's within 25% of the sterling price. And those two currencies have never been within 25% of each other as long as I've been reading. There's a fat mark-up when you compare dollar to sterling, at least on the books I own.

So is it really that Americans just like books more than Brits? Really? Huh.","","","","2007-09-30","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

Time for more you-heard-it-here-first, gee-whiz science. Unlike the linguistic divergence thing (remember that? No? OK, never mind) this one isn't mine. It's probably the idea of Thomas Gold, late of Cornell University.","You were taught in school, those of you who attended one, that life originated on Earth in little gloopy pools of water, with lightning playing in the distance. But more recently it's been discovered that the microbes which live under the sea, in the boiling water of volcanic vents, are older than anything else on Earth. So now some people wonder whether life originated there instead and gradually spread out and reached the surface.

But a better theory is that life originated far underground. You see photosynthesis is difficult. And these volcanic vents, known as 'black smokers', are hostile places. What life needed to get it going was a stable, safe, unchanging environment where it could perfect the basic processes of growth, replication, feeding and repair. What a very few people believe, and I agree with them, is that life started aeons ago in the airless depths, powering itself using simple chemical reactions. Eventually it proved resilient enough to emerge and flourish in the caustic cauldron of volcanic vents. And from there it could gradually adapt and spread into the ocean, before eventually mastering the trick of photosynthesis and conquering the surface.

Weirdly there's a problem with that explanation and it's a problem that, unless you're a geologist, you'll probably never guess. The problem is that the earliest lifeforms would have needed a supply of raw materials to construct themselves from including long-chain carbon compounds, like the sorts of things found in oil. But oil, natural gas, coal - everything like that - as you'll also know if you went to school, is made from the remains of living creatures, so it couldn't have been around to help life get started. Or could it? For the answer to that conundrum tune in to the next instalment of Rob's Big Hokey Science Jamboree.","","","","2007-09-30","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

But if you're going to the bother of buying another copy, I'm guessing it's because you loved it, and want to share the book with a friend.

So <a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/"">the Bookseller</a> reports on a piece of marketing that Orion are doing for their famous author Lisa Gardner. Sadly the piece is subscription only so I will judiciously choose extracts here to illustrate the point I may get round to making soon.","The publisher has produced a video featuring ""Orion staff members"". They are placing it on YouTube! And Facebook! Ooooh. 

[They will also pay a gazillion pounds for tube advertising and a national poster campaign.] 

All the marketing will point to a website they've built *especially*, called <a href=""http://www.twistsandturns.co.uk"">www.twistsandturns.co.uk</a> Don't bother clicking on the link - the site either doesn't exist or isn't live yet. Why would it be - after all, the press release has only gone to The Bookseller. The website will, apparently, feature the video trailer, and samples from the book. Imagine. 

//update, later. It's live now. It has a 'skip intro' page and non-clickable links - fancy. It has so little content, my eye searches out every last bit, and falls on the link to their legal T&C page - nice. Double bonus - it's not a link, it's a flash image. The video. You have to watch <a href=""http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=meF8_wy7u5Y"">the video</a>. And not because of how chilling it is.//

Sorry for the heavy sarcasm here, but honestly. A website that doesn't work and hardly sounds groundbreaking. Putting stuff on 'social networking sites' - well aren't you modern? It just bugs me that these people have, I am assuming, many many thousands more pounds and man-hours than us to promote their books, and they do such a, well, *grey* job.  And the book will sell because of the traditional ad campaign and the retail sell in, not because of their online activities.

You want some cutting edge stuff? Visit <a href=""http://www.cookingwithbooze.org"">cookingwithbooze.org</a>, written by <a href=""http://www.booktwo.org"">James</a>. The text is tagged and adheres to standards so the recipes can be easily displayed and read. It will also ensure that the book will be available to read for decades to come - you try playing betamax videos nowadays. James has shot his own promotional videos. He updates its blog properly. You can get the recipes on your mobile phone. He invites feedback from the web. It is licensed under Creative Commons. The website text comes straight from an XML file outputted from Indesign where James typeset the book using paragraph and character styles, for efficiency and accuracy. He has invented his own microformat for recipes. Find out all this and more <a href=""http://cookingwithbooze.org/for-geeks/"">here. </a> This campaign - done for barely any money, is stuffed full of brand new initiatives. Orion's online campaign, dull as it is, probably cost thousands. 

I don't know why I'm cross: if tiny publishers can do cool things much better than the big publishers, then that's a good thing for us.

You know, I tend to have a bad habit of talking about gloomy or depressing things. My motivation is good: I think that the more people who know about something bad, the more likely it is that it will get fixed. But still, it's a downer. So, for a change I thought I'd share a few items of information calculated to lift the spirits. Firstly,  there seems to be good news ahead for all those people, like myself, who can't stand polar bears. Perhaps you find their cubs annoyingly roly-poly, or you think they're too fat-looking - or perhaps you've lost a relative to one of them. Well, help is on the way in the form of man-made climate change. Within thirty years, there'll be no ice at the North Pole in the Summer and the annoyingly pallid bears that live there will be long since extinct. Good riddance to bad bears, I say.","Good news too for anyone who's sick to death of hearing their richer or more adventurous friends go on about how great it is to go scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef. Well, fortunately for us most of the world's reefs are dying even as I write these words.  And not just Australian reefs - soon enough there won't be any anywhere. So stick that in your pipe, irritating holiday show-offs. 

And finally a little bit of humorous news. You know the popular belief that lemmings throw themselves off cliffs? Well it's just not true. They don't commit suicide; it's just that every four years they do pack up and migrate <em>en masse</em>, giving rise to the myth. The funny bit, though, is that they'll all be dead soon too and it's our fault. Humans are heading off a cliff and taking the rest of the world with them and it's the lemmings who get the reputation for being suicidally stupid. Ahh, you've got to laugh, haven't you!","","","","2007-10-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

...today, and, as you'll know if you've been paying attention, I am 33.

33 is a good age because of the fact that there are two of the same digits. Like 22, or 11. Next one will be 44, then 55, 66, 77, 88, 99... er, 111! I hope cybernetic* science makes some big leaps of progress soon.","What was I doing when I was 11? Starting at Big School. I like the bit at the end of Buffy season whatever, when the Principal aka big snakey demon has just been blown up after trying to eat everyone at graduation, and the scooby gang are assembled on the grass bank opposite the smouldering remains of the school. The dialogue goes thus:

Oz: ""Guys. Take a moment to deal with all this. We survived.""
Buffy: ""It was a hell of a battle.""
Oz: ""Not the battle. High school.""

A sentiment that most children can understand, and at age 11 it was all just starting. 

Fast forward to 22. What was I doing then? It was 1996 and I had just graduated with a BA in Archaeology. Ask me anything about archaeology. Go on, ask me. On my birthday I would have been working at Superdrug in the logistics department, on the Kingfisher management development scheme. University was good because I realised for the first time that I was quite bright, compared to the real population - not just the select population of a posh girls' school. So at 22 I was a lot more confident, although with a healthy underpinning of insecurity to encourage me to work really, really hard. I was also really ambitious - how about that - although at that age, I was ambitious for a more usual type of success. ""Senior management within seven to ten years"" was the slogan of the management development scheme that I was on. Well, I did it - but possibly not in the way that they intended. 

And here I am at 33. And I'm pretty pleased with myself. Part-owner of a stunning little business; married to a smashing chap, with two cats; house in the country; robins on the bird table and bunnies on the lawn. What could be better. If only my sprained ankle would get better in time for pounding the halls at Frankfurt next week I would say that life is pretty much perfect. A happy birthday indeed! 

I wonder what I'll be doing when I'm 44?

CD sales are way down. Just thought you should know. It seems that internet downloads to MP3 players are taking a hefty chomp out of the buy-a-disc-at-the-shops market.

The review I just finished reading said that it looks fake - and they meant that in a good way. That's to say you think instead of a screen, someone's stuck a printed label on there instead. But you realise it's not printed paper when the display flips to the next page. It doesn't light up; you read it like a normal book and sunlight doesn't cause it any problems. You can also do other stuff with it like take notes or download new books using its wireless (wi-fi) connection. It's pricey and the software sounds a bit naff, but it's getting there.","What I'd like to see is Irex allowing the hacker community to write their own software for it. That would be <em>sweeeet</em> (as the young folk say). For instance, many of us already use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss"">RSS</a> to gather up our favourite blogs to read. I'd like an Iliad that would store up blog posts using its wifi connection before I left the house. Then I could read news and less worthy stuff on the train. It will display web pages already. Oh, and PDFs, so publishers could easily use it to read PDF versions of submissions and proofs. Maybe someone could write a little bit of software that lets you mark-up mistakes. Or the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/tryit/0,16469,1564647,00.html"">Guardian comes in PDF form</a> if you don't feel like working.

I don't particularly want the paperback market to go digital, but surely a chunk of it will (once Apple makes one of these things). And remember, in a year or two, when we're watching rainforest fires on TV and capital cities keep getting hit by 'freak' floods, we might start to see cutting down trees for a book that takes six hours to read and is then discarded, as being in ecologically poor taste.","","","","2007-10-04","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Under the Ice

As Josh struggles to uncover the mystery surrounding his brother's disappearance on a New Zealand glacier, he reveals a seemingly impossible chain of similar cases tracing back almost a century.","Under the Ice

Theres something down here
1925
Hermitage Hotel
Aoraki/Mount Cook  New Zealand

It was still dark.  The moon was a crescent slip, yet it gave enough light to capture the snow covered peaks of the mountains.  The stars were suspended shoulder to shoulder as they decorated the black sky.  Through the hotel window, Harriet Roseby stared at the silver points of snow and shivered with anticipation and excitement at the thought of climbing into them.  Her eyes travelled down past the peaks and into the heavy moon shadows below them, until she could make out the outline of the valley below.  On the track, which was a lighter strip in the black and grey night, something moved.  Harriet pressed her head onto the glass as she leant forward to try to make it out.  She wondered if her eyes were playing tricks on her, as she watched the shadowy figure making its way towards the valley of shadows that led up to the mountains. It was four oclock in the morning, yet someone was walking out there alone.  She rubbed her eyes to make sure that she wasnt still dreaming and when she opened them, expecting the track to be empty, she had one fleeting glance of the figure before it disappeared out of the light of the moon and into the shadows.
She wrapped her silk dressing gown over her shoulders and shivered with a strange feeling in her stomach that was a mixture of nerves and the adrenalin of being awake when her body clock told her she should be in the deepest sleep of the night.

Harriet was already late by the time she left her room for breakfast.  The rest of the party had almost finished, and a couple were ready to leave the table.  Harriet smiled at her husband, Henry, who had risen to greet her.
Sleeping beauty awakes, he said, as he kissed her cheek.  I thought you had backed out.  Id quite given up hope of you coming along.
And miss my only chance of climbing with you? she replied.
Well if you really are serious about coming along, Henry smiled, then you need to fill up with a good breakfast.
Henry, do you know of any other climbers doing the peaks today?
No, why do you ask?
I just saw someone on the path to the glacier just now.
Yes, you probably did.  Maybe a someone who fancied a night walk or a hunter up for an early dawn shoot.
Probably, Harriet agreed.
As she tried to eat, the image of the shadowy figure crept into her mind and she felt a stir of unease.  She wished she hadnt looked out of the window at that moment, as now she had an idea in her mind that something was waiting for them in that impenetrable darkness.

At <a href=""http://worryfriends.com/"">Leila</a>'s (possibly not very serious) suggestion, I thought I might share with you a few electricity-related stories - including times that I have been electrocuted. Disappointingly, the dictionary insists that electrocution is fatal, so perhaps I've only been slightly electrocuted.","So I used to have a job where I had to get up at about 5:30am to go to work. Always a struggle, as it sometimes takes me a while to wake up. One morning, though, as I was about to make some coffee I noticed that I'd left some laundry in the washing machine from the night before.  The washing machine had a broken catch, so until I could afford to get it fixed I'd taken the top off the machine so I could reach down inside and open the catch from the back. This morning I forgot to turn the power off first. I'm not blaming the manufacturer, but it seems to me that you can never get your arm out of a washing machine as quickly as you'd like in the event of (partial) electrocution. The funny thing, though, was that once I did free myself from the thing, I no longer felt the need for coffee. Nope. I was wiiiide awake. I recommend you try it some time, but make sure you're with friends, as you might need your heart restarting afterwards.

The first time I was ever (partly) electrocuted was when I was very little, but I don't count that. I think I was only about two and so the details are hazy. I remember shortly afterwards various adults impressing upon me the importance of not unscrewing light switches, but that's about it. The next time was at school. Now I did go to one of those expensive traditional schools where they beat pupils for various offenses, but this was an incidental and educational (partial) electrocution rather than a disciplinary one. We were learning about tuning forks in physics class. I was looking for somewhere to stand my tuning fork after I'd struck it and noticed some round holes in the bench. It turns out they were old-fashioned round-pinned electrical sockets from goodness knows how long ago. I remember getting the sense that my whole arm was ringing like a tuning fork, but so loudly that I was surprised the rest of the class didn't look round. After a bit I had the presence of mind to let go. From that day on I possessed the superpower of being quite good at physics -  but it might just have been a Pavlovian response whereby I figured the more I learned, the less likely I was to inadvertently (partially or fully) electrocute myself in class.

After I left school I worked for a while repairing computers. Monitors tend to store charges of several thousand volts and the spark you could get off one was sufficient to take a notch out of a screwdriver. Mains supplies would also store a charge, though at hundreds not thousands of volts. But motherboards operated on five volts and were harmless. So began my interest in computer logic. I knew I'd done the right thing because the number of (partial) electrocutions I received in a week dropped to zero. Bliss.

Just to finish up, I want to make a transatlantic distinction here. UK electricity is at twice the voltage of North America, so if you're empathising with my pain, you should double it for the sake of accuracy. And there's another thing you might not know. While discarded US mains plugs lay on the ground, UK ones stick straight up in the air like caltrops. The pain of stepping on one is a quintessential part of what it means to be British - so much so, I think it should be part of the UK citizenship test.

I have sent 380 emails this week. Two of them were at opposite extremes.","The first was to an author whose book we would like to publish next year. We all love it and we think we can do a really good job of marketing and selling it. It also fits immaculately with our editorial plans. The author wrote a lovely email back saying that he was delighted and it made my heart soar to hear him so happy. I can't wait to crack on with the cover design and all the other things that will get the ball rolling and make someone's dream come true - and delight a lot of readers. 

The second email was to an author whose work we have decided not to publish. Truth be told, we send a lot of these sorts of emails as we get a lot of submissions, but this one was a bit different. It's a great story, and the author's done a great job of developing the ms from its first incarnation to something that is eminently readable, publishable and would no doubt delight many readers. I've read the book three times, now, and have considered it for a long time. But we're not going to publish it. It's just not quite right for us. It doesn't fit as well with our editorial plans as the first book, and when we talked about it we found that rather than entirely agreeing that it was a book for us we had reservations about whether we loved it enough. It's a perfectly brilliant book - but for our tiny team of two readers it just didn't reach our all time favourites list. 

Now think of all the books you've ever read. You liked a lot of them, right? And if one of those books doesn't reach your all time top fifty favourites, that doesn't mean you'd think it a bad book, right? That is the sort of impossible, subjective choice we're talking about. And you'll have had conversations about your all time favourite book with a friend who can't understand why you like it so much. It's a feature of the book market: you can't categorically state that such-and-such a demographic will definitely like a particular book because people's tastes vary, people's opinions are subjective and two similar people can have very different sentiments about a book. I hate most Booker prize winning books. What does that say about my tastes? Am I wrong? Right?

It is so horrible to have to make decisions like this and it's one of the things I hate about fiction publishing and why it has to change. There are readers who would have been delighted with this book if we'd published it. I'm sure that the book will get picked up by another publisher soon, so hopefully those readers will at some point have the opportunity to enjoy it. Just because two people didn't quite love it enough to put &pound;8000 and a year of their working life into it doesn't mean it's not a great book. 

I really hope that in ten, fifteen years time fiction publishing will look a lot different. I hope that the norm will be for authors to publish their work on the web. Readers will have found ways to communicate with each other to share which books they rate and which they don't - through a site like <a href=""http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/"">Rotten Tomatoes</a> or <a href=""http://www.librarything.com/"">Librarything</a>. Readers will be able to order a book for their handheld or via POD and will get it shipped from their online retailer of choice to arrive the next day, or pop into their local high street store who will print a bound copy for them on the <a href=""http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6346866.html"">Espresso machine</a> in the basement. And then fiction publishing will be driven by reader's desires, not by a selection of publishers and agents in their ivory towers deciding what people should and shouldn't read based on personal taste, company strategy and commercial viability.","","","","2007-10-06","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","7"

So, Em and Anna are in Frankfurt now, and I am left in charge of feeding Em's cats. While they were getting themselves from the Flughafen to the Gasthof I was at the Cheltenham Literary Festival listening to an author speak. Having raved about <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/showbook.php?id=0713998997"">her recent book</a>, I was delighted that Naomi Klein had decided to make her way from Canada to the Cotswolds so that I could hear what she had to say in person.","It was, of course, fascinating. Ms. Klein is a very good speaker and, whenever she extemporises, she's very funny too. Afterwards, there was a long, long line in the Waterstone's tent where she was signing books. I thought about joining it, wondering if I was the sort of person who values a signed copy more than an unsigned one, and if so why. I mean, a personal message from an author you know is one thing; a signature from someone who only laid eyes on you four seconds previously is... less good. But then I spied her husband and realised that I was the only one who knew who he was. So instead of queueing I had a wonderful (for me that is) chat to him about his documentary <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Take-Naomi-Klein/dp/B000CCD1X4/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-6264262-7593632?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1192001445&sr=8-1"">The Take</a> and how in many ways it complimented his wife's writing. 

On the drive home I was thinking about the book, once more determined to tell people about it, to try to persuade them to read it, and at the same time aware that most people aren't interested, don't want to know and don't want me trying to nag, wheedle and plead with them to change their views. I want to persuade people, but I don't want to seem like a nut or a creepy zealot. And then I realised something: this must be a little taste of how proselytising Christians feel. They've got their favourite book, they want to change the world for the better with it - in fact they think it contains vital information everyone should be aware of. But Brits don't like people who believe anything too fervently, it doesn't matter what it is - and I include myself in that too. I know I don't want anyone talking to me about the bible because I already know it's not my sort of thing, that I don't believe 'all that stuff', even before I hear it. The difference is that I consider information about what's going on in the world genuinely important and old scriptures irrelevant - but then I would say that because I 'believe' in one and not the other.

I don't know what the answer to this is. Perhaps the parallels with Christianity end there, because a big part of the problem, I think, is with the medium. I talked to Avi Lewis (Naomi Klein's husband) about how books just don't reach most people. There are plenty of people who will watch a documentary on TV who won't read a four-hundred-page book, however good the book is. The tricky question is how to reach the remaining majority who won't watch a documentary either. The thing that gave me considerable hope was hearing that Alfonso Cuaron, who made Children of Men, and the third Harry Potter movie, wants to get involved in turning Naomi's book into a movie. Perhaps, if it's a really, really good movie it will reach enough people that its revelations become common knowledge. It wouldn't need to be as well known as the bible, just say as well known as Harry Potter. Is that asking too much? 

<hr/>

Just to remind everyone, here's my quick summary:

<p style=""color: blue;"">The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein</p>

We're all in favour of capitalism, but it comes in different flavours. In Britain, we take for granted all sorts of socialist 'safety nets', like subsidised health care, state pensions, disability benefits, a minimum wage, unemployment benefit and fuel subsidies for the poor. But there are many influential people who believe that all the things in that list must be abolished to make way for a pure 'free market' - and while they struggle to get their way in places like Britain and America, they have more success in poorer countries - often acting in our name.

For instance, when the IMF makes a loan to a poor country, they'll usually insist that the government stops giving cheap food to people who are starving. They'll insist, for instance, that water companies should be privatised, even if it means a section of the population can't afford water. They want capitalism without all the soft edges we take for granted. That benefits Western investors, Western businesses and allows Western governments to exert political pressure; it usually does so at the expense of the local people. And that's the face of the West that many in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe see. There is a rush to privatise everything and, like Russia after the fall of the wall, a few investors grab everything leaving the majority worse off. (Except that Russia was unusual: there local 'oligarchs' grabbed everything; normally it's foreigners who end up owning everything worth having.)

And now that trend is coming to the West. America is privatising war, disaster relief, prisons, policing - even torture. And every time there's a disaster - a terrorist attack, a war, a hurricane, a flood - it's an opportunity to hand out more private contracts and to rush through more legislation to limit what ordinary people can do and to expand what corporations are allowed to take on. There are forty-thousand mercenaries in Iraq, working for companies like Blackwater. And these days, so many companies make money from spying, security and 'reconstruction' that the stock market goes up when there's a disaster.

Free-market capitalism with no restraints may be good for 'the economy' as a whole, but that's just another way of saying that the super-rich make so much money it outweighs the losses of everyone else in the country. That's not what most people want and the only way it's allowed to happen is because most people don't know about it. That's why the book is important.

...we're doing more of it. After the fact, it's easy to come up with reasons for that - reasons that sound a bit like strategy. For instance, we're planning to do more <em>non</em>-fiction because it's easier to assess the demand for a title like City Cycling than it is for a general fiction title. And you could say the same about genre fiction. If your target readership already know what they want, then it's a lot easier to give it to them. Whereas trying to titillate the jaded palates of the general fiction reader can - in the nicest possible way - be a little like trying to tempt a grumpy child (or cat*) to eat something. Moreover, 'general fiction' can be a dumping ground for everything that doesn't fit into an established niche, and that makes for a pretty big and disorganised category. The size of the general fiction section makes for tons of direct competition and its use as a catch-all makes it a challenge for the reader to navigate. Arranging authors alphabetically offers no help whatsoever if you don't already have an author in mind - it's just that no obviously superior arrangement suggests itself.","So there you go, that's the post-rationalisation. Snowbooks is finding genre fiction titles more and more to its liking and the reasons just mentioned explain why. Except that they don't. Those are the reasons for being happy with our genre selections; the reason we made them in the first place is this: great storytelling transcends genre.

I would never have expected Anna to get excited about horror titles. She's Snowbooks' only proper English graduate (past or present) and you know how picky <em>they</em> can be about the books they read. Chances are you're one too, so you know what I mean. Studying English at university (I will hereby claim) is more likely to make a person snobby towards horror than disposed to it. And I've never noticed a horror title on Anna's bookshelves. (Well, perhaps there's a Stephen King novel somewhere, but they sprout up all by themselves.) But the fact is, when you get a really good submission, one that you can't believe you're getting paid to read, genre doesn't matter. 

For instance when I think about TV I like, I remember finding the fact that The West Wing was about politicians and civil servants a giant turn-off. When the series began, I had no interest in that stuff; it utterly bored me. But the quality of the show won me over as soon as I tried watching it. Likewise I thought the fact that the X-Files established the dramatic truth behind half-baked myths and conspiracy theories as being much more a drawback than a draw. Shows about vampires are always awful (except for the excellent Buffy). And the idea of space cowboys is appalling (but Firefly was wonderful).

So I'm going to continue to work on our strategy by coming up with good reasons to do what we wanted to do anyway. Currently, we're entering a period of apocalypse and the undead.

*While Em was explaining to me how to look after her cats (while she's in Frankfurt) she informed me that they often won't want the first thing you put out for them, even if it's ordinarily one of their favourite foods.

When I moved to the countryside, Em lent me her book of animals tracks and signs so that I could figure out what sort of critters were visiting my garden. I'm a big fan of Ray Mears and was delighted to have one of his books to refer to. Click on the thumbnail and take a look at the cover. There's Ray, and there's his name in bold. But look closely and you'll discover something that it took me more than a week to notice. There are a couple of other names on the cover, in much smaller letters than Ray's name, and they are... the authors. When you see a book with Ray Mear's picture on the cover, it's about tracking and his name is by far the largest on the page, you assume he wrote it. Well I did anyway.","Whether OUP have crossed some sort of line here I'm not sure, but the question is relevant to the cover design Snowbooks does. We regularly make books look slightly reminiscent of other similar-styled works. And it's not because we want to pass them off as something they're not; it's visual shorthand to say this book is similar to the more famous works it looks like. In other words, we're visually conveying a genuine similarity - which seems honest to me. But if we thought someone <em>might actually mistake</em> our book for some bestseller it partly resembles, we'd back off. We're not interested in publishing Don Brown's <em>The Leonardo Code</em>. But then again, I'm sure Oxford University Press aren't in that game either. But whether they intended it or not, that's what they achieved with the book above - at least with me. What do you think? Have they been a bit naughty or am I just not terribly observant?","","","","2007-10-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

OK. I think I may have cracked it. I've been trying to figure out ways to persuade people to read Naomi Klein's <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/showbook.php?id=0713998997"">The Shock Doctrine</a> and it's not been easy. How best to win people over? Well I think I've finally hit upon a plan that could work for as many as 30% of the book-reading population - nearly all of them women. So, Ladies, you're nicely brought up, you read a lot, maybe you work in publishing - so when it comes to lusting after Hollywood pin-ups do you go with the crowd and choose Brad Pitt or some similar chunk of beefcake, or do you demand a little bit more? Do you instead favour John Cusack? He's smart, he's funny and he has good taste. If he met you, he'd probably like you, right? Oh, but there's a problem. Check out the YouTube video below and you'll see what I mean.","<object width=""425"" height=""350""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/WsNTSpiwXN4""></param><param name=""wmode"" value=""transparent""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/WsNTSpiwXN4"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" width=""425"" height=""350""></embed></object>

You're having dinner, maybe at John's place - he cooked, and it was delicious - and you're chatting about this and that and you get onto politics. And then he says excitedly, ""Have you read Naomi Klein's latest book?"" And you say, ""Well, it's not really my thing."" He says ""OK"" in a slightly non-committal way and the conversation moves on, but it's not quite the same after that. You sense you've somehow disappointed him. You and he might be friends, but you're never going to be soul mates because you care about different things. You head home that night having had a lovely evening but feeling that somehow you've let a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity slip by. And all it would have taken was a few hours of your time and 15. Ah well...

So am I getting close? Or am I still not persuading anyone?","","","","2007-10-13","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Nothing to do with books, but do you ever find yourself fuzzily recollecting that San Francisco is on a major geological fault? Something stirs up a memory from a textbook or an old documentary and you think to yourself, ""Oh yes, that's right. They're due a giant earthquake some day soon, aren't they?""","By way of contrast, I've been talking to my builder and various insurance-related people about finally getting the post-flood repairs done on my place. There's not much damage but it's taken a long time to even get the work planned. The guys I talk to have been kept very busy not just because of repair work, but because people in the neighbourhood are spending oodles of cash on preventive measures for 'next time'. Now I can quite see their point, climate change, erratic weather, etc; But is it really likely that we'll have another record flood any time soon and that it will strike this part of the country? Isn't it likely it will be a different weather phenomenon hitting somewhere else? Aren't we just as likely to get a drought next or an extra-cold winter or a little tornado? I'm not convinced that people are prioritising according to the likelihood of a particular disaster, but rather on how easy it is to picture. And floods are easy to picture because the images are still fresh in our minds. 

But perhaps having your city destroyed feels far fetched, no matter how scientifically likely it is, when all you see around you is normality. I've been to San Francisco a couple of times and I very much liked the place. The chilly, foggy mornings give it a sense of old world reality that Southern California lacks. The place just seems a lot more established than L.A. which gives the impression that it could all have been built since the Seventies. But unless I've misunderstood the geology of the area, it's going to be knocked flat by a massive earthquake in the next few years. 

Now, following Katrina, we know that F.E.M.A. aren't worth a damn these days. And since the I-35W bridge collapse we've learned that bridges, roads and general infrastructure all over the States are in need of considerable renovation. Hold that in your head and it seems a little surreal that people are living on top of a fault line. Perhaps they believe the quake will destroy <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault#The_University_of_California_study_on_.22the_next_big_one.22"">Palm Springs</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault#The_University_of_California_study_on_.22the_next_big_one.22"">San Bernardino</a> instead. Whereas the residents of those cities are betting that S.F. will take the brunt. Or maybe the gamble is that it will never happen at all.

I hope the whole thing isn't a microcosm for how we're going to react to global climate change: do nothing until we can look out of our windows and see the catastrophe with our own eyes.","","","","2007-10-13","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Carole Cadwalladr has written a bleak and damning and rather nice little <a href=""http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2190468,00.html"">article</a> in Guardian Unlimited today about the howling soulless wastes of the Frankfurt Book Fair. I have to say, when she reiterates how few publishers accept manuscripts unless they come from an agent, and then explains that most agents don't accept unsolicited manuscripts either, it does give you momentary doubts about the efficiency and openness of our industry.","But then regular readers will know that I'm always suggesting ways of replacing us with something that works better for authors and readers. My favourite of late would be to junk much of the author->agent->publisher->retailer->reader filtering process and replaced it with some sort of reader-reviewed rating system. Our book choices could then be based on the recommendations of the readers one tier more adventurous than ourselves, who are willing to read and rate untested writing. Combine that with the technology of something akin to <a href=""http://www.pandora.com/"">Pandora</a> (which is still doing me proud since commenter John gave me the final nudge I needed to try it) and you'd really have something. I suppose one's enthusiasm for such an idea might well depend on the extent to which one sees publishing/book retailing as being in need of saving. I tend to think there's too much infighting and not enough innovation - and I don't mean just novelty, I mean real paradigmatically-vertiginous innovation not so much in the writing of the words as in the selection, marketing and delivery of them. 

At any rate, welcome back recent Frankfurters! I have laid in the fixings for tasty cream teas for Em and Anna. Hopefully your support staff will have done something similar for you.

<br/><hr/><br/>

<em>Tangential Addendumy-thing:</em> I just noticed that I have Carole Cadwalladr's novel on my shelf. As yet unread. I bought it because I enjoyed her articles. And reading the one referred to above made me think I should pick it up once more. But then I remembered what had stopped me getting past the first page last time. It wasn't a fault in the writing, it was realising that what reading her articles <em>really</em> made me want to do was read <em>more</em> of her articles. But perhaps I should give the novel a go as well.","","","","2007-10-14","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

of returns. I am seriously furious about them today - because of the sheer, utter, bloody wastefulness and stupidity of this industry to still be operating in such a mindless, thoughtless, incompetent way. It's SO RETARDED to print thousands of books, send them on a lorry somewhere, let them sit unboxed in the back room, send them back, pulp them, raise a credit note, publisher doesn't get paid.","Not only does the publisher not get paid: the publisher has spent the following money: 
Cost of print
Cost of shipping from printer
Cost of storage
Cost of shipping to retailer
Cost of pulping (3% of net receipts) or
Cost of putting back into stock (9% of net receipts)
Cost of having a high returns profile (distributor uses that as a way of assigning 'unidentified credit notes'. Who knows why they are unidentified - because of the genius Industry Returns Initiative, maybe, that only aims to automate, rather than reduce, returns?)
Cost of paying the royalty to authors based on a sales figure which slips backwards

If it wouldn't spell the end of my company, I would switch - today - to firm sale only. But it would. No one would buy books in any quantity from us - because they're unable to forecast stock, because they've never had to learn and because their ranges are so wide. 

Damn, it makes me mad. Stupid, stupid publishing industry.

Alison Bacon left it until she was fifty to set about her ambition of writing a novel. 'Her Father's Daughter' is her second attempt. Her next ambition is to get published!

Who can save Ailsa, as her search for the truth about her father becomes a road to self-destruction?","Her Father's Daughter
 
[My Mum keeps secrets and hurts people. She hurts me every morning when she tugs the hair off my face to make sure every strand's caught in the thick plait I wear to school. She hurts the ladies who come to the door then go into our front room where the curtain's are always drawn and there's a hot sweet smell. Sometimes the ladies laugh and Mum laughs with them, but other times they say 'Ouch!' loud enough for me to hear, so I know they are hurting too. 
 I think Mum hurts but in a different way, a hurt that comes from inside, and this hurt is because of my Dad. When I was four he went away and my Gran and my Auntie Moira came round together and sat in our living room and Gran said,  'Away and put the kettle on, Ailsa, we need a cup.' 
 And I did, though I'd only just learned how to warm the pot and make sure the water was boiling. Because there were visitors I used cups and saucers instead of mugs, and carried them in on a tray, really slowly, though the slower I went the more they seemed to wobble. 
The talking stopped again when I got to the door. 
 'Yer a good girl, Ailsa,' Gran said. 
 I kept looking at the tea slopping from side to side, nearer and nearer to the rim of the cups, but it didn't spill over, not quite. 
 'You'll look after yer Mum, now, won't ye?'  Gran said. 
 That's when I knew my Dad wasn't coming back. 
 
Now Laura Patterson from school has invited me to tea.  We play with her Barbie dolls and have sausages that taste funny. I eat them to be polite but they leave a taste of sick in my mouth. After tea we watch a video and Laura 's Dad comes in the sitting room. His name is Andy and Laura says he's not her Dad, because her Dad left and went to live in London. I say my Dad left too and Laura asks if he sends me stuff at Christmas like hers does, and I say no. Laura says my Dad probably sends money to my Mum. They have to send money. It's the law.  
After that my tummy hurts and I ask to go to the toilet and then I sick up the sausages and Laura's Mum phones my Mum and says she'd better come to take me home.  
 When I'm ready for bed, Mum sits me on her knee and asks me if my tummy's better. I say yes, and she says it was probably the excitement of going to Laura's. 
 'Laura goes to see her Dad in the holidays,' I tell her. 
 Mum's undoing my plait but when she gets to a tuggy bit she untangles it without hurting. 'You're Dad won't come back. Ailsa, and you can't go to see him.'
 'Why?'
 'He's not in our family. Not any more.'
 'Is he in someone else's family?'
 'No. I don't think so. He was never really a family man.'
Next time Laura Patterson asks me about him I say Dad's gone somewhere I can't go to visit.
 'You mean he's died?' says Laura.
 And I say, 'Yeh, that's right. He left us, then he died.']

So I've been asked to give a talk on blogs. Some really nice people who are running a seminar called 'Reaching Readers Online' have very sweetly said that the Snowblog is quite good, and the other online things we do are quite good too, and so have invited me to talk at it. 

It being a talk on blogging, and me having a blog, I thought I'd get a bit fancy. I'm using this blog entry as a way to present the things I'd like to get across. What can possibly go wrong with that, writing (or at least, posting - I'm not typing this live, or that really would be a very dull talk) a blog post in front of an audience of 40-odd, in a hotel where the internet connection is bound to not work when I need it to, when I am completely unable to multitask so can only write or speak at one time - not both? Well, we'll see, won't we? 

//update - yup, the internet connection kept failing! Ah, the modern world. Hotels haven't joined it yet.//","Those people who read this blog know what the usual fare is. Rob (who's Snowbooks' chairman) and I ramble on about things that we think. In the last month we've had Rob's <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/robs_theory_of_linguistic_dive.html"">theory</a> of linguistic divergence, Leila's home <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/coming_soon.html"">videos</a>, <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/snowcase_18.html"">Snowcases</a>, <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/a_lovely_review.html"">reviews</a>, why I'm <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/what_i_do_when_im_not_publishi.html"">learning Java</a> through the OU, my<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/sorted.html""> tips</a> on duotones, thoughts on why publishers still have <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/imprints_1.html"">imprints</a>, an interlude when I used the blog to tell<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/abusing_the_blog.html""> someone</a> their emails were bouncing, book <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/don_tapscott_and_anthony_willi.html"">reviews</a> of sorts, reports from <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/our_day_out_in_pictures.html"">day trips</a>, the launch of <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/snowvon_calling.html"">Snowvon</a>, a tutorial for getting Word 2007 to process XML, repeated posts about <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/incentives.html"">Naomi </a>Klein's new book, blog<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/earths_underside.html""> reviews,</a> the launch of our <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/christmas_homepage.html"">Christmas</a> range, notices about Steve Aylett's next <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/aylett_gig.html"">gig</a>, and I've just looked and that's only two weeks in September and I'm bored of listing all these so just go to the archives and see for yourself. 

What does it all add up to? A conversation? Sort of - if it is, it's a conversation that we're dominating. It's more of an informal speech. Rob and I say things that we want to, and then take a few points and questions from the floor (via comments). Given the number of people who say to me 'ooh, I read your blog' who have never commented, it shows it's a very one-sided conversation. We're not using the blog as a forum to replace real life conversation: it doesn't allow for a balanced chat with our readers. We're using it as a real time, unfiltered, authentic description of what's happening at Snowbooks. 

Ah! Authentic, you say? Yes - the snowblog can be authentic because, frankly, there are three of us in the company, with very similar views on things, and so the voice we speak with is our own. No great trick to it. But it's a problem for large companies - blogging is really at the level of the individual and it's pretty difficult for one person to speak authentically on behalf of thousands. Even smaller companies get it wrong, though. Updating only weekly, speaking in that stifling, airbrushed corporatespeak - cardinal sins. Who wants to read what amounts to an out of date press release? 

Speaking of readers, who exactly are the readers of the SnowBlog? Hello? You out there? Who are you? Are you fans of the business? Members of the publishing industry, eager for insight? Spies? Book lovers? Indie publisher supporters? Journalists? I bet the vast majority of you work in or around publishing - and I bet a minority have actually bought our books. (Yes, this is a guilt trip. Yes, you should immediately go to the <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/shop.html"">Snowshop</a> and stock up.) So this blog isn't a particularly good way of 'reaching readers' - because who cares which publisher published your favourite book? Publisher brands only matter within the industry. You don't go into store and ask for the latest Transworld, you ask for the latest Dan Brown. 

OK, now we're getting somewhere. If it's author brands that readers are interested in then blogging by authors is probably a good thing? Yes, why not. We have some particularly fine blogs run by our authors: the most inventive is actually a <a href=""http://www.plottingforbeginners.com/pfb/"">blog by Sally Howe</a>, the fictional heroine of <a href=""http://snowbooks.com/web9781905005123.html"">Plotting for Beginners</a>.  

So author brands can be helped by blogging. But is one blog alone powerful enough, or is the trick to integrate yourself with the wider community? One of our finest online successes came from the community itself. We publish a book called <a href=""http://snowbooks.com/web9781905005178.html"">The Crafter's Companion</a> - a collection of pieces from some of the leading crafting bloggers in which they describe their inspiration, passions, workspaces and provide a little pattern of one of the projects they've created. It's a beautiful, inspiring book - but more importantly it's a collection by the people, for the people. The online crafting community is astoundingly buoyant - heaps of crafters post about their creations and get wonderful feedback and support from their fellow bloggers. And sure enough, when this book came out almost every crafting blog mentioned it. There is such unbridled, genuine enthusiasm for this book and it's a source of great pride that we've created it - but there's a commercial element to this, too. When it was published this time last year, its editor created a little paypal button for pre-orders, and popped it on her own crafting blog. She made it available to anyone else who wanted to put it on their blog. Then we went away to Frankfurt for 5 days. When we got back, we had $5000 of pre-orders - just from a <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2006/10/button_button_whos_got_the_but.html"">little button</a>! 

<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/thecrafterscompanion/""><img src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/ccbuynow.jpg""></a>

To bring talk of communities back to the SnowBlog, we blog because we enjoy it. We have things to say, things we want to share, we have a company that we're insanely in love with and proud of and blogging is an outlet for that passion. And if people enjoy reading about what we do, then that's smashing. But we're not blogging as a clever, clearly-thought-through way of selling books. We also didn't sit down and think, right, must do online things so as to be clever and modern. I like computers, and I like spending most of my working day in front of one, and I like words, so it's no wonder, really, that I like blogging. But we never started it to boost sales or get rich. 

But you never know how these things work out. Hey, I'm standing in front of an audience right now, talking about this, because we've built up a degree of credibility through our commitment to blogging. In a minute I'm going to mention that Snowbooks does cover and layout design for other publishers, and they're bloody good and excellent value, and we can also advise and build online stuff for other companies, so who knows, someone in the audience might <a href=""mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"">get in touch</a> later, cheque book in hand. Blogging has an effect a little bit like Frankfurt - the real reason we go is for the serendipity, the chance meetings, the conversations that lead to tremendous insights and new ventures (and boy, did we have some of those). 

So, in summary: you won't get rich quick, but blogging is a way to establish a voice, to break through the airbrushed corporatespeak of brochures and press releases. And, done well, blogs that are part of a community are a trustworthy way for people to find books they are interested in.

And that is the end of my speech. (Rapturous applause, roses thrown at feet, calls of 'more! more!', young men rushing to airkiss their congratulations, etc) No, please. You're too kind. Thank you, thank you.","","","","2007-10-18","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

Here are some of the questions, and my rough responses, from the blogging chat yesterday","Q: How did you get started with blogging? 

A: I gravitate towards free stuff  and after starting Snowbooks I surprised myself by turning into a bit of a geek. Suddenly, when it was my own money on the line the idea of reading IT manuals and googling techie forums was much more appealing than paying someone to do it for me. Plus Snowbooks is our own creation to nurture and be proud of  - or ashamed of if we do things wrong. It seemed very important to be the one in control of the voice of the company. Plus we always like being first with things, or at least early adopters. Its delicious fun to know that we are doing things years ahead of other companies, with more money and time than us. For reasons of cost and control, then, blogging seemed from the start like our natural habitat! 

 
Q: What can a firm like yours get from blogging as a communication channel?

A: The publishing process is linear; it's not a feedback loop. An author comes up with a book (usually); an agent buys it and presses it onto  a publisher, who in turn sells it to a retailer. The customer  the reader  eventually stumbles across it on the 3for2 tables (the browser buying model) or sees a review/hears good things and buys it (the searcher model). But there is precious little feedback after that to the producers. Amazon reviews dont number sufficiently highly to be statistically significant; publishers dont do much test marketing or anything like the research Procter and Gamble, for instance, do. All publishers know is that they have the readers money  they have no idea if the reader ever read the book, or gave it as a gift, or loved it, or hated it.  What a blog can do is provide one way for that linear chain to turn into a feedback loop. By taking the frankly rather brave step of enabling comments, you allow people to say precisely what they think. Scary  but utterly invaluable. 

Q: How do you find your voice? What is it to be authentic?

A: Isnt it sad that being authentic is special? After all, its just being human. I think the trick is at the recruitment stage. Only hire people who you are 100% confident in. Then let them say whatever the hell they like  and when they screw up, dont yell at them. Again, brave  but the alternative is the air-brushed corporatespeak which will do *far* more harm and open you up to derision from your readers. People like to be proud of what they do: let them talk about it. Let them own their bit of the company. 

Q: Practicalities: How long do you and the team spend? 

A: About a half hour to an hour a day. Seems like a long time, and it is  but this is the essence of the company were talking about here. After four years of blogging, we have a lot of readers  every event I go to, someone new comes up and says ooh, I read your blog. Everything we are is epitomised by the blog, and frankly Id rather find ways to automate the boring stuff that no-one sees so I have time to do important stuff like projecting our companys progressive brand. Put in place the fixings for automation  like ONIX compliance, automatic field-fillers for sales spreadsheets and marketing materials, upgrade to a decent, simple bookkeeping system  and you have time enough for blogging. (Although I am about a month behind on my bookkeeping at the moment. Erg.)

Q: What does the idea of 'being brave' really mean in using the web in book marketing?

A: You dont need to be brave if youve got no secrets. So, ditch the secrets. Go as far back up the supply chain as it goes and be absolutely certain that you are doing the best you can, creating the best books, working with the best processes that youre perfectly proud of. So you have an amazing plan for next year? Who cares if your main competitor finds out  the trick is in the execution, not the idea. Snowbooks business model is incredible traditional  nothing unique at all  but its how we execute that model that is the trick. So dont be afraid of people getting hold of secrets, because no one cares. 

If you discover things that your company should keep secret, that youre ashamed of, then REMOVE THEM! So it turns out a range of business books you publish are actually quite crap, and youre only publishing them because of a sponsorship deal? Well, Id suggest thats something you should rectify. Readers are quite possibly buying them and hurling them against the wall in disgust  thats something that needs fixing. 

Q: Is there a particular challenge that large corporates face? You guys are racing away with digital channels much faster than those with much much larger organisation?

A: Authentic conversations are at the individual level. Companies  groups of people  find it hard to find a unified, consistent voice, precisely because theyre part of an internal conversation. My advice? Find someone in the organisation whose views exemplify the organisations own, and let them speak. Ideally, it should be the most senior manager. Isnt it interesting that were talking about blogging here, but the real problems are organisational and strategic? 

Q: Show me the money: how much money does your blog make? 

A: In direct sales, about 50 a month. In brand awareness, about 100k a year (related to column inches in The Bookseller and their equivalent ad rate)

Q: Can you come into my company and help me? 

A: Yes, we are a small publisher, and therefore cash-starved, so any money youd like to pay me to help you with your own web presence would be most welcome! Snowbooks also do cover design for other publishers and were as good at that as we are at this stuff! 
 
Q: You have non-publishing things on your blog  I even saw a photo of your cats. Surely you have to focus, stay on message? 

A: Humans have wide ranging interests. Our blog covers politics, my cats, books, blogs, the book industry, what I had for lunch  because Im a rounded individual with a lot of aspects to my life. Dont try and force authenticity  instead, be you and its inevitable.","","","","2007-10-19","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

Congrats to Matthew De Abaitua. Last night was the launch party for <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005581.html"">The Red Men</a> and it all went very well. In attendance were lots of writers and journalists, all of them passionate readers. Plus I met a couple of slightly crazy girls (who were nevertheless fascinating company) and learned a considerable amount about the art of film direction and the pitfalls of the modern novel as a result. Then Matthew read a little of the book to the grateful throng. And we weren't just paying attention because Matthew had chosen a smutty bit either - smutty but full of literary merit I'd like to stress.

Now looking back on it, I can't imagine why I didn't have a camera with me so that you'all could see what went on. But then again I don't really leave the house that much, never mind haunt urban dens of literary iniquity and hard liquor, and I think I must have been too startled by the bright lights to remember my duty to the SnowBlog readership. Next time though I'll make sure I get some incriminating negatives for our files.","","","","","2007-10-19","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Amazing what a good night's sleep can do. I have felt wretched - sick, shaky, emotional, fuzzy - all week because last weekend we were still in Frankfurt, and it's been one long unending week since then. And then there was a week's worth of emails to deal with, plus the follow up from Frankfurt, plus a few deadlines for prizes and so forth that needed doing urgently, plus a few meetings that overran massively... it all added up to a bit of an ordeal. 

But falling asleep at 8pm and waking up at 9.30am seems to have put it all into perspective. And so, to the dramatic declaration: I am going to have the weekend off. I figure I need a bit of a break. So forgive me if I haven't replied to your email yet; forgive me if there were things I've promised to do by Monday; forgive me if I don't reply to future emails promptly. I'm going to go for a walk to Rousham now, and then Andy and I are going to make soup. I'm going to play with the cats, and see if I can build a shelter for the hedgehogs I saw last week. I may scuff some leaves. I am not going to check emails; I'm not going to check sales figures; I'm not going to blog; I'm Officially Having A Break.

I have something to add to Em's suggestions regarding prudent bloglore. In fact it's the main function I perform at Snowbooks. Make sure your blog posts include pictures. I have to confess, though, that it's Anna's rule; I just enact it.","","","","","2007-10-20","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

It's been a lot more difficult to sell books this year than last year. The only consolation - if it is a consolation - for what seems like a backward step for us is that everyone else seems to be having a tough time at the moment too. At least among those we speak to, returns are waaaay up.

So every now and again I tease Em about how difficult publishing is and suggest that we both might like to return to our previous jobs where we made tons of money without any real responsibility towards the companies we worked for.","Shorter hours, a lot more cash and at the end of the day we could just switch off because it was someone else's business (though somehow switching off never seemed that easy). And once I've suggested it, Em and I usually share a collective shudder at the thought. Neither of us much liked the people we used to have to pretend to be in order that our bosses would give us good appraisals. To illustrate: in various annual reviews over the years I've been told to smile less, to change the people I sit with at lunch, to make sure I stay for after-work drinks, to find more indirect ways to tell people that I disagree with them (though god knows I'm hardly blunt) - and then to find a different way to be indirect because my current indirectness seemed patronising. And bear in mind that both Em and I were always goody-goodies, trying hard to do what was asked of us. We used to put a lot of effort into suppressing our natural personalities so we could replace them with something that our bosses liked better. 

A big part of starting Snowbooks was to let Em and I figure out how to be more who we are with each passing year, not less. We reckoned if we could only succeed by pretending to be someone else then we probably wouldn't find our success very satisfying. I'm not sure how much money a company would have to pay us to go back to the corporate playacting where our real selves weren't considered good enough but it would be a vast sum.

So to anyone out there weighing up money versus doing what you want to do with your life, can I recommend the latter. In the UK at least, it's difficult to starve; it's not difficult to be unhappy.","","","","2007-10-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

CHAPTER ONE
 
   I never objected to being cut in half. Didnt bother me. Disappearing into a tacky lacquered wardrobe I could handle, too. Even being strapped to a giant target and having knives thrown at me was all right, once I got used to it. But dressing up as a Bird of Paradise and having my tail feathers set on fire was a step too far. A girl has to draw the line somewhere, and thats where I drew it. Above my tail feathers.

  Paying your dues, the Ringmaster told me. Everyone has to do it, he said. Not flamb feathers necessarily, but stuff like that, on the way to what they really wanted.

  Dues is one thing, I told him, a barbequed bum is another.

  Of course he didnt like being said no to. What man does? But it was late in the season, ticket sales were down, and I was the pick of a poor bunch. He knew he couldnt afford to piss me off completely. I knew it too. When youre seventeen you know everything.

  Now Im thirty-one and I wonder what happened to that ballsy young woman. Here I am, sitting on a damp, empty, sunless beach in Cornwall because I cant think what else to do. Thats exactly how my life feels right now; damp, empty, and sunless. Thank you, Gavin. And thank you, Water Wings Ltd. First my husband dumps me for a younger woman, then three days later my boss does the same. Not that anybodys admitting thats whats happened. Gavin says he fell in love, didnt mean it to happen, and couldnt help himself. Bollocks to that. Love my arse. Lust is more like it. If he doesnt like women with small boobs why did he marry one? At work I was told the department was being downsized and my job didnt exist any more. Funny how perky little Savannah is now doing exactly what I used to do, only with a different job title. Even more bloody hilarious that she turns out to be the bosss new squeeze. As if all that wasnt bad enough Gavins being a prat about selling the flat, and Ive been done out of any redundancy pay by being offered relocation. Sorry, but I just dont fancy Milton Keynes. I ask you, its enough to make any girl wonder where she went wrong, isnt it?

  Any girl except Laura, that is. 

  This is ridiculous, Xanthe, she tells me, Theres no-one here, Im cold, Im wet from this sea sodding mist were sitting in, and if I dont find a loo soon Ill be even wetter. What is the bloody point of all this soul searching and navel gazing?

  I have to at least have a stab at working out where I screwed up, I say.

You had one feckless jerk for a husband and another one for a boss. Simple. Mystery solved. Can we please go home now?

Samantha Tonge still chuckles at the memory of her first book. She chuckles at her second - Moon in Taurus  but hopefully for the right reasons. It is a romantic comedy.
 
Charley is suffering from Emperors New Clothes Disorder  the signs are all there, she IS in love Will she see the truth before Miles departs?","Moon in Taurus

  A charcoaled tuft of lace fluttered into the air. Charley watched as it rose high on the breeze and slow-danced in front of the moon, before dipping down over the fence and into next doors garden. She pulled a tartan blanket tighter around her shoulders and prodded the embers of the bonfire with an old bamboo stick she had found in the shed.  How shed loved her wedding dress, with its beaded trim and embroidered bodice. And how cathartic it had been to ignite it, with all the flourish of lighting a birthday cake.
  She leant back into the deckchair and shoved another Jaffa Cake into her mouth  well why not, if they were deemed healthy enough for the England football squad. And it had been hard work, ripping at the tailored sleeves and yanking out the petticoat. Until at midnight, her task complete, shed sat back and watched a flurry of red, blue and silver sparks see in the New Year  warmed by the barbeque that was her dress. 
 A door slammed and eventually the tap-tap of heels crossed the kitchen tiles. A slight figure, wearing a Parka, appeared at the open back door.
  Mum?                                                                                                                                  
  Out here, Tammy, Charley called, staring in disbelief at the remnants of white silk. Yet how could she regret something that had felt so good? She should have torn up that dress long ago.
  Tamsin traipsed across the lawn and stopped, looking from her mother towards the fire and then back to her mother again. 
  What you doing?
  Happy New Year, darling! God, it was hard to sound cheerful. You look as if youve had a good time at Hannahs.
  Tamsin swayed a little as she bent down over the embers.
  Burning old clothes? she said, squinting as the smoke wafted into her eyes. Isnt that illegal or something? Then she spotted an ivory storage box, upside down in a puddle by some Japonica bushes. Mum! Are you mad? Not your wedding dress?
  Charley continued to prod the embers.
  Your wedding dress? repeated Tamsin, shaking her head as she sat down onto the grass near her mother. She rested her elbows on her raised knees. But why? Thought you were keeping it for me?
  I seem to remember last time I got it out you swore youd never wear that hideous Bo-Peep monstrosity.
  Couldve customized it. Tamsin pursed her lips. When are you going to get over the whole Dad and Beanie thing?
  Charley opened her mouth before quickly closing it again. She should have been used to teenage directness by now.  As she stood up to go in, a cleanly folded letter fell from her lap.
  Whats this? Tamsin picked it up.
  Oh, nothing, I
  But it was too late. Tamsin had already unfolded it and stopped reading after the first two words: Decree Absolute. Charley took back the letter and smiled a little too brightly.

"41233","","1","Frankfurt report","Publish","true","So I have bided (bid? bod?) my time in reporting our news from Frankfurt until I had firm things to say. Lots of follow up is still being done, so doubtless more things will be reported on as we go, but here are the main things so far. Guess what's going on here?

<img alt=""3bd.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/3bd.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""379"" />","Only the start of another groundbreaking Snowbooks Frankfurt Song! Yup, the occasion above marked the point at which Anna and I spontaneously penned the following lyrics:

Three book deal
Three book deal
La, la-la
La, la-la 
Three book deal! 

The tune is hard to describe. For those of you who can read music, in four four time, first two lines are all crotchets, G, E, C (rest) / D, B, G (rest)  then crotchet quaver quaver for the next two lines A, B, C /B, C, D then all crotchets C, E, G. Da capo al fine until the adrenalin's worn off. The nice man in the picture is from Random House Germany who came, saw Mike McBride's God's End series, read some of The Fall overnight, came back and asked Anna for the synopsis of the rest and promptly offered us a three book deal for the lot! To his credit, even my offer, delivered with a high-pitched squeal, of a kiss - right there in the aisles - didn't put him off. 

Next up: brandwiches. That's right - not only a new song, but a new invention. 

<img alt=""brandwich.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/brandwich.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""267"" />

I had wrapped my new skirt in the tissue paper from the shop. Anna made her own sandwich (because you Do Not want to eat the crap they serve in the festhalle) and needed something to wrap it in. And lo, was born the brandwich, complete with sticker to safely seal it closed. 

There are loads of other things brewing, particularly interest in Sarah Stovell's Mothernight and Leila Johnston's <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005758.html"">How to Worry Friends</a>, but we'll just have to wait and see on those. We had lots of lovely visits from nice people and although we'd only gone with 12 meetings in the diary were chocka the whole time. 

So it's been interesting hearing people say that Frankfurt is outmoded. We have met people we would have never had the opportunity to meet; we have had our serendipidous meetings with all sorts of people (the lovely chaps who do own-label for Barnes and Noble; notable industry people with their little black address books of delights; people with interesting insights into some of the questions we've been wondering about, e.g. returns; new clients for our design services; new sub agents; and the Brazilian and Israeli publishers of Dan Brown who were v. interested in certain of our books, amongst lots of other things)  and we have had that wonderful thing happen where someone finds out about a book at the Fair, makes a decision, spits in his hand and holds it out. (He didn't really spit in his hand. It's a figure of speech.) 

So we are quids in (the deal paid for Frankfurt in its entirety) and with a richer address book. Can't complain about that! I think for small companies like ours who don't know every international publisher out there yet, it's a fabulous opportunity to meet, talk, share and enthuse and I wouldn't miss it for the world. And I am social recluse!","","","","2007-10-22","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Thought you might like to read this article from Mslexia: 

""Indie publisher Snowbooks is blowing the case for open submissions wide open: using their Snowblog, they are inviting prose submissions to the aptly termed 'Snowcase' and are publishing entries on a weekly basis. ""We operate an open submissions policy anyway,"" says Snowbooks' MD Emma Barnes. [hey, that's me!] ""But we get about 30 submissions a week and just can't publish them all. The immediate intention was to give the writing a wider audience - and some extra feedback.""","And it's working. ""There have been some really insightful and thoughtful comments,"" says Barnes. [hee, 'barnes'.] ""People say when they want to read more, explain what they like about the extract - it's fantastic that they are interested enough in the writing to comment.""

One possibility, she hopes, is that other publishers will read the writing and contact the authors. Barnes is well aware that Snowbooks' blog is read by people in publishing - and that word-of-mouth is golden: an eye catching entry may easily become next week's lunch topic. ""It has connected agents with writers,"" affirms Barnes. ""And all for free! This is the great thing. The publishing industry is wonderful in many ways but one of its shames is how impenetrable it is. We have to keep thinking of ways to break down those barriers.""","","","","2007-10-23","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

It's getting chilly at night. I suppose I could just turn the heat up and hang the expense but it's quite nice to be tucked up snugly in bed, under warm covers, in a cool room. The problem of course is that books don't hold themselves up, and my arms get cold if I extend them outside the protective cocoon of duvet. I think what is needed is some sort of fingerless opera glove, perhaps made of fleece, that extends all the way up to the shoulder.

<strong>The Needle In The Blood
by Sarah Bower

Epiphany
14th October 1066</strong>

The voice doesnt sound like his, though he can feel its vibrations in his throat. It sobs and growls, bellows and screeches like a cacophony of demons. <em>My name is Legion for we are many</em>. Odo is afraid hes lost his reason, but if the rumours are true, and William is dead, it might be better to be out of his mind. If Godwinson finds him.

You said this couldnt happen, he yells, in this voice like a cracked bell. The air is thick with smoke where fire tipped arrows have set the grass smouldering. You were the Wrath of God. How could you die?","He has let the reins go, one hand trails the borrowed sword, the other is clasped around the amulet he wears, the Tear of the Virgin, Williams gift. He has lost his shield. Fool. Lost his shield? What sort of soldier is he? Gods soldier, he is Gods soldier.

His horse plunges down the ridge, shouldering its way past crowds of men on foot, stumbling over corpses and hummocks of maram grass, slipping on churned earth, slimy with blood and spilt guts. Disorientated in the pall of dust and smoke, the animal rears to avoid a kneeling peasant trying to prise a severed hand from the hilt of a sword. Norman? Saxon? Which side of the line is he? Doesnt matter. The main thing is to stay in the saddle, clear of the melee of men on foot hacking and pulping one another. Heels down, weight forward, squeeze with the thighs, at one with the animal.  

Perhaps he is dead, not William, and the din battering his hearing, the sting of tar and horse sweat and burning fat in his nostrils, the eerie sense of being both in the thick of it yet watching himself from somewhere else, perhaps this is hell. He is a prince of the Church, which is inclined to make a man assume he is immune from hell, but he knows now that he has never truly believed it. Nothing is certain but uncertainty. 

His eyes smart, full of tears, or sweat, or blood, he cannot tell. His helmet is a vice, branding the rings of the chain mail hood beneath it into his temples and the tonsured crown of his head. Its possible he has been wounded, he cant remember, but there is such a pain in his heart. Yet it is still beating. He can hear it, feel its rhythmic rush and suck. Arrows drumming against leather shields. Silence. Reload. The whistle of quarrels from bowstrings. 

Instinctively he turns the horse broadside to the archers, to shield himself, and ducks behind its neck. Screams of fallen men and horses. Other men and horses. So he is still alive. A voice in his head taunts him. Which is more than this horse will be if you dont move. Horse, shield, what next?

Over to his right he can hear the Saxon war cry: Goddemite, God Almighty. The men in the front line on top of the ridge shake their shields in time with the chanting. The sun is out now, burnishing blood and weapons, gilding the smoke pall. The iron rims and bosses of Saxon shields flash in the corner of his eye. To the left the Norman response, Williams motto: Dex Aie, God aid us.

Weird that no one's cracked down on spam yet, isn't it? Either by catching the culprits - because presumably if they remain totally anonymous they can't cash in on their spam. Or you might have expected us to change the way we use e-mail to make spamming more difficult. 

Spam is annoying and a fair amount of it you wouldn't want kids (or your mum) to read. But I'm not the first to spot that the way in which spam text constantly evolves to foil spam filters can occasionally result in some surreally zen-like prose. One item I got today actually was poetry. No mention of V1$$agra that I could see. And lately I've started to get a lot of German spam. And since I don't speak German it's even more pointless than most. The picture above was included in the most recent e-mail. I don't even know what that is. Apologies if it turns out to be something rude, but really, spam for things I can't identify in languages I don't speak surely has to be a side-effect of the internet that no one predicted.","","","","","2007-10-25","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

Was reading about how one way to cut down on spam comments to blogs is to have people choose all the cats from some pictures of cats and dogs to prove that they're humans. Apparently people prefer clicking on kittens to typing in warpified strings of text. And spammy robots find it difficult to tell a cat from a dog. Stupid robots. There's also a less PC version where you're asked to select the 'hot' people from a grid of photos. Not sure about that. Lowers the tone of the internet if you ask me.","","","","","2007-10-25","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Maybe a later SnowBlog post will mention what I've been up to this morning, but it's been very funny. When life gives you lemons, created a lemon-powered marketing machine, that's my advice. Anyway, enough of being cryptic and silly, I'm afraid this post is actually one of my perennial downers. Sorry for the shift in tone, but this is where the lighthearted bit ends. I want to mention something compellingly unfunny.","Whatever you think about the wisdom of invading and occupying Iraq there's no denying that millions of Iraqis have been so affected by the violence all around them that they've fled the country. The Coalition of the Willing haven't been much interested in giving new homes to the displaced, which to my mind is rather hardhearted of us, and since we rarely see this conflict through the eyes of Iraqis, not much is said about it in the press. For that reason, I heartily recommend reading <a href=""http://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/"">Riverbend's blog</a>, which has been turned into a couple of fascinating <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Baghdad-Burning-Girl-Blog-Iraq/dp/0714531308/ref=sr_1_3/202-9753359-2829418?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1193396854&sr=1-3"">books</a>. She is an extremely able writer and the experiences she relates of self, friends, family and her nation as a whole let you see it all from the inside. She does something that the press have never managed to do: to make Iraqis seems just like Brits or Americans or anyone else. There's lots of humour and family squabbles and silliness, and so when she talks about bombs going off or people she knows being killed it no longer seems distant or somehow OK because it's happening to foreigners thousands of miles away. You can't help but imagine how you'd feel in her shoes.

Oh, you have to admire it. There's a lot to like about Stephen Fry and I posted a link here when he wrote on his shiny new blog (still with its new-blog smell) about mobile phones, paying particular attention to the complicated kind. Now he's been asked to do a bit more of it for the Guardian. And don't you just love this sort of thing? Before he can get to discussing SmartPhones a few preparatory remarks are called for: 
<span style=""font-family: times; color: #091768; font-size: 120%;""> ""When WH Auden produced his collection of critical writings, <em>The Dyer's Hand</em>, he first laid out a list of his preferences and predispositions, believing it right that the reader should know what sort of person they were encountering and be able thereby to form a judgment of his opinions in the light of his prejudices. I ought to do the same.""</span>
I'm sure he knows how all that looks. Using Auden as a guide for a mobile phone review.  I'm sure he realises how preposterously delicious that will seem to a certain sort of person. If, like me, you are that sort of person, then read on: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,2198814,00.html"">here</a>

So this is one of those posts that I implore you to comment on so I don't have to make decisions on my own. This is the question: how much do you want to pay for our books?","I know. It's a stupid question because you might say 'Onepence, and not a farthing more.' But I think we are all friends here together, and you understand the commercial pressures this little company faces as well as I. 

So what I'm really interested in is figuring out how much to charge for books on our website. See, I really appreciate it when people buy books direct from this site. It is a lovely, intimate way of doing business and leads to friendships. It offers me the chance to build a contacts list. It gives me an idea of who's interested in what, and why: all invaluable information. And it is also a chance for you, the kind purchaser, to show that you support Snowbooks in a direct and meaningful way. So the last thing I want to do is fleece you, our most valuable of customers. 

Thing is, at the moment all the prices on the website are the full list price. True, they are free of postage in the UK, but still. I can't help but feel a bit bad about that. So what would you have me do? What sort of discount do you think would make you feel like it was worth your while buying direct from us (without all the one-clicky goodness of Amazon or the browsablility of a large store) - whilst making sure that Snowbooks made a little bit of money too? 

Bear in mind that I really want to get some significant volume through the website for our Christmas gift books. I want to offer people a great price, and great service. Service is not a prob, providing the post office manage to stay in business for a few more weeks - but I want the price to be compelling and to reward people who make the effort to buy from us. 

(Also, Eoin, if we change our prices I will give you a retrospective discount as you kindly paid full whack plus overseas postage for Cooking with Booze the other day and I would hate for you to be disadvantaged!)

I am all ears.","","","","2007-10-27","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","16"

... nothing when it comes to proofreading. 

Answer me this, linguistics fans. (That'll be you then, Rob. We really should find some other way of communicating rather than via this blog. If only there were some sort of cable-based system where individual handsets, incorporating both a speaker and microphone, could be allocated a number, and if entered on an associated keypad the handsets could connect to each other? Maybe in the fantastical, far-off future. But I digress.) Is written language so blinking complicated that a computer can't be told all its rules? I thought not. So why do I still have to spend 48 hours proofreading a book manually? 

Surely - surely - there must be a program somewhere that automatically flags up things like missing punctuation, capitalised letters where they shouldn't be, inverted commas the wrong way round, hyphens where en dashes should be, doubled up words, words that shouldn't be next to each other and so on? 

I should really get on with my Java coursework, then write an application to do it. It can't be that hard.","","","","","2007-10-27","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Yes, it's probably time for me to admit to being a bit of a sexist. For instance, I'm not an unreserved fan of equal gender rights. I tend to think the world would be a better place if the current gender ratio in high places was reversed rather than equalised. Testosterone is just such volatile stuff that equal rights might be a luxury the world can't afford.

But perhaps more shocking are my views about the attraction between men and women. To my mind, the facts are these: most women spend most of their time feeling cold, especially in bed. Most men aren't much bothered by cold, especially in bed. Men like women because they are nice to have around and attractive-looking, and women like men because they need something to warm their chilly extremities on.

Yes. What I'm saying is that most women are frigid. Just not sexually. And that, I think, explains why the post I wrote about having chilly arms in bed has inspired more comments than any other - and all of them from women.","","","","","2007-10-28","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","12"

And everything I do turns to gold this week. 

This is how it's meant to be! Orders piling up, customers getting themselves sorted out and putting our stock out in the right places, cover design work flowing in at just the right level, bit of sunshine, new bag of coffee, everything's right with the world. 

Except for one thing.","So I looked at our orders this morning. Excellent, lots of orders coming in from lots of stores. Except, and I checked this, today is the 30th October. October has 31 days. So why the bloody hell are the orders dated 1st November? So that they can pay 30 days later, that's why, because most customers pay at the end of the month that the invoice falls due. If an invoice is raised on 30th October, with 60 day payment terms I'd get the money on 30th December (or thereabouts). If an invoice is raised on 1st November, with the same terms, I'll get the money on 30th January. Makes a bloomin' big difference, I can tell you. 

<strike>I'm really cross about this because it's mean. I normally hate it when suppliers complain about their customers (it is not the cleverest thing to do) but just for once, just for today, the customer is not always right. </strike>

Oh, now see? The very first time I think bad thoughts against our customers, I'm wrong. Turns out it's a distribution issue! Who'd have thought. Month end is 27th October this month (financial month end, not actual month end, silly.) Orders that are released after that date are, for some reason, put into the next calendar month. No, it makes no sense to me, either. Customers, I fall at your feet and apologise for doubting you!","","","","2007-10-30","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

To continue Em's gilded theme: a golden oldie. I've dug out my Sony Libri&eacute; from a few  years back. Any day now we're going to try the new Sony e-Reader, which I'm hoping will have an even better display. But as you can see, my slightly ag&eacute;d Libri&eacute; does very nicely in bright sunshine. It's infinitely better than a laptop or phone display, but there's still room for improvement. And before you all remind me that you'd rather have a paper book, you should know that this is a submission I'm reading, so my alternatives are either a  laser-printed brick; break out the guillotine, nipping-press and glue to make my own reader's copy; or read the thing on a computer screen. Oh, and to follow on from our earlier discussions about reading in bed, this gadget doesn't have that verso/recto problem that comes with resting your book on the pillow, where you find that for every other page you have to balance it on its edge - which often leads to holding the book in both hands in the air, the result of which is <em>libric brachial heat loss</em> (or 'cold arms while reading' as it's sometimes known). Whereas with this gadget  I can extend just a few fingers of one hand from under the duvet, tightening my grip occasionally to push the 'next page' button.","Also, if you were a nerd like me, you'd think it was cool that the buttons are in Japanese.

Rupert Haighs work has appeared in various publications, including Gold Dust, the Ginosko Literary Journal and Twisted Tongue. He lives in Helsinki.

Pretty Girls Make Graves is a murder mystery with thirty-something relationship element. A seemingly fatal car crash draws Giles into an intrigue that leads to the uncovering of decades-old murder and the disintegration of his marriage.","A faint breeze came in through the open window, rustling the edge of the curtain. Giles lay on his back, his hand resting gently on Saras thigh. She snuggled closer to him on the pillow, pressing the tip of her nose lightly against his bare shoulder. For a minute or two, neither spoke. He listened to the sea and felt his body unwind. 
Eventually, she lifted her head and said, Ive got something to tell you. I stopped taking the pill yesterday.
He pulleddrew his hand away from her thigh as if it had been stung, and turned awkwardly to look at her. His voice, when he was able to find it, came out strangulated. You stopped taking the pill? Just like that? So you mean you might be pregnant right now? 
Its highly theoretical at this stage.
But you might be?
I suppose it is possible, yes.
For Gods sake, Sara. You cant just go ahead and decide something like that unilaterally.
She drew away from him, dragging the duvet across the crumpled sheets. Cant I? Why not? Its my body.
Thats not the only consideration, he said icily. Why didnt you at least talk to me about it first?
Were talking now, she replied, and rolled over onto her side, facing away from him.
Sensing that she was withdrawing into her shell, as she tended to do when challenged, Giles decided to try a gentler approach. He waited a few seconds and then put a hand on her shoulder. Sara, why are you being like this?
Because Ive made up my mind, Giles. I want to have a baby.
But why right now?
Now seemed as good a time as any. Besides, I was reading a book written by a medical expert  that said youre more likely to conceive on holiday, because youre relaxed then.
Giles sighed. Yet the holiday had started promisingly. The sun had shone steadily all day long. Theyd arrived at the cottage around midday after a trouble-free run down from London, unpacked immediately and then embarked on a stout walk in the surrounding countryside. This had been followed by a couple of hours on the beach, which theyd had virtually to themselves. The evening meal, which consisted of a chicken salad which theyd brought down with them, washed down with some nicely chilled Chablis, had been leisurely and enjoyable, making the transition to bed a little before 9pm entirely natural, in fact inevitable. Theyd made love with a conviction that, Giles felt, signalled a genuine sense of renewal.
Saras revelation had destroyed his fragile equilibrium.
Christ, he muttered. Im not relaxed now.
Sara didnt reply. 
Did you hear me, Sara? I said Im not relaxed now.
I heard you.
We need to talk about this. Its not good enough for to just say youve decided and thats that.
Not now, she said.
She switched on her bedside light, got out of bed, and padded across the landing to the bathroom.

<em>The Apocalypse Experiment</em>

This is the story of the last days of the human race, and a scientist's attempt to reverse disaster. It bears less resemblance than you'd think to the film Children of Men.","<strong>The Apocalypse Experiment</strong>

I woke to a phone ringing, and an enthusiastic female on the other end of the line saying ""Is this Mr. Jason Geist?""

""Yes,"" I said. I rubbed my eyes. ""Who's this?""

""This is Bonnie Smith from NewsWorld,"" said the voice. ""I understand this is your fiftieth birthday?""

Still half-asleep, I looked at the window, where the date was glowing faintly. ""Yes, it is.""

""Wonderful!"" cooed Bonnie. ""I'm calling because I hope you can appear on our program, Mr. Geist. We're doing a special on the Last Babies.""

Her tone turned serious. ""It's about the youngest people in the world. The last people born before...you know."" She went bright again. ""And I was hoping you'd be willing to appear!""

Damn. Not again. Every five years they pulled this. ""No, thank you, Ms. Smith. I've been on enough of those things. Why don't you cobble something together from 2116's Last Babies special? I think it's still out there somewhere."" I was about to hang up.

""Oh, please, Mr. Geist, won't you? Our viewers want to hear your thoughts on the--""

""No."" I hung up.

My thoughts on the--disaster. On the--tragedy. On the--annihilation.

""I don't have any thoughts,"" I mumbled. ""Is that good enough for you?""

All my life I'd been getting attention for the goddamn Invasion, and for twenty years I'd been doing Last Babies specials (and turning them down). I didn't understand why they wanted to hear from me, because I felt like I was one of the least qualified people--along with all the other people turning 50 today--to talk about it. I didn't have a life Pre-Invasion. What was I supposed to think about it? A world of adults was all I knew.

I got up and pushed the shade button. Light flooded the room, and as soon as I got over cringing I looked out the window. Roger was already up, and he was walking around the spinach garden, pulling the occasional weed, Rusty trailing behind. He looked toward the house and saw me. We waved at each other.

Roger should be the one to appear on NewsWorld, I felt. His opinions on the--whatever were actually meaningful. He spent hours every day browsing the net, reading the old news briefs and watching the old footage. He loves all that history stuff, but I just can't get interested.

I went to the lav and odor-removed, and then I vacuumed my teeth and splashed some water over my eyes. My face was scruffy, but I didn't feel like a shave. When I got back to my room, I switched on the viewscreen and turned to NewsWorld. The same old statistics rode by on the ticker below the male anchor's serious face: 87% OF PSYCH CENTERS ABOVE MAXIMUM CAPACITY...6,000 SUICIDES IN THE LAST FIFTEEN DAYS...TRI-US POPULATION AT 2.6 MILLION...3/4 OF CONGRESSIONAL SEATS EMPTY...LIFE EXPECTANCY 124.4 YEARS...BIRTH RATE ZERO.

The displays are getting more paper-like, the designs are getting sexier, the prices are slowly coming down. e-Readers keep getting better. And you know how fickle people are. Yes, they love books, but once upon a time they were little and they loved playing with a ball or using their imagination to make up games, and then they saw an Xbox and they never stirred from the sofa again. Once upon a time they loved their vinyl records and their cassette walkmans and their portable CD Discmans and their mini-disc players, and then they saw an iPod and now all that other stuff is up in the attic. Are we going to be like the out-of-touch grandparent trying to get kids interested in colouring and board games when what they want is a Playstation Portable loaded with games and a few movies on UMD? Are we expecting them to demand paper books no matter how shiny, jaw-dropping and expensively-marketed e-Readers are?

I have had to move offices this morning, because the damp proof course in my old office needed doing and then someone else wanted the space. Hmph. I only had to move to another room in KP's empire, though, and it's lovely and quiet. I can imagine being very happy up here in the rafters. Plus I now have what I think I'll call an ante-chamber - oooh. So I am currently covered in dust and aching from carrying millions of boxes. But the main reason for the post is this: if you are in the habit of knocking on my window when you come to see me, I'd advise against it now. You'll just get a nice middle aged lady peering back at you.

<em>Rob's update</em>: Just to clarify that last sentence, previously if you tapped on the window, that's not what would have happened. None of the peering you received from nice ladies would have been middle-aged.","","","","","2007-11-01","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

When I was in my early teens* it wasn't uncommon for me to lay on my front on the living room carpet about five feet from the TV and watch repeats of Star Trek. I wanted a phaser, a communicator and a tricorder. Some part of me is aware that I'm about fifty percent of the way there now. I know it's unforgivably nerdy but I thought you might want to see the sort of techno-junk I lug around with me as a matter of course. I share this with you as a public service so that you can feel superior.

*insert for yourself the phrase, 'and dinosaurs still walked the Earth'.","For scale, that first photo above is my mobile phone next to an apple. Which I plan to eat once I've finished this (eat apple, not phone). Next I've added an assortment of stuff typically found in different pockets of the (not especially large) bag I tend to carry with me if I'm out.
<img alt=""kit1.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/kit1.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""186"" />
So what can you do with all that shiny junk? Well, I'm busy trying to do some writing at the moment, so I'd unfold that flat silver thing like this:
<img alt=""kit2.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/kit2.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""327"" />
And then I'd have a full-sized keyboard. It's linked to a phone-based version of Microsoft Word via Bluetooth, so the keyboard and the phone can be detached from each other, which is how I tend to work on a train.
<img alt=""kit3.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/kit3.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""340"" />
I could also simultaneously listen to some music with that stupid looking stereo headset. My phone holds a few hours of music, news programs and videos. For audio-only stuff, the phone goes in my pocket and I can control volume, jump between tracks and take phone calls using the buttons up by my ears. Because it looks so idiotic I tend not to use it where people can see me.
<img alt=""kit4.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/kit4.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""399"" />
And finally, what happens if I get lost? Well, the little blue thing listens to the network of GPS satellites which surround this planet and then it tells me where I am. Then my phone displays the relevant O.S. map complete with a little 'you are here' dot. Like the keyboard and headset it uses Bluetooth, so no wires. The blue thing can stay in my bag.
<img alt=""kit5.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/kit5.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""399"" />
 A quick rummage through the remaining pockets of the bag revealed the following items:
<img alt=""kit6.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/kit6.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""308"" />
You can probably identify the lip balm and Swiss Army knife. Then there's a little LED torch,  a yes-you-guessed-it space pen, a little cable that let's me use my phone as a USB drive, an honest-to-goodness paper book and a gadget that will be familiar from a <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/10/old_tech.html"">recent post</a>. For people who've paid really close attention to old posts, the book's taking me ages to (re-)read because I only dip into it occasionally - though it's very good. There also seems to be a sticker with my name on it adorned with a drawing of a crocodile. Not sure why that's in there but I suspect Em's involvement. It all fits in here with lots of room to spare. And you can see by comparing it with the remains of that very tasty apple, it's not a gigantic bag.
<img alt=""kit7.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/kit7.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""375"" />
So there you are. A terrifying insight into my teenage-gadget-freak brain. Now all I have to do is to decide whether I can be bothered to go back and resize those images so that they don't poke over the edge of the middle column.

So I watch quite a lot of TV. Most of which is scripted dramas, generally with a bit of a thriller or adventure element. I'm a bit envious of Em and Anna who hardly ever turn the telly on, but on the other hand I'm very interested in that sort of storytelling - how you do it, what works, what happens behind the scenes. I used to get very frustrated with overly-neat TV shows that insisted on returning to the <em>status quo ante</em> at the end of each episode. It lead to that silly scenario where if one of the characters gets into a relationship with someone you know that either a) their love interest will die or b) their love interest will turn out to be evil. Eliminating any sort of progression allowed U.S. TV networks to show reruns in any order. That led me onto thinking about other forms of interference in visual storytelling, the way certain kinds of shows have to maintain an eye-candy quotient; they can't tackle storylines that will be a turn-off to advertisers; and any movie with a budget over $40m has to have an American lead (or an actor pretending to be American). You listen to DVD commentaries and read insider interviews and it's amazing how often 'the studio' wanted this change or 'the network' would prefer it if that happened. It made me realise that novels are the last great uncensored, un-demographically targeted, un-commercially tweaked form of mass storytelling. And I wondered how long that will last.","Even the best movie script runs the risk of being altered and re-written before it gets made. How long before a publishing company sets out to create a blockbuster novel, rather than waiting for it to drop into their lap? Has it already happened? In fact, why not play publisher-as-god for a moment and try designing the ultimate blockbuster in your head. Would it need to appeal to kids <u>and</u> grown-ups (<em>a la</em> Joanna Rowling)? Would it involve a technowhizzery hook like Michael Crichton? The uncovering of a Big Secret told with a form of metronomic onion-peeling tension-building <em>a la</em> D. Brown? Maybe it would seek to combine more than one of those approaches.

So what do you say to that prospect? I'm afraid I've come to think of publishing as having more than its fair share of those who chant 'it will never happen' when faced with any scenario involving change. So, in this case, will it never happen a) because the public are just too discerning to swallow it*? b) no novel-writer or publisher would compromise their integrity by assisting with it**? or c) there's just not enough money in books to make it worthwhile***?


* Exhibit A for the prosecution: tell-all celebrity 'biographies'

Susie Nott-Bower's novel, The Change, is about the metamorphosis of two middle-aged women whose lives are tested, torn apart and ultimately transformed by their involvement in a television makeover programme.
 
Susie spent twenty years working for the BBC and Channel Four.  She transformed her own life by moving to Cornwall in her fiftieth year.
 
In THE CHANGE, Pete, a blind rock musician, is about to meet his nemesis in a toilet at AZ Productions...","THE CHANGE
 
Pete Street carefully places the statuette on the cistern, unzips his fly and pees.  A stream of relief, smelling strong and umber.  His head still rings with the clatter and roar of applause, the confusing cross-talk, the resonating bodies, hands reaching to clap him on the shoulder, lips leaving soft wet imprints in his cheeks.  He has hated every second of it.
     Without the guitar, he is a one-armed man.  A man without a friend.  The guitar is his stability, his brother, his companion.  This world-without-guitar is scattered and fragile, compromising and misleading.  People can approach him without his say-so, finger him.  Too close.  Prying, pushing him for words he refuses to deliver.  
     When he lost his way earlier and stumbled into that other, alien studio he had panicked, surrounded, crushed in by a weight of anonymous bodies.  He had fought through hot flesh, cheap scent, stale lager breath, sharp elbows, furiously regretting his own refusal of Jongo's guidance.  Jongo knew better than to push it, but on this occasion Pete wished he had.
     The lavatory flushes, sucking.  Seemingly, there are no urinals.  He zips, reaches reluctantly for the statuette.  It is cold, angular in his hand.  A lifetime achievement award.  An icon for an icon.  This is it, then.  The sum of his ambition, of his discomfort.  They had to give him this, rather than any of the other awards on offer tonight.  He doesn't qualify for Best Single or Best Solo Artist.  They are for today's performers, working artists with passion, creativity, drive.  The line of platinums on his wall at home testify to those qualities.  But that was a decade ago, when he was writing.  Now, they wheel him out once in a while, when Jongo decides it's time.  They say he makes good television.
     It's bloody Jongo's fault.  He had rung unexpectedly, caught Pete on the hop.
     ""C'mon, laddy, it's a great opportunity.""  Jongo's Glaswegian realism thundered down the airwaves.  ""You've got tae come out and accept the thing.""
     ""Why?""
     ""Sales, my lad, sales.""  Pete could almost smell Jongo's heavy breath.
     ""I don't need money.""
     Jongo harrumphed.  ""Well, I do, laddy.  How else will I keep m'self in malt?""
     And so it went on. All for the sake of another re-hash of Pete Street: Greatest Hits.  Another tired old album from a tired old man.
     He fingers the award.  What if I just leave it?  He imagines the scene: some bloke coming in for a crap, finding it, taking it home to the wife.  Look what I got, Marlene.  Pete Street.  Remember him?  He clinks the statuette back onto the cistern, turns to go.  Hears the soft sound of flat shoes on linoleum in the corridor outside.  Feels his shoulders tighten.  Why the hell did he send Jongo home?
     Someone's coming in.  He pulls the cubicle door closed, finds the bolt.  It won't budge.  He turns, lowers the seat slowly, silently, and sits.

Cory Doctorow* gives away, free of charge, electronic copies of the books he writes. They're also available to buy in conventional form (what he calls 'p-books', and I'm reasonably confident that he's being playful when he uses that term).

I think <a href=""http://www.kottke.org/07/11/cory-doctorow"">this here</a> is the sort of article that's worth reading even if you disagree with his positions, because they're set forth in neatly compelling terms that provide a useful sense-check of your own beliefs.

Yey!","From their website:

World Book Day is launching a new campaign Spread the Word: Books to Talk About to harness the power of recommendation, particularly among keen readers who already belong to reading groups or who have always wanted to. It will focus on books which have genuine word of mouth appeal and which would make excellent subjects for discussion, whether within a reading group or online.

Publishers submissions will be whittled down to a long list of 100 titles to form a list detailed here from the beginning of November 2007 and in the media. Reading Groups and individuals will be invited to discuss, comment upon and vote for their favourite title. The incentive to get involved will be a weekly draw amongst voters to win 100 of National Book Tokens right through until World Book Day 2008. 

The top ten titles by 1st February will also form the focus of the Spread the Word: Books to Talk About reading groups to be held throughout bookshops and libraries on or around World Book Day. The authors featuring in the top ten will take part in some of these events, and will participate in online discussions. As well as existing reading groups and book clubs taking part in these events, bookshops and libraries will encourage people who have always meant to participate to take part in a taster book club. This will be a chance for some real face to face social networking, a chance for people to come out from behind their computer screens to celebrate World Book Day.

Further on-line voting throughout February will result in the announcement of a winner  The Book to Talk About 2008, and an award of 5000 to the author.","","","","2007-11-07","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","6"

Thing #1: hearing that even the big boys are finding it tough out there: 

<em>For the second year in a row, HarperCollins has had a poor start to its new fiscal year. Last year, sales fell 6% and earnings dropped 21% in the first quarter, and in the period ended September 30 this year sales fell 11.5%, to $330 million, and operating income plunged 52.8%, to $36 million. ""It was a lousy quarter,"" acknowledged CEO Jane Friedman. ""We knew things were going to be down, but we didn't think they'd be down this much.""
She attributed the declines to a ""terrible"" quarter in the U.K. and a significant drop in sales in the children's segment in the U.S. </em>","","","","","2007-11-08","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

The BBC website <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7069793.stm"">has it thus</a>: 

""A nationwide brigade of personal transport advisers who call at the homes of drivers thinking of switching to greener forms of travel could help break Britain's dependency on the car. 

The idea is among those being mulled by the government in a major new strategy aimed at cutting carbon emissions. The advisers are already pounding the streets of three trial cities. In Peterborough, 750,000 has been spent on giving 20,000 people personal advice to help them use public transport or cycle.""

Chuffing heck! As my esteemed author Richard Ballantine points out, 750,000 on 20,000 people works out to 37.50 a head. As he also points out, ""How about a good cheap book instead?""

<strong>In which I finally get round to saying what happened to me yesterday</strong>
So, I've been cursing First Great Western Railways for running a once-per-hour service to London from The Sticks (where I live), but missing the hour that would get me to London when I need to be there. So instead of having half an hour to travel from West to East London, I have an hour and a half. Which is far too much time. Or maybe they know something I don't, because something always seems to go wrong with my journey and I end up being late. So much so that I'm seriously beginning to wonder if I should get the earlier train and leave two and half hours to get from Paddington to Brick Lane.","Last week I got creative and tried Chiltern Railway's line instead. I bought my train ticket and car parking ticket (which they print out on the same piece of orange and palest-green card that train tickets come on). Then I carefully put the train ticket on the dashboard of the car and set off for London with the car park ticket in my pocket. When I got to the other end and found the car park ticket wouldn't allow me to travel on the tube, there was a certain amount of administrative hassle involved in sorting everything out. I can't blame Chiltern Railways, though; they were super helpful and it was very nearly entirely my own fault (though making the two types of ticket look alike could easily confuse a stupid person).

This week it was back to First Great Western and they really excelled themselves. They got me in late to Paddington and as I was packing up my stuff a man came round saying to hurry up because the train was behind schedule. I obviously wasn't quick enough though, because just before I got to the door it closed and then wouldn't open. On the big inter-city trains there's no handle and no way to wind the window down. There's just a button you push and pushing it did nothing. I made my way down the train pushing all the buttons and none of them worked. The train was deserted and there was no way off it. I spent the next two minutes trying to wave at passing staff, without success, before the train pulled out of the station to head off to the storage depot in Harlesden. Surreal. Twenty minutes later, when we got there, I was able to attract someone's attention and actually get off the train. But of course I was now in a depot and not a station. The driver kindly arranged a cab for me and apologised: the platform staff aren't supposed to seal the doors without checking the train is empty - which I think is an excellent rule. Unfortunately for me, the cab took half an hour to arrive, despite it being 'two minutes away' for twenty-five of those minutes. So yet again, the hour-and-a-half I'd left myself to get across London wasn't enough. I'm going to try my current approach a few more times before switching to Plan B, whereby I come up to London the night before and spend the day trying to get to Brick Lane for three.

I almost can't wait to find out what will go wrong next week.

<hr/>

Forgot to mention: on the way home the hour-and-a-half journey turned into two-and-a-half-hours because one of the train's headlights started to fall out and we had to wait for a man to come and glue it back in. I suppose it wouldn't do to drive a train without both headlights working. You could end up anywhere.","","","","2007-11-09","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

Political post","I always feel so naive about things like this, but I really didn't know in the case of the shooting of J.C. de Menezes that the police were allowed to intentionally kill anyone. For me the case is less about  questioning whether they used their authority to kill people appropriately and more about my surprise that they had that authority. When did that happen?

Picking up another story in the news: I also can't believe how easy the West is on itself over civilian deaths. Of course accidents happen in wartime, but what about when it's not an accident? What about when someone drops an atomic bomb on a city, not because it's wholly, or even largely a military garrison, but because they want to demoralise a country? How is that not a truly awful war crime? The justification given for using nuclear weapons against civilian targets was that it saved soldiers' lives, but again, I didn't realise that was a moral principle our countries recognised. (And let's set aside for a moment that many people believe Japan was already trying to arrange surrender terms.) Imagine if instead of using an atomic bomb we'd used firing squads to rid ourselves of several hundred thousand Japanese civilians. It would have been more humane than radiation poisoning, but is there a sense in which that would have been morally worse? Would it still have been justified? For his sake, I'm glad the pilot of the Enola Gay didn't feel as though he had done a bad thing, but you have to wonder, how many tens of thousands of women, children, old people and babies can a person kill in one day before it starts to seem like a crime. I must be naive because I just don't get it.

Note: as per usual, I'm not saying that America had lower moral standards than Britain, they just applied them on a slightly larger scale. You wouldn't know it from the Nuremberg Trials, but we did our fair share of intentionally firebombing civilian targets.","","","","2007-11-09","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

Well there's a thing. Em linked to <a href=""http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/"">Russell Davies's blog</a> (he of the reliably fine Earth-based writing and not his namesake of the variable-quality off-world fare) because he'd said some favourable things about a couple of our titles. In checking out the post in question I was sad to see that Russell's book <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Egg-Bacon-Chips-Beans-Great/dp/0007213786/ref=sr_1_1/203-5688651-9881538?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194719952&sr=8-1"">Eggs, Bacon, Chips and Beans</a> didn't sell as well as he would have liked. It's such a shame because it's been one of my favourites since it came out, although I could see why not everyone might 'get it' at first glance.","It's a series of informal reviews of greasy spoons, specifically their ability to provide a good plate of eggs, bacon, chips and beans, in harmonious surroundings, and it's illustrated with oodles of photos. On the face of it, it doesn't sound like a great read; more of a reference book aimed at a very particular group of people none of whom quite possibly are you. But it's charming and funny. Its disquisition comparing the two leading brands of brown sauces is a perfect poetic kaleidoscope of subsconscious British iconography. I defy you not to be amused. And somehow the jaunty captions on the photos hit exactly the right tone to tickle and entertain. They're like the next link in the evolutionary chain that gave us Three Men in a Boat, and Music Hall, and Carry On films, and Morecambe and Wise Christmas Specials, and Beano and Dandy annuals*. 

Of course it probably helps if, like me, you'd rather eat food that comes with a mug of tea. It also helps if like me you're a connoisseur of whimsy. But surely there are more than 4,702 of those in this land - though disappointingly that's the number who have so far gone out and bought a copy. I sincerely doubt whether that fully reflects the book's capacity to delight. I would have thought five or six times as many would have been a sensible start. 

So anyway, try to bear all that in mind as you're doing your Christmas shopping. There must be someone in your life with a sense of humour and a fondness for the simpler pleasures in life, who'd get some yuletide pleasure from this book (and I wouldn't be at all surprised if they were male as well).

I've spent a while studying various sciences and a while trying to get the hang of writing, and whatever my successes or otherwise in those areas, one definite effect has been to make me a snob about the science writing I'll read. But Tim Flannery needn't worry. He does a fine job with his material. My only complaint... in fact it's not even a complaint, it's a niggle, a quibble... in fact if I'm honest it says more about me than Prof. Flannery... it's just that he begins a section on the detrimental consequences of climate change by talking about the precarious future of the alpine habitats of New Guinea. And, professional zoologist that he is, he eulogises over the fauna, specifically the way the myriad of webs catch the morning light and illuminate the burrows of the <em>Mallomys Gunung</em>. He's undoubtedly right and it's a precious habitat the loss of which will be a tragedy.

Sarah Ann Watts remains mysteriously silent, bio-wise, but she has submitted her novel Zero Summer. 

Is there life after death? Do you really want to find out? Beyond the grave all things are possible","Zero summer

The horses plodded under the hot August sun and the cart wheels creaked. The grim procession rode on, the soldiers irritably swatting at the flies that tormented their horses, the condemned fallen silent now as the familiar sights of home drew closer and they looked for the beacon on the hill. 

Mark raised his head and stared up at the great open expanse of the sky, the white clouds that scurried across the heavens, and drew in deep breaths of the heather scented air, trying to ignore the stench of fear that sat upon him and the doomed human cargo. He had thought he was reconciled to his fate, willing to die but something, maybe the wine, had altered his mood and he was not ready to say farewell to the world  not yet. He sighed, letting out his breath in a long exhalation as he sought to conquer his fear.

The priest was watching him closely.

You want to live? he said quietly. 

I dont want to die!

The priest rose to his feet as if to rebuke him  and Mark flinched from the righteous anger he expected but then he heard the priest laughing softly. There was a single ruby set in a heavy gold ring glinting on his hand. Mark had never seen any priest wear such a thing  it looked pagan, Roman. No one wants to die. Take my hand.

The sun caught Mark full in the eyes, dazzled by the glare he reached blindly for the priests hand and felt it close around his. The drone of the bees and the creak of harness, low groans and muttered prayers and imprecations died. The silence was absolute and as his vision cleared he saw that everything had stopped. The horses stood as statues, the leaders had one hoof off the ground, the carts had stalled and looking back he saw the soldiers turned to lead like toys and the condemned frozen in attitudes of misery, their faces clenched tight against fear. Looking up in that still moment he saw the clouds suspended in the sky and it seemed the radiance of the sun had dimmed.  

The priest laughed and pushed back his cowl and as if he had given a signal Mark saw other people emerging from the trees  no, there were no trees. It was as if they had appeared from nowhere. Mark blinked, his eyes could make no sense of what he had seen and yet suddenly they were there as if they had answered the summons of the priest. An old man dressed like a village squire, a younger man with gold circling his wrist like a halo that had slipped, a lady in riding habit, her veil over her face, riding a grey mare and her servant or groom, thickset in heavy clothes despite the heat, leading two horses.

The priest turned to Mark,

Can you ride?

I'm going to be launching a website next week called <a href=""http://www.thepubbench.com."">www.thepubbench.com.</a> It's a forum for publishers to share information: whether that's benchmarking information, such as comparing returns rates and printers, or tips and insights, such as how to create printer files, how to calculate a spine width, tips on cover design and typesetting, how best to manage and calculate royalties, and so on. It's not just me blathering on - I hope that lots of publishers will join, contribute and learn valuable things.

It looks like we're currently getting one to two real comments each day plus one to two hundred spam comments. That doesn't seem right. Plus the number of spam comments seemed to spike sharply after I first wrote about spam. Maybe I shouldn't use the word any more. In future I'll just refer to 'reconstituted meat products' (RMP).

Anyway, if the RMP levels continue to rise we might have to start using one of those read-the-woosy-text things to screen out the robo-junk - or, if it's ready for the market and not too expensive, one of those <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/10/spam_update.html"">spot-the-cat</a> thingies. As for the fact that we only get one to two comments per day, I'm thinking some sort of pay-by-the-word cash incentive might work. Although even that's not guaranteed; as soon as Em announced a prize for the 1000th comment, people stayed away in droves. No, I suppose it will have to down to good old-fashioned engaging with our audience and raising topics on which they have strong views.

I'm sceptical that switching my light-bulbs to a lower energy type will do much to stave off climate change. I mean if I do it (and I'm getting there), plus everyone else does it too, it will help, but what bothers me is that it tackles one of the little slices on the pie chart of carbon pollution without really touching any of the big ones. It seems silly for me to be fiddling around with a few watts here and there while generating stations chew through megatonnes of filthy coal. But can you believe there is a change I can make in my little domestic way that really will scale up into big industrial changes if enough people do it too?","Stop eating meat. Simple as that. A big chunk of the world's carbon pollution comes from whatever-the-proper-word-for-carnivorous-farming-is. It seems ridiculous that switching to a meat-free diet could really slow climate change, but it looks like the figures stack up. It would make a really big difference because it's just so inefficient to grow food crops and feed them to a critter and then eat the critter, instead of just eating the food crop in the first place. Finally I've come across something we can all do that really will change the world and it doesn't involve living in a house made of straw or adding two hours to my day because I've got rid of my car. This one is easy. So as of this moment I'm going to give up eating meat. I might allow myself one exception per year - perhaps a Christmas dinner of pepperoni pizza - but I reckon as lifestyle changes go, this is so much easier than trying to get everywhere on public transport (when I live a bus-free five miles from the nearest station) or attempting to heat my bathwater using the sun. Anyone want to join me? Remember, future generations will probably despise vegetarians significantly less than the rest of us.

So, I tend to let my phone wake me up in the mornings. I had a terrible Nokia phone for a while that would play gentle, increasingly complex but softly tentative string sounds which I really liked - but that was the only thing the device was good for. My current phone is good in all the many ways the Nokia was bad, but it tends to wake me up with a bit less sophistication. So when I heard an interesting sound in a movie, I decided to try turning it into an alarm for my phone. You'd be amazed, or perhaps you wouldn't, at how easily one can turn a Hollywood DVD into a ringtone if you apply the right pieces of hackery (rather than just record the noise coming out of the speakers I mean). But it's no good; the sound that seemed interesting and pleasantly hooty in my living room seems troubling and creepy when I'm fast asleep. If anyone can tell me what the sound is they can win a glorious prize (which I will not name as it might be too much of a clue to the answer) <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/sound.mp3"">The first thing I hear.</a>","","","","","2007-11-14","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

[excellent! set in a world of snow!]","Corvus

    'Get up, lad. You'll freeze to death like this.' 
    Zach raises his head. His skin and lips are already numb, and his nostrils packed with ice crystals. The splint and dressing after they'd broken his nose had not felt much different - a foreign body, one which he'd welcomed as a constant reminder. He'd flushed the painkillers down the clinic loo. And six months later, one of the blokes needed an implant for the four front teeth he'd lost; a few weeks afterwards, the second one spent ten days in intensive care; and the third would likely never father a child. 
    Zach can't open his eyes. With his gloved hands, fisted like a small child's, he attempts to rub them free, but his lids are iced shut by a thin glaze of frozen snow. It frightens him, that feeling of resistance, as if someone had used catgut to stitch away the evidence of his genetic code. 
    The man helps Zach to a sitting position. Noticing Zach's distress, the stranger crouches before him, places a hand on either side of Zach's head, and draws him close. Without any sign of disgust the man blows over first one, then the other eye, again and again, until Zach's sight is restored. The man is a smoker, Zach can smell the tobacco on his breath. 
    'Who are you?' Zach asks, blinking against the brightness. It's stopped snowing, and the tundra glitters in the moonlight. Those who are unfamiliar with the far north imagine months of winter darkness, but ice and snow have a spectral fierceness as beautiful as a dreamscape, as implacable as hatred. His training included a certain amount of required reading, which Zach in fascination had soon broadened to numerous accounts, many first-hand, of expeditions to the high arctic - of explorers and whalers, of scientists and entrepreneurs, of madmen and dreamers. 
    'Here they call me Lev.'
    Lev draws Zach to his feet, then reaches into a deep flapped pocket and brings out a small flask, which once uncapped, steams and gave off the rich smell of coffee. Lev holds it to Zach's lips. 
    'Slowly now, don't burn your tongue.'
    The coffee is bitter black and very sweet, laced with what might be cardamom in the Saudi style. Fleetingly Zach wonders whether Mishaal has had a hand in the programming; he always likes to leave his version of a calling card. A few sips, and heat blossoms in Zach's stomach like a spurt of blood from a reopened wound, and his shivering subsides. 
    'OK?' Lev asks.
    Zach nods.
    Lev points towards a group of willows. Low-growing like most arctic trees, they crouch in a small valley where a gleam of aquamarine suggests ice - perhaps a frozen pond or river. As Zach peers at the trees, a snow-covered building comes into focus. A hut or shed of some kind. And yes, now he can see a wisp of smoke rising from what must be a chimney. 
    'It's nearer than it looks,' Lev says, 'but we'd best get started. This cold will kill you faster than a terr bomb.'
    'Is Lev a nickname?' Zach asks. 'It's not on my client list.' 
    'Not exactly. But conserve your energy - the first rule of survival here. We'll talk once inside.'

Humanity's indomitable spirit - a case in point. Remember my stupid wireless headset for my phone? Well, it's coming in very handy now. You might also recall I can only use it when there's no one else around because it's idiotic looking. Well, that's fine because this in particular scenario I'm sat at home on my sofa.

The problem? Moving to the countryside means that the mobile-phone waves struggle to penetrate the dense foliage and the heavy pelts of the nearby animals, meaning that I hardly get a signal when I'm at home. The solution? Hang my phone in a little plastic bag on the doorknob in the one position where it works properly. Then retire to the sofa wearing a blue-flashing bluetooth head-dress for recumbent phoning luxury, as suggested by the following rather fancifully-interpretive marketing picture.","<img alt=""manonht820.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/manonht820.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""290"" />

Of course I could use my home phone - or Skype - but it's a matter of principle. Orange (my phone provider) got in touch to tell me I could nominate one other Orange user and I could call that person as much as I liked and for as long as I liked for free! Hurray! Well, most of my calls are to Em so I chose her. And then a week later I moved to the countryside where I could only get a phone signal by pressing my face up against the glass of the door. It's almost as though Orange knew. And even more coincidentally, Em took up a similar offer, choosing me as her freebie phone buddy, and also found that her new country home would only let her make calls when she pressed her head to the window. 

So picture us both, saying 'Sorry I can't hear you' as we jammed our heads into a corner. It was more restrictive than a regular home phone, because at least then you have a curly cord that lets you nod or adjust your sitting position without cutting you off.

But I'm determined to get my free calls, and I'm determined to be comfortable as I do so, even if it means I have to wear pulsing blue lights on my head. So take that, Mother Nature, with your beautiful phone-unfriendly vistas and your signal-absorbent majesty.","","","","2007-11-17","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I suppose I didn't really say in that <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/11/does_not_compute.html"">last post about copyright</a> how it relates to books. On the one hand, you probably don't expect most of what I say to have anything to do with publishing by now. On the other, maybe you can guess what I was thinking. I should spell it out, though.","The first things that got transmitted over the internet were pieces of text. In fact, in the Olden Days of The Internet, you had to use programs like uuencode to turn anything besides words that you wanted to transmit - like say an image - into a code made up of letters so that it could travel over the special magic text-only wires of the 'net. A small image might take up as much space as several pages of text, so it put more of a strain on the capacity of the early internet. Next was audio, things like MP3 files. A three minute song might take up as much space as a hundred images or a couple of novels worth of words (though by now the internet had become the web and it could handle any sort of file, not just words). The trickiest things to send over the wires (so far) are moving pictures. If you took a movie on DVD and copied the ones-and-zeroes over to those old 3.5"" floppies (remember them) you'd need four or five thousand of them. Hence live internet radio sounds fine but live internet TV doesn't really exist.

What that all means is that as computers and the web have got faster, images are all over the place and even music is very easy to download - so much so that CD sales are tanking - but swapping movies over the 'net is still something that takes forever and only teenagers can be bothered with. But don't forget, the thing that's easiest of all to swap is text, like, say, a novel. Downloading the zipped up text of a novel from Gutenberg might take a lot less than a second. So why isn't the book trade freaking out like the music companies and the movie studios are? Why aren't they suing everyone and lobbying for changes to the law and hiring brigades of IP lawyers and forcing Microsoft et al to keep adding copy-protection and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management"">DRM</a> locks to their computer software? The main reason - really the only important reason - is that good electronic paper is difficult to make while paper paper isn't. 

I listened to Mariella Frostrup totally fail to understand this concept on Radio 4 the other day. When confronted with the idea of a book that you repeatedly download fresh text into, she could only imagine that the idea was to print out the new pages on your home printer. But it's difficult to imagine a world in which it's both cheap and practical to print out our own books. Much more likely is that a handheld electronic device will do such a good job of replacing or emulating a paper book that for ordinary mainstream novels an electronic version will do fine for the majority of readers. And that's when all this hoo-ha (sp?) about fair use and copying and illegal downloads suddenly applies to publishing: when every novel in print, including your entire back-list, is available for free download from pirate sites to anyone who knows how to do a Google search. Newspapers are already getting a taste of this. And if we lock our electronic books up in the hopes that pirates won't be able to break the locks (which they will) we'll also stop people lending each other books or selling them secondhand. Potentially, our authors might be read by a hundred times as many readers, hardly any of whom pay for the privilege. In the world of music, this is leading to bands using albums as marketing for their live shows. Whether there's an equivalent for authors it's difficult to say. But for publishers I think it will either mean putting lots of effort into enforcement and generally being thought of as heavyhanded money-grabbers or putting some creative effort into completely new ways to make money from writing.","","","","2007-11-18","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

I just looked outside on the way to get a cup of tea. It's snowing! The garden and the field is covered in snow! How's about that. Sadly I have to drive to London tomorrow, otherwise I would have made a snowman. Maybe it won't stick, anyway.

So, Amazon (US) are launching an e-book reader with one of those looks-like-paper screens similar to the one the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Reader#PRS-505"">Sony e-Reader</a> has. It's called <a href=""http://www.news.com/Amazon-to-debut-Kindle-e-book-reader-Monday/2100-1025_3-6218828.html?tag=nefd.pop"">Kindle</a>. Personally I think it looks rubbish - aesthetically I mean - and that screen looks a bit murky too, but you can't really tell from the available photos. I suppose the main thing is that it's Amazon who are doing it. That means they're not likely to run out of pennies or decide they don't care about the future of books any time soon. Interestingly, this one will have a data connection (like the one in your mobile phone that you never use) which will let it download new e-books on the move - and as I understand it, Amazon will pay the phone bills for that.

Just a little addendum to talk of e-book readers. Sometimes people who haven't seen an electrophoretic display assume that it looks like the display on a phone. But they're not the same at all.

<a href=""http://meandmybigmouth.typepad.com/scottpack/2007/11/songs-that-make.html"">Scott </a>recently did a Songs that Make You Cry post, which has inspired this post. I simply can't hold back the tears when I read Oscar Wilde's The Nightingale and the Rose.","THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE ROSE

She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses, cried the young Student; but in all my garden there is no red rose.
From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.
No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears. Ah, on what little things does happiness depend! I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.
Here at last is a true lover, said the Nightingale. Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him. His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.
The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night, murmured the young Student, and my love will be of the company. If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn. If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine. But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by. She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.
Here indeed is the true lover, said the Nightingale. What I sing of, he sufferswhat is joy to me, to him is pain. Surely Love is a wonderful thing. It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace. It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.
The musicians will sit in their gallery, said the young Student, and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin. She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her. But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.
Why is he weeping? asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.
Why, indeed? said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.
Why, indeed? whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.
He is weeping for a red rose, said the Nightingale.
For a red rose? they cried; how very ridiculous! and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.
But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Students sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.
Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.
In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.
Give me a red rose, she cried, and I will sing you my sweetest song.
But the Tree shook its head.
My roses are white, it answered; as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain. But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.
So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.
Give me a red rose, she cried, and I will sing you my sweetest song.
But the Tree shook its head.
My roses are yellow, it answered; as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe. But go to my brother who grows beneath the Students window, and perhaps he will give you what you want.
So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Students window.
Give me a red rose, she cried, and I will sing you my sweetest song.
But the Tree shook its head.
My roses are red, it answered, as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern. But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.
One red rose is all I want, cried the Nightingale, only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it?
There is away, answered the Tree; but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you.
Tell it to me, said the Nightingale, I am not afraid.
If you want a red rose, said the Tree, you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own hearts-blood. You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn. All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine.
Death is a great price to pay for a red rose, cried the Nightingale, and Life is very dear to all. It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl. Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill. Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?
So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.
The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.
Be happy, cried the Nightingale, be happy; you shall have your red rose. I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own hearts-blood. All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty. Flame- coloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body. His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense.
The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.
But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.
Sing me one last song, he whispered; I shall feel very lonely when you are gone.
So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.
When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.
She has form, he said to himself, as he walked away through the grovethat cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling? I am afraid not. In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without any sincerity. She would not sacrifice herself for others. She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish. Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice. What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good. And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.
And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn. All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened. All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.
She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl. And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song. Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the riverpale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn. As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.
But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn. Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, or the Day will come before the rose is finished.
So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.
And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride. But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the roses heart remained white, for only a Nightingales hearts-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.
And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn. Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, or the Day will come before the rose is finished.
So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her. Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.
And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky. Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.
But the Nightingales voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes. Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.
Then she gave one last burst of music. The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky. The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air. Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams. It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.
Look, look! cried the Tree, the rose is finished now; but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.
And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.
Why, what a wonderful piece of luck! he cried; here is a red rose! I have never seen any rose like it in all my life. It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name; and he leaned down and plucked it.
Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professors house with the rose in his hand.
The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.
You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose, cried the Student. Here is the reddest rose in all the world. You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.
But the girl frowned.
I am afraid it will not go with my dress, she answered; and, besides, the Chamberlains nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.
Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.
Ungrateful! said the girl. I tell you what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you? Only a Student. Why, I dont believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlains nephew has; and she got up from her chair and went into the house.
What I a silly thing Love is, said the Student as he walked away. It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true. In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.
So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.","","","","2007-11-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Okay, so let me set the scene.  I know that the American school system is often seen as failing  ruled by standardized tests, undemanding, more concerned with getting everybody through than with actual education, and so on.  Im not really concerned with whether or not you agree with this assessment; I feel that its generally correct today, that it was just as accurate when I was in school.

But there are exceptions, teachers who manage to engage their students and impart actual knowledge.  I had such a teacher in high school, for Honours Composition (we, of course, called it <i>Honors Composition</i>, because we were in America).  This teacher was something of a legend in our school district; the rumours began in junior high: weekly vocabulary quizzes, grammar tests, the impossibility of a perfect score on an essay.","Each semester, this teacher would begin class by describing the appropriate format for papers.  Hed draw a diagram on the blackboard and point to the parts.  This was where your name and class information should be, exactly one third of the way down the page, centred.  The little line in the top corner?  That was the staple; note how it was parallel with the top of the page, not diagonal.  

He expected students to moan about the rigidity of these requirements (failure to comply with staple alignment could result in lost percentage points, after all), so he pre-empted the complaints with a simple explanation.  <i>This is the format I require, and if you want full points, this is how youll do it.</i>  Lest that sound too much like a parent shouting because I said so, his explanation went on: <i>If you were writing an article for </i>National Geographic<i>, they would have their own requirements.  If you dont follow them, your piece wont get considered.</i>  I dont know why the publication in question was always <i>National Geographic</i>, but it was.  He was always very consistent on that point (and all others).

Anyway, the same rules applied to grammar in our essays.  It was he who taught us this grammar in the first place, so he knew we should have learned it and therefore could be pretty merciless.  Each mistake was a percentage point lost.  Missed out a comma?  99%  Didnt spot that (obvious) typo on the second page?  98%  Is that a preposition <i>at the end of a sentence</i>?  Christ alive.  97%  And so on.

There was no excuse for not knowing basic grammar, and why would you expect anybody to waste their time on something you couldnt even be bothered to proofread properly?

And that  surprise!  brings us to the present.  

I spent about twelve hours yesterday reading submissions.  Okay, I took a few breaks.  But whenever I go on a bender like that, I wind up frustrated and confused.  I generally try to give each submission a real chance to impress me, but I have to admit to rejecting some after the first paragraph.  The errors!  The typos!  <i>Why would they expect me to waste my time on something they couldnt be bothered to proofread properly?</i>

The answer is that you cannot.  I <i>wont</i> waste my time on something that shows a lack of effort.  Now, Im not as particular as my teacher was.  Theres a lot of prescriptive grammar out there that just doesnt make sense these days.  I dont actually care about prepositions at the ends of sentences.  Got a bucket of infinitives?  Split away.  Grammar should aid clarity, right?  

And a lot comes down to context.  Ill forgive most mistakes in a blog post  Ill <i>make</i> mistakes in a blog post!  I generally will make an effort to use the right words and spell things correctly in an e-mail, because thats what sounding like an intelligent person is all about, but I wont go to pains to find the perfect phrases.  Ive even been known to skip capital letters altogether when I instant message.  So everything in its proper time and place.

But whether it was my high school indoctrination or just a general tendency towards being anal and humourless, I cannot for the life of me fathom how a person can finish a novel and start sending it out before theyve checked it through for errors.  Particularly when there is <i>so much</i> writing out there for publishers to choose from.  Is that really the best first impression a writer can make?  Hello, I would like to work with you.  Sadly, Im a little bit lazy and so havent taken the time to correct the most obvious of typos, but I hope that wont get in the way of what could be a beautiful relationship.

Sometimes I stop myself and realize that, wait, not everybody had the excellent teachers I had.  Not everybody fell in love with linguistics in college.  Maybe they just dont <i>know</i> theyre making huge mistakes, eh?  Who can blame them for that?

But wait!  Wait again!  These are writers.  Maybe not published authors, possibly not even that experienced, but these are people who want me to look at their work and say, You are a writer, look what you have written.  I like it and wish to publish it!  (Incidentally, thats not my actual line when we accept a book for publication  UNTIL NOW!)  And if theres one thing a writer has to be good at, its writing.

<i>No, man, its all about story telling!  Youre harshing my mellow with your talk of grammar and rules.  Get off my back!</i>

True enough, right?  Story tellings the important part, isnt it?  But heres the thing:  there are venues for storytelling.  There are groups who get together and stand on stages and stories burst forth from their mouths and its amazing and glorious.  Ive been there, Ive heard it.  So if thats what youre after, do it.  Go there and revel in your streams of consciousness and throw all the rules out the window.

However, if you want to turn that story into a novel, one thats published in book form for a wide and varied audience to read, its not enough to be just a story-teller.  You need to learn to be a writer.  Surprisingly, that might really mean <i>learning</i> something.  Like what a comma is for.  When to use a semi colon.  The difference between <i>who</i> and <i>whom</i> (aaiiieeeee!).

The problem is that we use language in our everyday lives, so we figure we must know enough to have a go at this writing thing.  But can you imagine dabbling in anything else  trying to turn it into an earner if not a career, as I suppose our submitters are doing  without doing a bit of research?  I live in a house; I even take care of it.  I use the basement stairs every day, right, but that doesnt mean Im ready to be a builder.

So I dont really see ignorance as an excuse when it comes to this stuff.  If I had the time, money, and inclination, Id send back at least half our submissions with a copy of Strunk and Whites <i>The Elements of Style</i> and a note saying Try again.  But I dont, partly because of that time and money stuff, but also, as I mentioned before, theres <i>so much</i> out there.  

I think people understand that theyre up against steep competition  or at least an awful lot of it.  But most people would never bother submitting if they didnt think they had a chance, and if they have <i>a</i> chance, maybe they have a pretty good chance, so lets just chuck em this manuscript and see what happens, eh?  There are so many ways to judge a submission, from originality to interesting characters to our old friend story-telling.  To craftsmanship (which is where grammar and language fall).

Everything needs to be in balance and needs to be <i>good</i> for a manuscript to be considered.  The thing about grammar is that you cant hide it.  Ive got nearly to the end of a submission before only to discover that the plot wasnt as strong as Id hoped it would be.  By that point, Id become so invested in the story and the characters that maybe I was willing to work with the author, to give over some of my time in the hope that we could create something I could publish.  Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesnt.  

But bad grammar just sits there.  It sits at the beginning of your novel, it sits at the end, and its packed so tightly in between the two that Ill never get past it.  Bad grammar sings out its crappy song, begging to be noticed at every turn.  I havent got time for that, not when other people have gone to the effort, at some point in their lives, to learn what makes good writing good.

Even if you dont care a lick about what Ive just said (but well done you for reading it all, if thats the case!), if grammar just pure-and-simple doesnt apply to you, but youre still going to submit because nobody can resist your rambling sentences and esoteric wit  nobody!  please learn at least one thing (or two er, three) for me:

Learn what makes a traditional sentence  subject, verb  very basic.  Learn to identify when you have joined up these sorts of clauses into compound sentences (and when you have not).  Learn how to use a comma to separate these clauses.  I didnt have to wait for an amazing high school teacher to learn this stuff, and Im willing to bet you didnt either.  So please refresh your memory.

Grammar isnt tricky, but you cant count on your instincts for the prescriptive stuff.  Maybe you think only bossy nerds would waste their time caring about all this, and perhaps thats true.  But Im the bossy nerd with my finger on the reject button.","","","","2007-11-20","2013-03-29","","","","Anna","3"

Because technology gets invented by people who specialise in it, there does seem to be a bit of a lag between something being invented and ordinary folk finding out about it and figuring out what they think of it. Just to pick an example, people started eating genetically modified food some time before they knew what it was and whether they approved of it. And in that particular 'debate' (if that's the word) Britain baulked and America shrugged.

With that sort of thing in mind, now really is the time to figure out what we all think about fair use when it comes to things like books, music and DVDs.

It is, of course, a list of requirements that no device in the foreseeable span of future human achievement will ever attain. Probably the only reason that I like it is that he left off '15) has to smell as good or better than a paper book'. To me, that's such a big concession that I can almost accept '3) It will be able to survive... falling completely into two or more pieces, while still remaining perfectly readable afterwards'.","","","","","2007-11-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

If I'm writing anything, I try to back it up a lot. I don't understand people who lose entire manuscripts without at least <em>trying</em> to maintain a copy somewhere safe. And when I saw the trinket in the picture, that's what I thought of. Not so much for myself, you understand, but perhaps for those writers of the female persuasion who like the shiny. You can carry a copy of your novel-in-progress around your neck - or maybe the finished article in case you meet a potential publisher socially (perish the thought). In case it's not clear, it's a Swarovski crystal pendant with a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive"">USB flash drive</a> built in. (For anyone able to parse this sentence: I gakked it from <a href=""http://www.boingboing.net/2007/11/21/crystalenhanced-usb.html"">boingboing</a>.) More details <a href=""http://active-crystals.com/"">here</a> (but be warned, the site insists on animating and setting to music everything it possibly can, because as any good marketing person will tell you, we all love to be irritated unnecessarily).","Further thoughts:

1) I love how the thing looks slightly asymmetric as though its creator was a jewellery design major who had a minor in anatomy. <em>Hmmm. Since one side of the heart only pumps to the lungs, it should be smaller.</em>

2) Perhaps the Society of Authors could commission their own exclusive flash drive necklaces. They could be (gasp) even more tasteful than the Swarovski ones. And whenever you saw someone wearing one you'd know you'd met a fellow scribbler.","","","","2007-11-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

You might want to buy (or read over someone's shoulder on the bus) this Sunday's Observer. I think I'm going to be in it. On a list. So look for lists. I think it will just be one line. I don't know. And as I understand it the publication is full of other information, news, and whatnot so you won't have to fork out just for a few lines about me. I think there's a crossword, too. Value for money, right there. 

What I do know is there might be a bottle of cognac in it for me. Mmmm.","","","","","2007-11-23","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

I have been ill most of this week. Yes, I know, I am a brave soldier for appearing so chipper on the blog, and for doing thousands of hours of work without hardly a complaint. You may gasp in awe at my amazingness. 

The reason I mention it is that I feel a bit better now. And I think I know why. I have just had my first coffee in three weeks. I am a coffee addict, I think (certainly a big fan, at least), and was drinking more than ten cups a day - until three Saturdays ago when I decided to go cold turkey. It wasn't too bad. I switched to boring old tea, and didn't feel tired or anything. But this week, I think the lack of coffee plus a bug has floored me. 

So. Back on the coffee - for health reasons. Can't say I didn't try.","","","","","2007-11-23","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

While having my lunchtime soup, I listened to Cory Doctorow being interviewed. He was talking about why he doesn't think e-book readers will really catch on. His reasons were a little bit depressing, and the diametric opposite of what most commenters on this blog seem to think.","Of course you have to remember that Cory is a sci-fi author, so you can't really use the argument that readers are traditionalists with him - because his readers certifiably aren't. But instead of appealing to the rich sense-experience of paper books, he looks at the big picture. His thinking is two-fold: firstly, reading novels isn't that popular. Reading for pleasure is a minority interest these days. The big money goes into video games and iPods, etc; So there won't be any big drive for technology to conquer the book world, because it's too small to justify the effort. His second argument is that any device that's capable of being a good reader for books will inevitably get loaded up with other features: games, a web browser, a music player, a phone, a video player and so on. And the one thing we know about those features is that they are all more popular with the average citizen than reading. And stripping those features out isn't going to work, because why would you buy the e-book reader that just displays books when someone else is offering one that does all those other things? And given the option to do those other things, we know that most people will choose them over reading. His argument is that paper books help you not to get distracted in a way that no gadget with a screen ever will. Listen <a href=""http://hbpub.vo.llnwd.net/o16/torpodcast/media/tor_podcast_083107_cbr.mp3"">here</a> for the full interview. But the summary is that he's agreeing with all the naysayers out there, but probably for reasons you'll hate.","","","","2007-11-23","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

The list I mentioned a few weeks ago that I'm on: this is it. Britain's top new talent, and all that. Looks like I'm the only publisher on there (oh no, I'm not - Toby Mundy and Jon Wood, too. OK, only female publisher), which is nice. There's a supplement in today's Observer announcing it, but don't rush out on my account - the only mention I get is 'Emma Barnes, Snowbooks' MD' and I think you know that already. 

But it's quite neat - I get access to an interesting forum with the other 499 people, which is a stroke of genius. The organisers get to tell advertisers that they have an exclusive audience of 500 movers and shakers, and so the ads cost more. The Future 500 people get free stuff and good deals. Everyone's a winner. The best thing I've found so far is one of those trend presentations - I love that sort of thing and I'll be adapting it for Snowbooks' purposes and will share bits of it here with you. When I get a mo. Today, though, I'm trying to learn enough XSLT to take 70 ONIX records and turn them into simpler XML that InDesign can cope with without having a nervous breakdown. To the computer!

Susan Carver's first novel focusses on the enduring effect of attachment and loss experienced in childhood. She is a therapist and academic .

Half in Love

At thirty-nine, Dr Anna Ballinger slides into a midlife crisis. Her father, who died at the same age, guides her back - from 'beyond the grave' or her own subconscious?","Half in love 

   It was a harmless enough habit, thought Anna Ballinger. This secret trick of hers for making the world recede a little, as opposed to a lot - when she meditated - or fading it out completely, during sex. After all, she might have taken to strong drink or to whatever it was that Mrs Robinson kept in her pantry with her cup cakes. 
   Hugging herself, she scanned syllables, pressing her fingertips into the flesh of her slim upper arms as if playing scales on a piano, until the annoying, lame jingle began to resonate. Bouncing to music that jars with my mood...hardly a novel experience...dudepseudprude?
   She settled for dude, played the couplets three times over and stopped, letting sensations bombard her again. The atmosphere in the seedily lit basement where she sat with her husband, Tim, on their preferred banquette, was sultry and charged with cigarette smoke - as usual. Strident, modern jazz blared, just as it always did, towards the end of the house bands first set on a Saturday night, above voices which had long since blended into white noise.
    A little truth in the pathetic jingle? She gave a faint, wry smile and closed her eyes. An image of Will, one of her clients, white-knuckled and staring - at nothing - popped up again, like Jack from his box. She edged along the banquette, absent-mindedly trying to escape the bouncing, her right hand flying from a rent in the red leatherette. 
     She felt Tims hand on her arm, caressing her. 
   You OK Annie?
   She smiled up at him, blinking mist from her eyes.
   Yeah fine. 
   Sure? 
   She slid back towards him.
   Finding it a bit hard to switch off actually. Rather a heavy week.
   Come on now, we cant have that, not on a Saturday night. 
   He put his arm around her and she nestled in. Keeping her close, he reached for his wineglass.
   Taking her with him, Tim leaned across to pull a wine bottle from an ice bucket. The neck hovering over her glass, he smiled at her, arching his dark eyebrows.
   No thanks. 
    He filled his glass to just below the rim, draining the bottle.
   Why dont I get us a bottle of red?
   Dont think so, not if you want me to get you home in one piece.   
   The good humour draining from his face, he let go of her and upended the bottle in the ice bucket, making water slop over the sides. 
   She glanced around. Without the devils decor, this place would have all the charm of an industrial unit, she thought, finding herself outside of her own experience again; a trait of hers she had become almost fond of; knowing it dated all the way back to the bright January morning when her childhood world had tilted on its axis.  Her long dead father was often in her thoughts these days; she put it down to the approach of her fortieth birthday - an age he hadnt, quite, reached.

Oh, that Seth Godin. He really is awfully smart. His <a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/11/the-caricature.html"">latest post </a>is about caricatures. He says that police have better luck finding suspects using caricatures than boring sketches, because a caricature falsely highlights various anomalies while diminishing the boring parts. And he suggests that it works that way for brands, too. The examples he gives are excellent: 

""During the formative days of Fedex, the caricature was that their drivers would even rent a helicopter to get just one package delivered on time. It's easy to turn Starbucks' variety and focus on your needs into a caricature as well, ""half-caf, extra hot, short macchiato, extra foam, with soy, in a ceramic mug....""""

So I thought I'd have a go at caricaturing Snowbooks.","On retailer relations: 
[in posh voice] ""Hi, darling! You're looking so young, so fabulous! I love what you've done with your shop front! Here, have 80% discount. No, honestly, it's fine. In fact, make it 85%. Ah, hell - I'll pay you to take it! Here's a blank cheque. It's on me.""

On author relations: 
[in sergeant major voice] ""Oi! You there! NO! Submit your work in Word 2009 with 3mm indents on EVERY OTHER PARAGRAPH. Wait... what is this? COMIC SANS! Drop and give me forty!""

On editorial direction:
[in rapid, nervous Woody Allen voice] ""OK, so, we've got these books on zombies, ok, but now we need crafts, yeah, some crafts, OK got the crafts now we need boxing! Yeah, and sci fi, and historical fiction, and some edgy stuff, ok, got the edgy stuff, now we need literature, great, collectable, ok, now how about some, oh, I dunno, spot welding or something. [pant, pant]""

On IT:
[in nasal boffin voice] ""Proceed to output the XML file and execute a processing sequence using opensource cooktop software, by parsing the XML via XSL to form an XHTML file, being merely well formed XML, attached to a subsequent CSS file and so achieving [snorts through nose] various and all e-commerce compliance targets.""

On working practices:
[in whispering David Attenborough voice] ""The publisher sits...in her natural habitat. She barely moves, conserving heat and energy for the cold months ahead. The only sign of life are the fingers moving rapidly across her territory, which make a tell-tale tapping sound to alert other publishers nearby to her presence. She will sit like this for up to 20 hours on end, all the while producing the tapping to retain, in her dialect, 'competitive advantage'.""","","","","2007-11-27","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Shirley is a teacher turned writer, who loves French poetry, chocolate and cats. This is her first full-length novel, currently seeking a publisher. Honestly!
 
How Do I Tell You? is a story about lies. Like placebo tablets, they make you feel better. After a lifetime of deception, Katherine wonders about revealing the truth.","How Do I Tell You?
 
Deep breath. That's better. Now just write the words. 
 
I am a compulsive and habitual liar. 
 
There, I've done it. Externalised the big secret and made it real. Fifty-odd years down the track, and I've confessed, owned up to the hollow heart of me, that lies fall from my tongue more readily than truths. They always have done, and I suspect they always will do. They fly from my lips like tiny birds in a blur of fluttering wings, blue, green, yellow. Like budgerigars, they chatter and hop and dazzle. There is no contradiction about admitting this truth. I'm quite capable of candour, when it suits me. Indeed, I suspect most people who know me would agree: I am entirely to be trusted, what you see is what you get, honest as the day is long. Although much of the time, it isn't, is it?
 
Goodness, I feel light-headed. That wasn't as difficult as I'd feared. The burden of a lifetime, dropped with relative ease, and now my shoulders can relax. What a strange sensation. Makes me wonder why I carried the load for so long. 
 
Half a century telling lies.
 
Of course, I'm not talking about the everyday fib, as in Do you like my new hairdo? Lovely, really suits you, which my mother used to call a white lie. Tactful, polite. The bad spookily become good, like white witchcraft. No. It's more the elaborate misdirection, to confuse the credulous and put them off the scent. You have to ask yourself how best to offer to others the opportunity to believe you. That is, after all, what they, to trust rather than distrust. 
 
As a teenager, I used to feel schizophrenic trying to maintain two identities, both of which were completely me but were often at odds with one another. People thought I was such a good girl, too. The words made me cringe. But I worked hard to preserve the illusion, until it became a self-fulfilling prophesy, so that as far as family, teachers, friends and neighbours were concerned, I really was a good girl. I appeared to conform, I epitomised the stereotype with which they were all so anxious to cloak me. After a lifetime of wearing that cloak, I wonder sometimes who I might have been, had not the shadow become the substance. 
 
To be a good liar, you have to be able to think fast, to think on your feet. You always look the enemy in the eye, without blinking, never mising a second or a heartbeat, just seamless, nonchalant continuity. One hesitation and you're done for. Literally. I've since thought I should have been an actress. Professionally, that is. At least I could have been paid for what I do so well. 
 
A problem occurs to me already, and I've barely started. Despite my earlier denial, I have inevitably set up a logical paradox, haven't I? If it is true that I always tell lies, then can anything I say be believed? Ah well, let the reader beware.

It seems like we're always linking to something that <a href=""http://worryfriends.com/"">Leila</a> (author of <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005758.html"">How To Worry Friends and Inconvenience People</a>) has done. This time, though, I want to link to a story her beau, Tom, has written for the Guardian. It's <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/nov/29/research"">here</a>.  It's  a piece about a young computer-science whiz. Now I may be doing you all a disservice, but I always tend to imagine that the sort of people who'd read a publishing blog spent more time in the English Department than the Science Block at school. But even if that's true, maybe you wondered what they got up to over there. One of the nice things about the story Tom is picking up on is that it's also about Stephen Wolfram - and Stephen Wolfram thinks that a good deal of the science that came out of the twentieth-century was headed into a cul-de-sac, and that it would never be able to explain most of the things we see in nature. If nothing else, that certainly justifies any time you spent reading novels when you could have been playing with bunsen burners.","Wolfram, because he's so modest, suggests an alternative starting point for science. His idea is that lots of simple things out there in the world can act like very primitive computers. Remember all that stuff from the Eighties about Chaos Theory? People thought that simple things behaved in simple ways, and then it turned out that even working out when the next drip was going to fall from a dripping tap could be a complex mathematical undertaking. Well, Wolfram realised that lots of things in nature could be so finely balanced that they were very sensitive to their environment, reacting differently depending on what was going on around them. And if you thought of the environment as 'input' and you thought of what happened next as 'the output', then what you'd got in a lot of natural systems were very simple calculating machines. And if nature was full of ultra-simple calculating machines, it made sense to do a bit more research on what super-simple computers were capable of. At which point Wolfram realised hardly anyone had ever bothered with that research because they hadn't expected to find anything interesting. 

So Wolfram invented lots of imaginary and very basic computers - computers so simple you wouldn't even call them computers - because all they did was follow incredibly simple rules. And he found all sorts of extraordinary things. If you take the output from one of these primitive computers and feed it back in, then you could generate astoundingly complex behaviour from a set of rules that weren't much more complicated than the rules for noughts and crosses.

Why is any of that interesting? Well, if nature is full of tiny calculating machines - and twentieth-century science has been ignoring the study of ultra-simple computers in order to do lots of complicated differential calculus, then to a large extent science has been missing the point of... well, of science. And the proof mentioned in Tom's article - if it holds up - demonstrates that it's possible to create a fully functional computer, one that could in principle run Excel and Tomb Raider, from a design that's much simpler than any computer anyone else has ever conceived of. If something that acts like a computer can be made from simpler components than anyone thought possible, it might be a step towards proving that nature really is full of tiny, super-simple computers.  Which means that your grandkids might be ignoring a completely different kind of science as they bypass the Science Block to head to the English Department.","","","","2007-11-29","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

I've just been doing a bit of writing. Nothing too unusual in that. My day-job of posting little graphics on the Snowblog doesn't fill the <em>entire</em> day, and the rest of the time I either look out of the window or write stories. No, not 'like a child would'. Honestly, show some respect!

What's been a little weird about this most recent writing project is that it's been so structured... and not by me. It needed to be a certain size, it had to be finished in a fraction of the time I'd normally spend on something like this and for various reasons it ideally needed to fit in the gap left by some things I'd already written. Oh, and when I sat done to zip through this thing I didn't even have a story in mind (as far as I could tell). That in itself is weird, because why would you sit down to write unless you had a story to tell?","Anyway, the thing is that I'm not too unhappy with the results. (For anyone who's interested in the details I'll probably write a little post with more info in a little while.) But I didn't have to break any of my own rules of storytelling; I didn't have to fudge anything; and whether the end result is popular or not, I don't think I'll be too embarrassed by it (though if everyone hates it I might keep mentioning how little time I had to write it). All in all, it's made me wonder how far I could push this writing 'to order' idea. So I was sitting here thinking about what I'd write next if my only motivation was to  be able to afford a nice holiday, or maybe some new double-glazing. So what do you reckon? What's the most commercial thing I could possibly sit down and write? I'm not for a moment saying I'd do it, but then again you never know. I am blessed/cursed with quite mainstream tastes. I wouldn't have any artistic objection to writing a techno-thriller or a book about dragons or a rom-com. Which is another way of saying that I wouldn't necessarily hate the material. So any suggestions? You're not allowed to put forward celebrity biographies - not unless there's a market for fake ones - but what else do you think is going to be enslaving the reading public's eyeballs in 2008? 

As a special bonus, if I am able to buy a big millionaire's boat with the proceeds, then anyone who makes a suggestion can come for a ride on it. The author of the winning suggestion can steer for a while and wear the captain's hat. And maybe have a small bag of my spare money.","","","","2007-12-01","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

I really can't tell you how much I've enjoyed a TV series called Industrial Revelations by Mark Williams. Even if you can't place the name, you'd know him as soon as you saw him. He's one of the luminaries from The Fast Show and Mr Weasley from the Harry Potter movies (if you've heard of them).

As you can guess from the title, it's about the industrial revolution. The first season is all about heavy industry: coal, steam, canals, trains. The second is about peripheral bits and pieces like cloth-making and printing and mining. It's not flashy, it's not even particularly innovative, but there's something about Mark Williams's enthusiasm that's completely absorbing.","Partly I think it's the fact that he knows what he's talking about. I don't know if he ever studied engineering, but he's certainly got a passion for it. And he's not one of those dreadful bouncy presenters using their acting skills to fake interest in something. He's an enormously likable and interesting fellow who's eager to share his excitement for some pivotal industrial history. The shows look like they were made for thruppence, but they're the best thing I've seen for ages. It doesn't matter if you're not particularly fascinated by machinery (especially if you choose to watch the second season) because he's also explaining how people's lives changed and how fortunes were made, and chances are he's doing it from inside some giant piece of beautiful Victorian engineering. There's something there for everyone. If you can get hold of it on DVD - and for some reason that's not always straightforward - I really can't recommend it highly enough. Would make a top Christmas present.

Amazon claim to have season one <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000SKKCLE/026-6642924-8006009"">here</a>. Not sure if season two is on DVD yet.

Well, I say work. I did try to have some time away from a computer last weekend, but it made me nervous and fidgety. So, like the coffee, this weekend I've been back at my laptop, and loving it.","I have done three tremendous things. Firstly, I read Rob's superb new book. I am very excited about it, and more on that in the near future. 

Secondly, I wrote a website. It's an important website, and I wanted to get it right - but I had a lot of fun with it because Wordpress Is So Bloody Super. I'll tell you more next week. 

Thirdly, I cracked a thing in XSLT that I've been foiled by for the last forever. I won't bore you with the details, but I've figured out how to get selected bibliographic data for selected titles to import into Indesign in one fell swoop - crucial for catalogues. Previously, I could only figure out how to do it one title at a time, which is laborious. Not any more! Works like a charm, mainly thanks to <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beginning-XSLT-2-0-Novice-Professional/dp/1590593243/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1196626246&sr=8-2"">Jeni Tennison's superb book</a>.

So whilst the things I've done are related to work, they're not really anything to do with the gazillion things I have on my to-do list. And because I am very pleased with myself for learning lots and finishing two big projects, I have this sense of having had a rest. Weird, I know.

Forgive the fuzziness* (well it was pre-coffee, after all) but I thought I'd share this packaging. How can you deny yourself Super Premium Limited Edition One Time Only Get It Whilst It's Hot? I love the blatant hyperbole - and it got me to buy. It's not bad, but I have to say I was expecting better given the marketing.

Reminds me of something I was reading the other day about modern consumerism, and the idea that you can upgrade anything. Water, coffee, loo-roll - these things used to be commodities but marketeers have created a 'supertier' offering. I have a hunch that's an area of books that isn't currently exploited - except maybe by the Folio Society - but would make sense. Someone pass me the gold leaf.

Em sent me a link to an <a href=""http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2961480.ece"">article</a> in The Times about sci-fi, its importance and its unpopularity. One of the points it makes is that if anyone manages to write really good sci-fi it instantly gets promoted out of the genre, so that Orwell's 1984 becomes political satire or simply classic literature. Anyway, while reading the article I had a very unpleasant realisation about my own future.","The realisation is in two parts. 1) Sci-Fi is very unpopular, uncool and uncommercial and 2) I have inadvertently spent most of my life training to be a sci-fi writer. I've studied physics and engineering at university and then later molecular biology, physical chemistry and genomics. I've done all sorts of technical jobs involving computers and communications. In my own time I've done my best to learn about  politics and the way economies evolve. And I've had several jobs where I had to design possible futures for big businesses.  I've also read tons of sci-fi (mainly when I was younger) and latterly I've been writing thrillers. There's no getting round it: the job I am most suited to is sci-fi writer. Oh bum.

<hr/>

Mind you, as visual effects get better and cheaper, people are going to make more and more sci-fi movies and TV shows. Maybe I'll just write screenplays and not be destitute and unpopular. Hooray!","","","","2007-12-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

For lovers of the schadenfreude frisson (and similar franco-germanically-entitled phenomena) there's a fun development in the Motion Picture Association of America's attempts to clamp down on copyright violation. It seems they're pushing hard to have some monitoring software installed on university networks to check that students aren't stepping on their copyrights. Unfortunately for them, they built their monitoring application using bits of open source software. And the licence for most open source software says that if you use the community's code, you have to make the results freely available to all. But the MPAA don't like that sort of copyright, they only like their own, so they refused to make their code available. At which point they became the recipients of one of their own favourite weapons, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA"">DMCA</a> notice. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwned""><em>Pwned</em></a>, as the net-kids say. I have to say that until copyright enforcement becomes at least as much about encouraging creativity as it is about protecting profits I can't get very excited about it.","","","","","2007-12-04","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

I'm not saying the climate is <em>broken</em>, or anything, but that rose is blooming in my garden right now. OK, it's a little tatty-looking in places, but it's the freakin' 9th of freakin' December. (I know it looks like I did a really hamfisted job of bumping the saturation up through the roof, but I swear I didn't touch the colours. That's how it came out of my D40 (with all the settings on default). I even thought of photoshopping the saturation down so this real rose would look more believable.  The weirdness probably comes from the fact that the camera decided it needed the flash to fire even though it's daylight out there.

Publishers don't just publish, so even if the world comes up with some way to get words directly from the writer's nib into some perfectly-paper-like electrophoretic e-book reader, the role of the publisher won't have gone away. But if the world also comes up with a way to figure out which raw manuscripts are wheat and which are chaff - and it bypasses the current quality filters of the agent -> publisher -> retailer supply chain - then the world <em>might</em> be on to something.","If they don't need us to recommend what to read and they don't need us to convey their chosen author's words to them, we will need to think of something else to do with our days. I tend to watch* the music industry for ideas and then think about whether they might manage to jump the gap into book-world. This 'music discovery' site (<a href=""http://www.boingboing.net/2007/12/09/thesixtyone-music-di.html"">link</a> to summary. click banner to go direct.) is interesting. Explore, rate what you find, and shape the collective verdict. Of course, 'experimenting' by listening to a new tune might take 2m40s whereas reading a novel on spec might take all day. But that's why now is a good time to think about the future, not when the kinks have been worked out and it's already happened.

* 'watch' is too active a verb. 'take note when I stumble upon facts about' might be better - what Eddie Izzard calls 'passive research'.","","","","2007-12-10","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

It reminds me of a Christmas at a retailer I worked for once, where the bestselling Christmas line, above all others, was a mug that made a farting sound when you picked it up. Troubling, as I say.

Having finished off a bit of creative writing I've been working on lately I settled down to do some programming today. Maybe it's the fact that I only write code in little fun chunks and only when I feel like it, but I always find it disappointing how enjoyable it is. Some part of me wishes I liked opera and such-like and hated computers, but really (shhh!) it's the other way round.","The thing I've been working on this morning converts information about our books into different forms. We have to produce data files to send off to Nielsen, so that all the retailers can find out about our titles, but we've written some converters that turn that same info into web pages. If you go to our online <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/catalogue.html"">catalogue</a> you can see what I mean. There's one page per title and all of them were generated automatically. The tweaks and adjustments I'm adding today just make it easier to regenerate the whole catalogue, as well as paper AIs, with a single click. So when we make a change or add a new title, that info gets to all the places it needs to with as little effort as possible. Like I say, I feel slightly disappointed that I'm enjoying writing XSLT and not sonnets, but at least this stuff is useful. It gets rid of jobs that used to take days - and it also cuts down on the number of mistakes because computers are better at copying accurately than people.

I don't suppose too many people reading this will share our enthusiasm* for automating our processes, but lately I've been wondering if there might not be a message for us in that. Maybe when we've got all this stuff set up, with the production of AIs, web catalogues, Nielsen data and e-books all automated, perhaps we'll see if we can do some of these jobs for other people too.

Lily Allen, popstrel, is one of the judges for the Orange Prize. Everyone's up in arms. I think it's bloody brilliant<span style=""color: red;"">*</span>.","Firstly, it's a stroke of marketing genius by the prize organisers. It's December, the money markets are in trouble, retail is in trouble and yet I've read more column inches about Ms Allen's new appointment than any of that. Big success from the Orange prize organisers for getting people talking about it five months early. 

Second, she's not exactly stupid. She's educated, sparkly, determined, driven, knows a thing or two about branding since she's done it to herself, and has probably read more books than me in the last year. 

Thirdly, if I'd been asked to judge a prize I would be very upset if people said I wasn't suitable, or worthwhile, or important enough. I think it's manners to be nice to someone who is going to give up a lot of her time to read - what, a hundred? Two hundred - books in a short space of time. 

Fourthly, her younger brother is called Alfie and the younger brother in Mothernight is called Alfie. Therefore she will definitely vote for it. Then there'll be a fight between Lily who will want Mothernight to win, and Phillipa Gregory who will want Needle to win. Ladies, ladies, please! Split the prize - they can *both* win. 

And finally, don't you think she's taking a bit of a gamble for her own image? Shurely it's crossed her mind that lots of her fans think writing is 'for geekz an sad pepl', as Grumpy Old Bookman's site is dedicated to. The book trade's got a hell of a lot to gain from this and she's got a lot to lose. Personally, I think a thank you is in order.

No, I'll grant you, you can't use it on a book. Or an author (at least not safely).

Now the WD-40 will go where you want it - and not just the first time - but repeatedly, even after you would normally have lost the stupid straw held on with its stupid elastic band. This feels huge.

Can you imagine writing a novel if you had to do all your edits and corrections by crossing something through and writing it out again with a pen? Can you imagine (or remember) producing photo-ready artwork for illustrated books and then physically cutting and pasting with actual cuts and actual paste in order to get your book ready to print? They used to be the only ways and now that's all vanished. It must have been an awful, colossal pain and it certainly had the effect of making sure that the contents of books stayed where you put them. It took a lot of effort to propagate words and pictures. But now that layouts are done with clicks, and editing is so easy that you can think about the words not what your hands are doing, it's easy to blur the distinction between books, magazines, online articles and other people's websites. For part of every book's life, all of its words and pictures and layout are just ones-and-zeroes. In theory, they could go anywhere next. There's no such thing as book text as compared with online text. It's all electronic, at least while it's being prepared. So I was wondering if anyone out there does unusual things with their book files. Do any of you use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docbook"">DocBook</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DITA"">DITA</a>?

I reckon that Clinton Cards will announce a profit warning in January. 

This year, I have received a handful of Xmas cards but an inbox full of ecards. Everyone, quite rightly, cites the environmental wastefulness of sending cards through the post and says that they are donating to charity. And quite right too. Can't be good for the Christmas card market, though. 

I wonder if the same thing will happen to books?

Because I live surrounded by fields, the gas that runs my central heating comes, not from miles of pipes connecting to the North Sea, but from a tank in the garden. What's quite clever is that a telemetry device measures the levels of gas in the tank, then it looks for a mobile phone network and logs on to whichever one has the strongest signal. From there it makes a connection to the computers of its masters and updates them on whether I need a tanker to visit and top me up or not. I was told, when the telemetry unit was installed, that all I had to do was pay the occasional bill - everything else was automatic. But apparently there's a flaw in this system. Yesterday my hot water went cold.","And when I checked, the boiler had shut down. Literally* five minutes later the phone rang to say that it looked like I was ""low"" on gas and would I like some. I asked if maybe in future that shouldn't happen <em>before</em> I ran out - that's how the previous owner said things worked. I was told that that's the norm, but I had opted instead to call them when I wanted gas. News to me. But why did an engineer visit recently to fit the clever telemetry unit then? So they can monitor levels - and call me just after I run out, apparently. I'm sitting here in a coat (in my kitchen) typing this and wondering whether to drive over to Em's and have a nice hot bath in a little while. I hope the truck comes and there's heat and hot water soon. My nose is cold.

As a very special seasonal treat I am going to make fifty copies of Mothernight available to five lucky groups. That's right - the first five groups - that's book groups, libraries, schools, organisations, Guides, the staffroom, the smoking room, whatever - to email me will get ten copies of Mothernight to read, review and enjoy. And hopefully discuss with their friends who can buy it when it comes out in March! 

I will post them out for free, but to one address only. If your group happens to have a few more than ten members, then still email in and I'll accommodate you if I can.

So, first a fun (or possibly boring) story. And then a prize! (oooh!). Remember I was saying how much I enjoyed the strangely compelling TV series Industrial Revelations? Well, I ordered it and waited and waited and couldn't get updates on when it was coming so after two months I e-mailed to cancel my order. I then ordered it elsewhere, got it a week later, and began recommending it to people. Then I got an e-mail from the first company telling me they'd shipped my order. So I wrote to them to remind them about the cancelling and to ask them not to bill me. I haven't heard back and the order arrived yesterday. Now I've thought about sending it back and trying to get a refund out of DVDi, but if they don't respond to e-mails and they won't let you cancel an order, I reckon that isn't going to be much fun. So this is my solution: firstly, to let my little corner of the world know that they are useless and everyone should stay away from them. And secondly to offer my spare DVD as a prize in the following quiz.","Q1) Behind which impressive (British) structure from the industrial revolution might Jesus Christ be buried?
Q2) There is no 's' in team, but which gaseous form of a popular solvent is crucial to much of the technology of the Nineteenth Century?
Q3) How many fingers am I holding up?
Q4) Is Mark Williams excellent as an enthusiastic and funny presenter?

e-mail your answers to me here:

Well then. I tried to do a bit of digging on the answer to Q1 and could find very little to support the notion behind the question. The answer I was looking for was St Pancras Old Church behind St Pancras Station, but I can't find any evidence that the 'myth' of Jesus being bured there predates the Internet, so I might have to cross that off the list of questions. Which makes John the winner, by dint both of his answers* and the lack of any other entries. Hooray!


*I was actually holding up four fingers, but rather than wade into a semantic quagmire over the classification of the thumb, I will accept John's answer.","","","","2007-12-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Well, Heather, from the distant land of Minnesota, just tagged me for a book review meme. To anyone not 'hip' to the 'lingo' I'm talking about 'tagging' as in ""you're it!"" and meme as in ""dude, read some Dawkins, why don't you!'.

<p><strong>Book I'm reading</strong>: Virtual Light by William Gibson</p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong>: Every now and again, I re-read William Gibson's middle trilogy (Virtual Light, Idoru and All Tomorrow's Parties). I know I should find new things to read instead of going back over old favourites, but there's something very comforting about a book you already know won't let you down and whose language you get excited about re-experiencing.</p>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>:  [Chevette is remembering being sad and then getting ill, and how she came to live high up on the ruined Golden Gate bridge with lots of other dispossessed people:] </p>
<blockquote><p>Chevette stood up and shivered, this tremor running down through her like a live thing, the way those red bracelets had moved.</p><p>How she felt, now, was just the way she'd felt that day she'd come back to the trailer and found her mother all packed up and gone. No message there but a can of ravioli in a pot on the stove, with the can-opener propped up beside it.</p><p>She hadn't eaten that ravioli and she hadn't eaten any since and she knew she never would.</p><p>But this feeling had come, that day, and swallowed everything up inside it, so big you couldn't really prove it was there except by an arithmetic of absence and the memory of better days. And she'd moved around in it, whatever it was, from one point to another, 'til she'd wound up behind that wire in Beaverton, in a place so bad it was like a piece of broken glass to rub against that big empty. And thereby growing aware of the thing that had swallowed the world, though it was only just visible, and then in sidelong glances. Not a feeling so much as a form of gas, something she could almost smell in the back of her throat, lying chill and inert in the rooms of her subsequent passage.</p><p>'You okay?' Nigel's greasy hair in his eyes, the red ball in his hand, a cocktail toothpick with a spray of amber cellophane stuck in the corner of his mouth.</p><p>For a long time she'd wondered if maybe the fever hadn't burned it out, hadn't accidentally fried whatever circuit in her it fed back on. But as she'd gotten used to the bridge, to Skinner, to [couriering] at Allied, it had just come to seem like the emptiness was filled with ordinary things, a whole new world grown up in the socket of the old, one day rolling into the next - whether she danced in Dissidents, or sat up all night talking with her friends, or slept curled in her bag up in Skinner's room, where wind scoured the plywood walls and the cables thrummed down into rock that drifted (Skinner said) like the slowest sea of all.</p></blockquote>","","","","2007-12-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

And so this is Christmas, and what have we done? I am too enthusiastic about the future to do a retrospective on 2007, to be honest, so if you want to remember what we've done then browse the archives on the sidebar!  

2008 is full of promise: some outstanding books that have already had some excellent feedback, a fantastically exciting Cycling range in development, our new alliance with Susie and team, the launch of SnowAngels, a gorgeous new website in the new year that I've been working on for the last few days and the chance of making our star shine even brighter. So much opportunity! 

So have a very lovely festive break, and see you in the New Year where Rob, Anna and I will look forward to bringing you the finest in independent publishing for another year. Thanks for your support in 2007 and here's to the new one!","","","","","2007-12-24","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","5"

I've touched on this before, but in my mind* there's a definite link between <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour"">Le Parkour</a>, modern crafts and the impulse that makes someone take the back off their Xbox and fiddle with it until they can use it to check their e-mail as well as play video games. Parkour, by the way, is that thing you've seen on TV, but may or may not know the name of, where scruffy athletic types bounce like ninja rabbits 'cross-country' through a city. Have a look <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEbYtOEftc0"">here</a> if you want your mind well and truly boggled. 

The common element I see in all those things is a refusal to behave like a good consumer. With Parkour, you're given a city with paths and pavements and 'Keep Off The Grass' signs all laid out for you, and you decide instead you'll zip across rooftops, bop over walls and traverse urban precipices in much the same manner as flying squirrels.","With crafts, you're less likely to break your spine in fourteen places, but it still seems to me to be an act of assertion. It's ordering something that's not on the menu. It's seeing a million advertisements a year for factory-made goods and saying, ""You know what? I think I'll make my own."" And because so much effort and money goes into cramming every shop on the high street with finished goods, there's something almost seditious about wilfully rolling your own. 

My take on crafting is that it satisfies a number of desires: the desire to learn skills and to practice craftsmanship; the need to be an individual; the desire to have something tangible and practical to show for one's labours  (as opposed to being a small cog in a boring machine - which most of are (or have been) in our day jobs). And the need for a community based on something other than geography or career choice.

Parkour partakes of the punk ethic, but stylishly so. And it achieves something rather beautiful: all the rigour  of a full-contact martial art, but with no fighting. There's a chapter in Naomi Klein's No Logo about how we don't even have the right any more to choose what we look at. We're not allowed to get rid of billboards or take down advertisements - regardless of whether we can afford any of the products we're being wooed and hounded to buy. We apparently have no right to be left alone by advertisers unless we want to lock ourselves in our homes. We have no right not to be sold to. Those 'rights' are available only to the rich. And if you take an Orwellian view of Le Corbusier's maxim that a house is a machine for living in, then a city becomes something rather inhospitable and confining. It's no wonder that sometimes the dwellers inside the urban machine want to rebel and assert themselves. <a href=""http://www.adbusters.org/home/"">Ad-busters</a> and culture-jammers rewrite corporate billboards (among other things); Banksy (et seq.) generate their own 'folk' friezes and assert their 'right' to decorate the city they live in. Urban explorers and infiltrators regard 'Keep Out' signs as an invitation to enter and a promise of good things. It's much more about defying rules and conventions than breaking laws.

And my personal favourite, and perhaps the least consciously political of these things is hardware hacking: the aforementioned tinkering with consumer technology. Microsoft might regard the Xbox 360 as a finished and inviolable design, but a cadre of stubborn and inquisitive hackers see it as an excellent <a href=""http://www.hackaday.com/category/xbox-hacks/"">starting point</a> for building some cool gadgets. I tried my hand at some of these things last year. I turned a little wireless router that lets my laptop connect to the internet into a wireless music player. I set up my Sky+ box so that I could copy shows (the unencrypted ones) straight off its hard drive and onto my computer, where they could then be put on DVDs. My phone, my MP3 player and my wifi router are all running software written by geeks instead of the code they came with. I love the fact that somebody somewhere handed over a couple of hundred pounds for a mobile phone, and when it didn't do quite what they wanted and the software was buggy, they didn't hand over more money for another model, they fixed it. 

My favourite magazine at the moment is a cleaned-up and law-abiding outlet for this instinct for tinkering, customising and adapting. It's called <a href=""http://www.makezine.com/"">Make</a>, and if you ever wanted to take control of the inanimate objects around you, you'll love it. They do their best to sound like well-adjusted home-grown engineers rather than disenfranchised hackers but I can't help thinking that the impulse behind both is similar: the wish to be allowed to use one's ingenuity and free-will to fashion - and re-fashion - the various gadgets, appliances and accessories of the modern world. Just as urban infiltrators take 'Keep Out' signs as a challenge, hardware hackers see those little 'Warranty Void If Opened' stickers and dive in.

To make a larger point, I think the better big businesses get at having their own way, the more these mild forms of consumer disobedience will spread - but I like to think even if the power of big business diminishes people will still want to cultivate craftsmanship and apply it ingeniously and  individualistically.

I love new year resolutions. I know it's an artificial point in time, no different from any other time of the year, but like most people I like the idea of seasons, cycles, renewal and whatnot. I usually have at least ten, but I'm happy if I achieve just one of them. So here is my list, so far: no doubt it will grow over the next few days as I think about it more. 

- Lose ten pounds (of course. No NYR list is complete without this old chestnut)
- Only use keyboard shortcuts, not the mouse, in InDesign, Photoshop and Word. And Excel. And everything. 
- Become ambidextrous
- Sell more books
- Drink more water
- Never drink instant coffee
- Get better at saying 'no thanks' to things I don't want to do 
- Don't work on Sundays (not for religious reasons, just to have a day off)
- Keep inbox at zero (easy, actually, now I use <a href=""http://www.rememberthemilk.com/"">RememberTheMilk</a>. Everything goes on a list. Those lists are quite long, of course.)
- Make the company more profitable. (Good one, that)
- Do more housework
- Go for a walk every day

Actually, in writing that list, I'm pretty happy with how everything is at the moment. There are no huge 'must do this because am bad person' ones. Yey.

So what do they do with the potential explosives they confiscate? Dump 'em in a big old bin right next to the queue of people because we all know there are no explosives in there.","Personally, I don't understand why it's worth spending billions to stop me dying on a plane, but safety upgrades on trains are allowed to wait for decades because they cost money. Is it really worse to die because of terrorism than because of a preventable accident? Aren't ya just as dead? But then these things never seem to be about actually saving lives.

I was once told I couldn't get on a flight from Edinburgh to London because my passport was out-of-date. I'm talking about an internal flight here. I could have travelled the same route on a train and no one would have cared whether I could prove who I was, but planes are different.

Em and I should have more going on in our lives, but the Christmas Doctor Who seems to be a big deal.  We swapped notes after watching it and were just about able to award it an 'OK'. There were lots of reasons to like it and probably slightly more reasons to feel disappointed. Unlike last year, we weren't asked to root for someone whose every utterance and gesture grated. But rather like other years, almost all the elements of the story seem to be... well, like other years. [contains spoilers]","The idea of a luxury cruise orbiting Earth where the systems have been sabotaged we've seen before in <em>The End of the World</em>. The idea that a legion of identical menial helpers turn murderous because they've been taken over reminded me of the Ood in <em>The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit</em> - maybe crossed with the masked automatons from the <em>Girl in the Fireplace</em>. The idea that to dispose of a character dramatically you show them drifting away from the camera in slow-motion free-fall, while heavenly voices sing, comes from... well, it seems like at least half a dozen episodes from the last three years. And painful farewells are more poignant when one of the participants is see-through, &agrave; la Rose's exit in <em>Doomsday</em>.

There's also the matter of killing most of the people the Doctor hoped to save. Russell T Davies admits he sometimes gets confused between 'drama' and just torturing characters, but tragic accidents leading to love-lorn suicides, followed by murders and the disintegration of a very likable new companion after only a few minutes in the job didn't fill me with the spirit of Christmas. (Clearly Kylie hasn't got time to join the show, but they didn't need to make her innocent, kind and hopeful - and then bump her off. I'm not sure the Xmas Special is the right venue to work on creating a sense of sadness and loss.)

I liked the acting, though. David Tennant was excellent as usual, Kylie did a fine job, as did everyone else. And it was lovely to see Bernard Cribbins - with the suggestion from the trailers that he will return. But for some reason, the lighting on this episode was very poor. If you happen to watch it again, check out the ballroom scenes at the beginning while the party is still going on - glaring hard light and murky shadows, when what was needed was some warmth, richness and twinkle. Britain has some fantastic DPs and lighting cameramen - seems strange not to use one.

So, all in all, time for some fresh ideas among the writing staff I think. A new showrunner with more of a flair for coherent and imaginative storytelling would be good. After all, Doctor Who can go anywhere and do anything; the show should never need to recycle themes and plots. 

One final thought from the opening seconds: why would a spaceship be sounding a foghorn? Fog in space? Horns in space? Is it possible they filmed the collision with the Titanic long before they came up with a plot?","","","","2007-12-30","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

Phew, and phew again. This Christmas I have mainly been up to my elbows in code, sprucing up the website all ready for 2008.  And here it is! Press f5 if you can't see any difference.","As is the natural way of things, Rob has written some of the most elegant XSL you can imagine which I've used to automatically create some of the new pages that you'll see if you take a look around. Everything's changed, from the CSS to the structure. There's a new section on <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/snowauthors.html"">our authors</a>, which will be added to over the coming months. (Snowbooks authors: take a look around, and if you have any extra content that you'd like to share with visitors to Snowbooks.com, email it to me and I'll put it up.) For instance, if you visit <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Bower.html "">Sarah Bower's page</a> you can read two chapters that were edited out of Needle in the Blood. Bonus content! W00t!

It's now (hopefully) much easier to buy our books from snowbooks.com, since I've got PayPal buttons for each book. There's an <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/snowshop.html"">Offers</a> page too, which I'll keep updated with some super deals on our books. Oh, and it's pretty much entirely XHTML and CSS compliant (there's the occasional glitch from third party forms and such like, but hey, 95% ain't bad). 

There's a whole new section launching SnowAngels, too - a bunch of services that we've been providing other publishers for a while but which I wanted to bring together more coherently. See <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/angels_design.html"">some of the covers </a>we've designed for other publishers, and <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/angels_IT.html"">watch how easily </a>I create 50 html files using XSL. The most important thing about this new-look website is that all the data comes straight from our APM bibliographic database which spits out an ONIX (XML) file at the click of a button. There's no re-keying, no duplications, no out of date information (unless it's out of date in the database! Point is, we have to update just one source of data, then everything else is current.) It's the future, kids - and now that SnowAngels is up and running, you can get us to help you make the most of your ONIX data just like this. <a href=""mailto:mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"">Drop me a line</a> if you're interested. 

What else, what else. A splash of new CSS and images for the blog, as you can see. I did, actually, completely upgrade from Movable Type to Wordpress - but this morning I realised that all the permalinks where people have linked to us from would be broken. I thought there'd be a plug-in or something to fix it, but I couldn't find anything. And Wordpress runs on PHP which is just plain weird. So I flipped back. The lesson there is to plan ahead properly - another one for my New Year Resolutions list. 

There are bound to be a few errors, so please do <a href=""mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"">let me know </a>if you find anything broken, or wrong, or weird. Prizes to people who find really awesome mistakes! Would love to hear what you think of it - but only if you like it. (I'm only half-joking. No, really, ideas for improvements always welcome, as we'll be tinkering with it for a few more months.)

It's weird, coming back to interacting after being immersed in a big project for a week or so, especially when the email's slowed down to a trickle over the holidays. It's been really enjoyable to focus on just one thing, and do it properly. I suppose that everyone goes back to work on Wednesday, so the email and phone calls will start up again, but I'm glad I've done this huge project now because I probably wouldn't have had the time to do it any other time of the year. That feeling that you get when you've walked a long way, and you look back over the hills and dales and feel quite chuffed that you can't even see your starting point on the horizon, you've come so far? That's how I feel about this website upgrade. 

Blimey, I hope you like it. And I hope it sells some more books...","","","","2007-12-31","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","6"

If it does, I think a full-blown U.S. depression will happen. Wow, let's hope all the flaws in my analysis show themselves soon, right? (Although, on the other hand, it would force America to stop spending 50% of its GDP on weapons.)","","","","","2008-01-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

As far as I'm concerned, several times a week Amazon do something foolish or disappointing. For instance when I'm browsing for DVDs they helpfully classify them into categories like Action & Adventure / Sci Fi / TV and so on - and then they put pretty much every DVD in every category making the classifications annoyingly useless. <em>Life on Mars</em>, the time-travel detective show appears in Documentaries. <em>The World at War</em> (WWII history series) is in Action & Adventure. And everything in Sci Fi is automatically considered Action & Adventure too - so why have two categories? (And heaven forbid any of it should ever have been shown on TV as well.) They're also great at recommending things I'll love - like football autobiographies (yuck) - or really need, like parenting manuals.

Here's today's recommendation (see pic). OK, I'm not entirely averse to the idea of a textbook on protein structure. But it's in German. And probably not the easy kind. Which I don't speak either.","","","","","2008-01-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

<p>How's this for a cunning idea? I quote a chunk of something Bruce Sterling said, and do so without permission, and when he gets in touch to yell at me, I can say 'hi' and see if he wants to hang out. Unless it's just his lawyers who call. Or he's really cross. Which I don't suppose he would be. Anyway, the following is excerpted from <a href=""http://www.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/317/Bruce-Sterling-State-of-the-Worl-page01.html"">some remarks</a> he was making about the shape of 2008, from his perspective:</p>","<blockquote><p>Serious-minded people everywhere do know they have to deal with the
resource crisis and the climate crisis.  Because the world-machine's
backfiring and puffing smoke.  Joe and Jane Sixpack are looking at
four-dollar milk and five-dollar gas.  It's hurting and it's scary and
there's no way out of it but through it.</p><p>

Everybody's reluctant to budge because they sense, probably correctly,
that they have to wade through a torrent of mud, blood sweat and
tears.  Maybe, then, they emerge into the relatively sunlit uplands of
something closer to sustainability. </p><p> 

So: I don't expect too much to happen in 2008: except for that
intensified smell of burning as people's feet are held to the fire.  
""Nothing changes if nothing changes."" But if nothing changes, then more
and more china is going to flat-out shatter and break.</p><p>

THEN they'll move.  If they see somebody making money at it, they
might move pretty fast.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that sums up a lot of what I think - only more eloquently. Except that I hope a bit of action will take place in 2008.</p>","","","","2008-01-04","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

So, Piers Wenger <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/dec/11/bbc.television?gusrc=rss&feed=media"">will be in charge</a> of Doctor Who for season 5. I can't say I'm reassured. I haven't seen <em>Housewife, 49</em> but I did see <em>Ballet Shoes</em>, his other recent project and I think it was flawed in exactly those areas where Doctor Who is currently having problems. If someone wanted to repeat the mistakes of recent episodes, it seems to me that Piers Wenger might be the man to do it.","I don't know if anyone saw <em>Ballet Shoes</em>. It looked lovely, it was acted delightfully and it was only at the end that I realised they'd forgotten to set up and pay off any sort of story. It had very much the look of a book adaptation where all the important scenes from the novel are represented - but without any appreciation of the emotional function they're supposed to serve. In <em>Ballet Shoes</em>, the two spoiled brats appeared to get exactly what they wanted, mainly by dint of behaving like brats. I'm fairly sure the source material had them learning a valuable lesson, but it was missing from the TV adaptation. And Sylvia got the man she was hoping for, but his declaration was made to look so much like a parting thought, it removed most of the romance from it (to my way of thinking). Similarly, Theo's last-minute rebound romance is shoehorned in so briskly that it was only on later reflection that I realised she would be the solution to the question of  who would chaperone Pauline in Hollywood. The last ten minutes of Ballet Shoes was a dog's breakfast of editing just when real skill was required. I get a bad feeling when I see so many signs that someone high up doesn't know how to pay off storylines.  So much professional excellence seemed to me to be allowed to drift off the road and into the weeds. The director must take most of the blame, I suppose, but Mr. Wenger presumably had the option of correcting matters - and either chose not to, or didn't realise there was a problem.

Only the other day I was hoping for someone to take over Doctor Who who really understands the structure of storytelling (as opposed to simply the staging of drama). On first glance, it doesn't look good. Personally, I think the BBC should have swallowed their pride and recruited a first-rate showrunner from America with the intention of transplanting some of that expertise permanently to the U.K. Britain has writers and crews and all manner of expertise, but it doesn't seem to have the showrunner role quite sorted yet. There shouldn't be any shame in learning from others. I bet Jane Espenson or Tim Minear would have been interested (and I daren't even breathe the name Joss Whedon - plus I don't want anyone distracting him <a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ifabb1526bf648422a2d53ac7422bd528"">right now</a>).","","","","2008-01-04","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

I really hate BIC codes. They could be so helpful. They are not helpful. 

Don't read on if you're not a publisher - it's too boring for words.","So I'm trying to find a BIC code for a piece of fiction, written last year, which a retailer would class as women's fiction. Best practice is to have a level three code, which means it's classified in the most detailed way possible. My choices, though, are: 

F - Fiction, level 1. Doesn't give enough detail, so I can't have this. 
FA - modern and contemporary fiction post c 1945, level 2. I could have this, but it's a bit vague, and there isn't a level 3 option. 
FR - romance. Er, not really...
FRD - adult and contemporary romance, the level three option. Even less accurate...

And that's it. The rest are all Historical, or Saga, Adventure and so on. And the same restrictions apply when I try to classify Adept - it's supernatural fiction, or thriller, but there's no option for supernatural thriller, and in thrillers the level 3 options are espionage and political/legal. 

Is anyone else as frustrated as I am about this? Annoys the hell out of me.","","","","2008-01-04","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

I threatened to enthuse about the book I'm reading, and given the surprising number of thank you notes in response to my last post I'm afraid I'm going to go ahead and wallow in my geekness for a while longer. Below the cut is a book review of sorts - but don't expect it to be the sort of book you'll want to rush out and buy. At least, you won't unless your day job includes running a publishing company.","My new book is called <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Designers-Guide-Adobe-InDesign-XML/dp/0321503554"">A Designer's Guide to Adobe InDesign and XML</a>. That might sound a bit dull to you, but those words pretty much cover off my life goals at the moment. As you might know we use ONIX data, which is a form of XML, to manage and use our bibliographic data. I'm always very keen, therefore, on finding new ways and best practice to make the most of this data - to use it to create our web pages, catalogues, to fill in forms and to generally avoid having to type out data manually. Who wants to be typing out data when you could be reading the next potential bestseller, or talking about our books? Getting computers to do the dull stuff means we can spend our time having fun. 

To date, I've found a couple of white papers from Adobe and a couple of cut-down chapters in the (generally excellent) RealWorld InDesign book from Peachpit Press. Apart from those tantalising snippets of info, though, Rob and I are pretty much on our own, feeling our way. There just isn't anything out there, aside from expensive expert consultants, that really gets to the core of using XML in InDesign. We've even looked at ditching InDesign and upgrading to FrameMaker which, it is rumoured, supports XML in a much more structured way. Rob spent a few months writing some scripts to create a directory we did, but we shouldn't have to resort to programming, surely. In fact, if you google 'ONIX Publishing', in the first five results is a link to <a href=""http://absurditypublishing.wordpress.com/2007/05/11/anko-onixindesign-tutorial-part-two/"">my own tutorial </a>on ONIX and Indesign, closely followed by a link to our <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/A%20simple%20guide%20to%20XML%20for%20publishers.pdf"">own white paper</a> on XML for publishers (the majority of the other results, naturally, are from <a href=""http://absurditypublishing.wordpress.com/"">Robin at Anko</a>, tireless enthusiast for spreading the ONIX message that he is). I was resigned to a couple of years of trial and error to get up to expert level at this stuff. 

So I can't tell you how exciting it is to find a whole, beautifully laid out, 324 page bonanza of a book dedicated to teaching me, in gorgeous, intricate, wonderful detail just how super InDesign can be at handling XML. When I say 'super', it's still ultra-picky - make one, tiny, wrong move and it just won't work - but who cares, now I have a finely-crafted user manual to guide me through it. 

And so, finally, I get to the point of this post. This book - this heroic, perfect, targetted, WONDERFUL book that is going to add two years to my life and save me hundreds, maybe thousands of pounds - cost 27.19. What an absolute bargain. The value I'm going to get from it far, far outweighs the cost - and I'm going to learn a hundred times as many things from it than if I spent ten times the cost on a training course. My point? Books are absolute bargains. Same goes for fiction. A good novel can change your life, or, at least, provide you with a fortnight's entertainment. Quite a bargain for 7.99. 

I'm not sure what my point is after this, though. Would we want novels to cost 30, or 40, or 50, or non fiction to cost 100, or 200 - a cost more on a par with the value they can provide? I know that <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Creating-Trading-Floor-Managers-Construction/dp/0749448385/ref=sr_1_19?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199569071&sr=1-19"">some Kogan Page books</a> cost about 300 - and I suppose, if you're setting up a trading floor, 300 is a drop in the ocean. Libraries would probably enjoy a resurgence if that was the case. Interesting to think about, isn't it? 

<hr/>

<em>Rob's update</em>: As all you budding classical economists out there will know, what Em is talking about is 'utility', the benefit you get from something expressed in monetary terms. Ideally, you'd charge each person a whisker less than the utility they get from buying it. I've given this a lot of thought over the years, and I think the way forward with flexible, personalised book pricing is to insist that customers read each book with their head in an MRI machine (or similar). You then charge them based on how positively they reacted to the material. Interestingly, this would make many worthy-but-hard-work prize-winning titles free, but guilty-pleasure Jilly Cooper's could end up costing a fortune. Weird I know, but It's the only way.","","","","2008-01-05","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Wow, sci fi get's a bad press. As I think I've observed before, it's <em>so</em> unpopular that good sci fi ceases to even be sci fi. It gets honorarily promoted out of the category. It gets rescued by mainstream literature. It gets discovered, like a diner waitress being selected for a Vogue cover. Worse still, to paraphrase and sort of read between the lines, luminaries like William Gibson seem to think that sci fi is dead. Well, not dead exactly, but quite possibly no longer practical.","Bill (as I might call him if we were buds) Gibson tells a story from 1994 of receiving a fax from a fellow sci fi writer. The fax contained a press cutting about how Elvis Presley's daughter was marrying Michael Jackson. Next to the story were handwritten the words: ""This makes our job more difficult"". By which his friend meant that we were entering the era where fact was routinely stranger than fiction. You could try to outpace reality, but you'd probably just sound giddy and manic, or you could soberly project forwards the interesting trends of today and risk writing sci fi that's less futuristic or outlandish than the morning newspaper. 

Imagine it's 1990 and you read this blurb:
""It's 2008 and something is wrong with Earth's climate. It turns out that since the industrial revolution humans have been inadvertently altering the weather and now our species is under threat. But a crazed evangelical sits in the White House, obsessed with bombs and war, hateful of science, who believes that we live in the End Times and that Islam and Socialism, not CO2, are the real threats. Corporate behemoths control Congress while an oblivious populace sits glued to their 'reality TV' shows - a form of Twenty-First Century video entertainment in which everyone watches everyone else compete for pointless celebrity. A deadly sexually-transmitted disease rampages unchecked across the Third World while the U.S. Army is encamped in the Middle East, making sure that the dwindling supplies of oil go to fuel the Fifties-style gas-guzzlers that America is still in love with. The space program is forgotten, 'survivalists' are no longer cranks, they're 'security consultants' earning millions and obesity is becoming a new plague in the West while among the have-nots starvation is as common as ever."" I mean, come <em>on</em>! It's not remotely believable. It's like something written by a depressed sixth-former.

An <a href=""http://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/news/2007/04/scifighetto_0412"">article at Wired</a> echoes the theme. If it's good, then it can't be sci fi.

In the world of books, sci fi has been spinning down since the Sixties. <em>Clockwork Orange</em>, <em>1984</em>, <em>Brave New World</em> and (for some reason) <em>Childhood's End</em> were all books I was required to read for school in the Seventies. And after school I used to trawl the sci fi shelves in whatever my local Waterstone's was called in those days looking for cool new adventures to immerse myself in. Then, sometime around the early Eighties, the flow of sci fi began to dry up. The two bays of sci fi books I knew so well became 'Sci Fi and Fantasy' - and new fantasy titles gradually edged out the stagnating, dwindling sci fi offering. Every few years I try to find a sci fi author I like, but they're few and far between. The two notable exceptions, Neal Stephenson and William Gibson, have both moved away from sci fi in such an orderly fashion, book by book, that if you graphed it, you'd get a straight line. William Gibson has retracted his stories into the present; Neal Stephenson has receded into the past. And I think I detect a hint of irony, because William Gibson got into sci fi in the first place partly because he saw its fallow acreage in the Eighties and realised he could move in unopposed and start raising crops. But now reality is squeezing him out.

And yet...

On the one hand, how else are we going to work out what we think about things unless we do it through sci fi? It's not like we're going to have a national debate about cloning, say. As my failed attempts to interest anyone in reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shock-Doctrine-Rise-Disaster-Capitalism/dp/0713998997/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199612520&sr=8-1"">The Shock Doctrine</a> have brought home to me, the only way to get people to think about the future is to make it fun, a game, entertainment.

And on the other hand, CGI is like a monster that's got loose and now it's feeding, growing strong, and is all set to rampage across the visual landscape of our culture chomping on everything in its path and refusing to be stopped. All the unmakeable movie pitchs of the past are about to become makeable. You just know that in creative meetings somewhere in the Los Angeles Basin, Hollywood execs are challenging each other to think of 'impossible' movies - the more impractical the better - because what better way to showcase the new VFX technology and blow people's minds than by filming the unfilmable? Mark my words, some time in the next decade, someone will decide to make a movie from the Book of Revelations.

But I would still maintain that written sci fi is possible. I just read Cory Doctorow's <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Down-Magic-Kingdom-Cory-Doctorow/dp/076530953X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199612695&sr=1-2"">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a>. I have quibbles with the story - or at least I have differences of taste - but it managed to weave an interesting yarn while tricking you into thinking about what the world would be like if status could be automatically calculated as easily as counting hits on a web site. And what if switching to a new body was routine? And what if that aforementioned status replaced money because mechanisation had removed the scarcity of inanimate objects? And what if, within all that futuristic weirdness, the story revolved around friendship, romance, ambition and the search for a bit of job satisfaction?

I think sci fi is still 'doable', but I think it's getting tougher and tougher to make it genuinely thought-provoking <em>and</em> genuinely accessible at the same time. I don't think you can just transplant a Western or a war story onto a space craft any more. For a reminder of how not to do it, the ultimate in bad sci fi is still that slice of frozen time: Lost in Space - the Sixties TV show where in the future, everything will be exactly like 1960, but sprayed silver. You can't just tinker with the technology and call it The Future. You have to figure out what will become of our friendships and fears and jobs and health concerns and prejudices and aspirations.

Or, on the other hand, you can forget about sci fi in book form and simply write a sci fi movie script that has shapeshifting magical telekinetic giant alien monster robot mutant exploding... <em>everythings</em>. And then let <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000881/"">Michael Bay</a> take a whack at it.","","","","2008-01-06","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","10"

This post won't mean anything unless you're a fan of Serenity and Firefly, and you know the behind-the-scenes story.

After the second commerical break they'll screen a re-run of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320000/"">Fastlane</a> instead. Over a million outraged Whedon fans will march on Hollywood and Fox TV's headquarters will be torn down, much like the scene with the ents marching on Orthanc in Lord of the Rings.

But then Fox TV will rise from the ashes, when its DVD of Dollhouse stays at No. 1 in the DVD charts for 194 weeks. To celebrate they will offer Joss Whedon a chance to preside over a series they plan to resurrect especially for him. And that series will be called Fastlane 2010.

Because I get my news in strange ways, I never know if a story has been covered or not. I'm always surprised to find that no one has heard about something that seems big to me, whereas I suspect I know much less about the McCanns than most Brits.

So has there been a segment on t'telly about the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative, with its Give One, Get One sales approach for getting special 'XO' laptops into the hands of both Western and Third World kids? It's pretty interesting stuff. And it has a slightly Victorian social reform feel to it, in that lots of engineers have got together to Improve The World.","<a href=""http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XO:_The_Children%27s_Machine"">Here's</a> a link to the whole site about the project and the laptop. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/technology/circuits/04pogue.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&ref=business&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin"">Here's</a> the New York Times covering the story. And if you like hissing at people, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/technology/05laptop.html?em&ex=1199854800&en=a7aaaf2c3e2c9dbb&ei=5087%0A"">here</a>'s a story about how Intel seems to have seen the idea of helping poor kids as a way of grabbing some more money. They clearly tried not to be evil - or at least they decided to associate their name with a good cause - but when it came to the crunch they weren't able to restrain their urge to profit. In fact, the very nature of a corporation means they're <em>not allowed</em> to restrain their urge to profit. Registered officers of a company have a legal obligation not to pass up profit opportunities - and no obligation at all (unless you count the moral kind) to give free things to kids in dusty countries.

If you read the technical specs (and I'm not for a moment suggesting that you <em>do</em> actually read the technical specs (but I like that stuff)) you can see it's quite an innovative little laptop. The display works in sunlight as well as indoors. It takes very little power, but you can charge it by pulling on a string or hooking up a solar panel. It's packed with specially written, kid-and-teacher-friendly software. And the way each laptop's wireless connection lets it connect with everyone else's to share files and Internet connections is very interesting. These types of 'mesh' networks are actually pretty subversive. If there are enough mesh-enabled computers in the world, then they become their own infrastructure. Instead of using paid-for connections, all the data hops from laptop to laptop for free. It's just like the problem Intel had in the story above: there are ways to engineer things which look good on paper, but they have one terrible flaw: no one gets stinking rich. If little Third-World kids get laptops for free and don't need to pay for Internet connections then those little monsters are effectively taking food out of the mouths of shareholders. It's like the situation over in the music industry. It might suit bands and music lovers if it's easy to download and share music, but what about the big record companies and those artists who feel the need for multiple Bentleys? After all, don't  big businesses have a god-given right to take control of things and make money from them? Who wins, when cooperation and collaboration carry the day? Nobody, that's who. With the exception of the little people, and big business is certainly not about giving them a say. 

But the OLPC initiative appears to be one project where real, commercial-grade design, planning and innovation has gone into something decent and unselfish. The Internet is already a democratising force; how much more democratic will it all be when the unrepresented masses can see, hear and contribute to what the rest of us are talking about? Giving Third-World kids laptops is like giving poor people the vote. Who knows what crazy things they'll do with it?

If you read the first NYTimes article then you've seen how the head of the project, Nicholas Negroponte, responded to a question suggesting that poor countries need food, malaria protection and clean water more than they need computers. He said, ""Nobody I know would say, By the way, lets hold off on education. Education happens to be a solution to all of those same problems.","","","","2008-01-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Otherwise it's just getting too damn difficult to control the spread of music in a world filled with interconnected computers. Patrolling the internet, locking down people's PCs, copy-protecting their MP3 libraries: it's difficult, annoying and doesn't work very well. So many smart people think it would be better to give up. Let musicians and music lovers be happy together. Accept that in the future there are no giant, money-making middle-man corporations pulling the strings and deciding who becomes a star. Let people listen to whatever they want. As Seth says, record companies had a great run of it, but now they're screwed. And they're not going to win anything by spending all their time threatening, suing and locking up their customers. 

But what happens if you apply that succession model to books? What is the book equivalent of merchandise and concert tickets? I really can't believe author readings are going to be something we all attend regularly. So what else is there? If you don't try to police the spread of ebooks (which, if you think about it, would be rather a noble idea) then how does anyone make money from writing books? Even if we accept that publishers can't cash in; how do authors afford their bread and jam? Rich sponsors? Writing to order/by commission? By having a day job (shudder)?

Small Publisher to Sue The Arts Council For Not Following Its Own Disinvestment Guidelines

Dedalus Publishers in Cambridgeshire, which is one of The Arts Councils smallest clients receiving a grant of just 24,958 in 2007/8, is to challenge The Arts Councils decision to stop its funding from January 2008, on the grounds that The Arts Council has not followed its own Disinvestment Guidelines.
 
The Disinvestment Guidelines, which can be accessed on The Arts Council web site outline a seven stage procedure for disinvestment which usually lasts from 6 to 18 months for regularly funded organisations.  
 
The Guidelines exist for a purpose as stated by The Arts Council on Page 1, These stages provide a clear process to ensure that the decision to disinvest is correct and that we can defend such a decision against any challenge.
 
The seven stages of the Disinvestment Guidelines have clearly not been followed for most, if not all of the 194 organisations who received a letter from The Arts Council dated 12th December 2007 withdrawing their funding with no prior notice.
 
The decision to disinvest from these 194 organisations in the manner cho sen by The Arts Council is therefore open to legal challenge.  Dedalus invites all affected organisations to join in its legal challenge. 
 
An organisation which cannot follow its own rules is not fit for purpose. The Arts Council has lost its way. It is not there to destroy 194 arts organisations overnight but to foster the arts. Eric Lane, M.D. Dedalus Publishers

I should probably put my usual political-rant caveat on this post. If you're not a left-wing leftie lefterson, parts of this might rub you up the wrong way. 

So anyway, I was <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/01/the_death_of_sci_fi_sort_of.html"">recently</a> kicking around the notion that sci-fi is getting more difficult to write because fact is stranger than fiction a lot of the time. Annalee at the newly-launched <a href=""http://io9.com/"">io9</a> has a different perspective and has said that sci-fi is so pervasive that it is <em>de facto</em> a mainstream genre. I suppose so many traditional sci-fi staples are now a reality (gadgets galore and a looming dystopian future) that not being interested in sci-fi is like not being interested in life. I was going to say 'like not being interested in current affairs', but that's actually pretty common - and sort of what I wanted to talk about. I think sci-fi has got more difficult because everyday reality has actually become less believable.","To refresh your memories, I'm referring back to the narrowing credibility gap that's squeezing sci-fi. Reality is now strange to the point of corniness. If you try to outdo it, you sound preposterous; if you don't, you sound quaint and dull. I cited William Gibson's example from the Nineties of Michael Jackson marrying Elvis Presley's daughter, but there are heaps of other examples. You could talk about movie stars becoming president, for instance. Probably too silly and over the top for a book written in the Seventies, but not too silly and over the top for reality. I'm sure you could come up with our own examples too. In fact here's a little mental exercise for you: try to think of a concept for a reality TV show that's too outlandish to ever get made. You can't. You might come up with one that is illegal or too offensive to be broadcast - but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be successful. Find spouses, swap spouses, tempt couples into infidelity, have ugly people compete to win cosmetic surgery, revive your flagging celebrity status by demeaning yourself, punish fat people, binge drink to shame your kids - no matter what you come up with, you can't convince yourself it's 'going too far'. You can't be sure some production company isn't already discussing it.

So that's part of the problem: when the non-sci-fi parts of the media are allowed to apply their unfettered and so-immoral-it's-amoral imaginations to devising entertainment it puts the squeeze on sci-fi futurists. But it has occurred to me that there's something else going on too. I think our sense of <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/verisimilitude"">verisimilitude</a> is also being undermined. (Do excuse me for putting a link on that word, but outside of the Lemony Snicket movie, a person could go years without hearing the term and thus being prompted to look it up.) 

And if I'm right, the culprit is the combination of politics and PR which every year controls more of what we see and hear. Propaganda wasn't invented in the Twentieth Century, but that's when the science of it began. Official statements, branding, PR campaigns, professional spokesmen and the idea of 'image' all become more universal over the course of the last century. Polling for movies, product launches and political campaigns has become vital - and it's not because it's 'nice to know' how you're doing; it's so that you can change what you're doing. Messages are crafted and tested - and re-crafted. ""What do I stand for? What do you <em>want</em> me to stand for?""  We now consider the idea of unscripted remarks from someone in power rather shocking and unprofessional. We might expect politicians to lie, but we also punish them if they give us the unvarnished truth. We expect not just the content but the delivery of everything we hear to be expertly timed, phrased and choreographed. And it has spread to business and celebrity. We expect all figures of prominence to be 'mediated', their public perception monitored, analysed and refined. In consequence of which, we know most of what we see and hear from anyone famous is scripted and on some level fake.

For me, and I suspect many others, the proof that this scripting and crafting had spread to the news media was brought home during the lead-up to the Iraq invasion. Most of us weren't happy about what was about to happen but we didn't see our views represented on the evening news (especially in the U.S.). It was as though we looked in the mirror of mainstream journalism and couldn't see our own reflection. The 'popular opinion' we saw on TV didn't include us or the people we knew.

And even though everyone, even the sceptics among us, now know the whole thing was a sham and a disaster, the fiction continues. In reality, the war is illegal and we were lied to about the reasons for it. But on TV, it was 'controversial' and politicians were 'forced to make some very hard decisions which at the time they believed were right'. The fictional element to the reality we see on TV is now so strong that it continues almost untouched by the calamitous events taking place in the actual real world. On TV, global climate change is still up for debate, American foreign policy is about spreading democracy in a troubled world, corporate hyper-profits are good 'for the economy' and the news brings its audience the truth (rather than belatedly admitting it to them).

How can sci-fi writers craft a near-future world that seems believable when our own present isn't remotely credible? It can't. It can only do satire - and even then it has to pick its targets. Not only is reality TV unspoofable, but so is American politics (if you can imagine it and it's logistically possible, it has happened). Supporters of a draft-dodging president can paint a decorated war hero as a coward by buying ad time on TV to lie about him. It can happen in the glare of prime-time and it can work. I've lost track of the number of times I've seen Cheney or Bush lie - and all that would be required to expose them in their lies would be to pull the relevant tape of their earlier remarks from the tape library and play it: something that every news network in the U.S. is capable of, but none ever does (except Comedy Central - which isn't a news organisation). The fiction shouldn't hold up - but it does. 

When the flimsiest of fake realities can withstand a storm-force pounding from reality and not even bend in the wind, what store can we set by our sense of verisimilitude? For sci-fi I think pickings are slim, unless you choose as your backdrop the far future, the altered past or galaxies far, far away. And there's no sense in having sci-fi help us make sense of the future when we haven't made sense of the present yet. Orwell wouldn't be able to satirise current presidential spin and Kafka couldn't outdo Guantanamo. If near-future sci-fi is struggling I think it's probably reality that's to blame.","","","","2008-01-09","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I have just had an insight into publisher brands, and it wasn't pretty.","So it's a dark and stormy night, and I'm half-heartedly pursuing my hobby of trying to find Robert Smith's contact details on the net (so I can do the book I so badly want to do: a slim poetry-like volume of all the Cure's lyrics, presented as poetry. For that's what they are - life-changing, life-shaping, life-enhancing poetry. Sigh.) whilst doing some admin. So I go to <a href=""http://www.geffen.com/"">his label's site</a> - been there before, no luck, but you know what internet searches are like - you end up visiting the same places. And it strikes home when I see a form box inviting me to sign up to Geffen's email newsletter. Why on earth would I want to do that?  To get updates on Mary J Blige, Snoop Dogg, Keyshia Cole  and Lifehouse, and maybe twice a year on the Cure when they announce a concert? Er, hardly. But, on the other hand, I'm a signed-up devotee of thecure.com. 

It's just the same with publishers. Unless you're my mum (hello, mum!) you probably don't like Needle in the Blood *and* Monster Island *and* Lint *and* Adept *and* City Cycling. But I bet if you liked Needle in the Blood, you can't wait for Book of Love. 

Authors are the things that people are interested in, just like I'm interested (heh) in Robert Smith. I couldn't give a wet slap about Geffen. And sure - their site is pretty, and loaded with info, and shiny bits and tunes and whatnot. But it's too fractured, too diluted. And not at all human. 

Maybe because Snowbooks is obviously run by people, not robots, we'll be ok. Maybe there's enough human interest to keep you guys interested. It's funny - I do feel sorry for big companies. Everything's changing, and they're too slow to react. The future's about meaningful interactions with real people, not call centres and corporate-speak. Thank god Rob and I escaped the rats in time. 

What do you think? Are publishers - music or book - redundant? Can trade publishers have a brand? Are we doomed?  Or are friendly little boutique companies going to be increasingly what people want?","","","","2008-01-09","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

For reasons I can't precisely recall, on Tuesday I decided to drop my phone into a river. It lay at the bottom for about a minute, its screen blazing white as all its little pixels lit up. Then, for various other reasons having to do with balance and slipperiness, I lay on the bottom of the river for rather less than a minute. But what's more than a little surprising to me is that two days later I'm using the phone without any problems. Yes, there's still some water under the touch-sensitive screen. And immersing it caused it to forget the date and time - but apart from that it's just the same as before (only slightly cleaner). If you don't believe me, try it for yourself.*

You probably learned in school that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. Or given that many of you are probably Eng. Lit. fans who snoozed through science maybe you learned no such thing. In fact, being arts graduates you probably heard it stated as a law but assumed you could get out of it if you had a good excuse. Well, it turns out you were right - and what better excuse than aesthetics? That picture is the pretty glow you get when you force charged particles to travel faster than the speed of light. Isn't that great? Science being contravened in the name of art. Except of course science is still in effect. The trick is that the speed of light is lower inside things - like water - and the rule about how fast you can go only applies to the speed that light reaches in empty space (where it's travelling flat out).

How will authors make a living in the future? Will they have to go door to door offering to tell people stories? As you all know, I often think about the battle between copyright holders and pirates - and as time goes on, I side less and less with the former and more with the latter. In fact (just to go off on a tangent for a minute) Em and I have a new thing where she comes over to visit me mid-week and we go for a walk, then watch a film and gorge ourselves. I rent movies from Amazon, which is a great idea except for one problem: they all turn up scratched. Maybe 50% of them don't play properly. One solution (take note here) is to wash them and then apply a coat of car wax (something which I should occasionally do to my car too). Another, for the techier contingent, is to make a copy of the disc. It will still be missing data where the scratches were, but on the copy they'll be simple gaps and not tantalising blurs which the player tries over and over and over again to read, thus halting the movie. On the copy they'll be glitches that pass and are instantly forgotten. But copying the disc makes me a pirate. The irony? The disc I've had to copy this week is Pirates of the Caribbean III. In it the pirates are the good guys, but that's not quite how Disney see things in real life.","On the one hand Naomi Klein has been warning us about this stuff for a decade - Disney being a prime example. They want you to watch their movies and then buy your kids lunch boxes and hats and stickers and toys and happy meals and bedding with Disney characters on. They'll sell you a Disney pen and a Disney notepad covered in Disney characters. But if your wicked child should use that pen to draw in her pad a picture of the Disney characters she is surrounded by and then put that picture on the wall where people can see it, she's infringing copyright. And BoingBoing were carrying the <a href=""http://www.boingboing.net/2008/01/13/ford-car-owners-are.html"">story</a> of how a Ford Owners Club couldn't produce a calendar of pictures of their pride-and-joys because images of those cars were automatically property of Ford, not the owners of the cars.

But on the other hand, you can download any album or DVD in the world given an Internet connection. Pretty much.

So is piracy out of control or have copyright holders just turned into Fascists? Or both.

An interesting documentary that you can download for free, called <a href=""http://stealthisfilm.com/Part2/"">Steal This Movie II</a> (just don't ask about Steal This Movie I) talks about how the Internet can't work except by making copies. As a file steps its way from your computer to its destination, at each point along the way a copy is made, then the previous copy is deleted, and that's how data moves. Given that, how can you stop people copying anything that exists on the Internet? And given that words, music and pictures are all digital these days (even paperback books get written and typeset digitally) that means the question of piracy is settled: the pirates will win. There's no way to stop them except to ban computers.

Given all that, I keep wondering what will happen when electronic books are common and therefore easy to pirate. Publishers will struggle - just the way music companies are really starting to feel the pinch now - but what about authors? I've discussed several ideas in <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/01/the_paperless_everything.html#more"">the past</a>, like sponsorship from rich patrons (like the days of the Medicis). And lately I've wondered if micro-payments are the answer. If it was really, really easy to pay 30p for a book - you just had to tick a box next to the thing you were downloading - would most of us happily pay for books even if it was optional? Or might we want to decide on payment afterwards, giving a tenner* to authors we love and ignoring the rest? With that model it's better to be the favourite author of a thousand people than to bore a million. Or maybe some authors will go the whole way and swap stories for cat food and socks, like my pal <a href=""http://www.jennashworth.blogspot.com/"">Jenn</a> (page down a little if you want to see what I mean).

And the initial indications are promising. America has done everything it possibly could to bankrupt itself and it's finally working. The Bush administration worked hard to reduce tax revenue while massively increasing spending. They put as much of that money as possible into attacking other nations and scaring their own. They undermined their own manufacturing base with trade agreements designed to send jobs abroad where they'd be performed at slave wages. Like governments before them, they noticed their nation's dependence on oil and worried about it. Then they did their best to gut any attempts at energy self-sufficiency while simultaneously starting a war in the heart of the biggest oil producing region on Earth. If overspending and undertaxing wasn't enough to bankrupt America, then maybe pushing up the price of the fuel it runs on would do the trick. The whole enterprise has been funded by borrowing ludicrous sums at unsustainably low interest rates - and just to guarantee disaster, all of that money has come from overseas rather than from its own people - who have likewise been encouraged to spend every cent they can get their hands on and to borrow, borrow, borrow more. America taught Bin Laden's people how to fight a guerilla war against a superpower just in time to become his next target . They encouraged Saddam Hussein to attack his neighbours and supplied him with arms to do so, until he picked one they didn't approve of.  They overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran so that fifty years later they could threaten to attack the region in the name of peace. They've rigged elections, propped up dictators, invaded sovereign countries, bombed civilians, armed terrorists, angered the world and spent all of their money. In my view, the best thing that America could do is to stop frantically poking hornet's nests all over the world. And just like every other country with power (or in the UK's case, close to friend's with power) that decision is never taken voluntarily. The only way for America and the UK to give up their bullying is to become incapable of it. That will be President Bush's legacy: the humbling of America. When the U.S. is no longer a threat, it will no longer be a target either. The War on Terror will have been won - and all it took was the looting of a nation and the ruining of its good name.","","","","2008-01-17","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

<del>Old</del> Well-established friend John A-W notified me yesterday that Apple had released a sliver of a laptop calculated to make people like me say 'I want one' just before enquiring 'what is it exactly?'. But the 'what' is easy enough. It's a laptop where everything but the keyboard and screen have been made invisibly small and the whole thing has been worked over with Apple's Magic Aesthetifying Snake Oil until it gleams with techno-desirability. I remember a few year's back, friends of friends who were usually too cool to speak to me coming up asking, '<em>You</em> know about this stuff; do I need an iPod?'. The fun for me was realising that they didn't know the function of the device in question, only how powerfully needful it was. So, aware that I don't have any spare money or need any more computers, I nipped over to Apple to see how much this new marvel (called the <a href=""http://www.apple.com/uk/macbookair/"">MacBook Air</a>) costs.","It appears that $1800 (the US price) has somehow become 1200 (the UK price). Strange that PayPal gave me $1.90 to the pound on something I bought this morning. Let the dollar fluctuate for a few weeks more and you could save 300 pounds buying a MacBook Air in the States. And the 300 would pay your airfare. Not that I'd advocate filling the upper atmosphere with more junk just so you can acquire more junk down here on Earth. But as long as it's cheaper to shop six thousand miles away than to buy it locally, it'll be a shiny, shiny temptation.","","","","2008-01-17","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I've been getting on very well with working from home because I am both a morning and night person, and less of an early afternoon person. It means I can get up early(ish) and get straight to work, without wasting my productive hours on a commute (although I do think an early morning cycle is a great way to wake up). Then I can get a bit lazy around lunchtime, make some food, perhaps, as has happened a few times since Andy gave me the complete Buffy DVD set (all 7 series. Yes, I am married to the perfect man) even watch an episode of Buffy whilst having my soup, or go for a walk or meet Rob for lunch in Chipping Norton. Then I can do easy tasks until I take advantage of the fact that my brain kicks back into gear around seven in the evening, and have another blast at the important stuff until bedtime.

Do I dare trust myself to write a post about BBC flagship-show Torchwood? Probably not. Let's hide it behind the cut just in case mention of its name discombobulates my brain and crazy talk ensues.","First off, well done James Marsters. In the first episode of season two he was turning sows' ears into satin-finish rayon purses at a rate of knots. But the introduction of an actor with real range, presence and mature confidence just made it look as though most of the rest of the cast were standing around watching him, waiting for an opportunity to ask him how he does it.

Here's the premise of Torchwood: <em>tell</em> the viewer that they are watching an elite team tackle alien incursions, but never show them doing any such thing or even acting as a team - and if they do take action to sort out an alien menace, make sure it was entirely their fault in the first place so that it's clear that disbanding the team is the only solution that makes sense. In fact ideally have every episode centre around the bickering and mutual loathing of the team members until it starts to seem quite logical that they would endanger the Earth and shoot each other more or less on a weekly basis. This innovative concept has all the appeal of the X-Files if Scully and Mulder did nothing but bicker viciously while in the background monsters romped. Or original Star Trek, if  Kirk, Spock and McCoy argued, got drunk and then had a fight every week. And make sure the whole thing is done with dialogue that swerves between ludicrously bombastic, childishly clich&eacute;d and things nicked from American TV that sound silly when transplanted to Cardiff.

Torchwood isn't bad. It's a disgrace. It suggests cluelessness of staggering levels. It looks as though a group of people with no writing experience put it together. My favourite example of what's wrong with it comes from the worst piece of television I have ever seen: season one episode six, Countrycide. After five weeks of bumbling and bickering, causing problems instead of solving them, hating themselves and each other, the team is disarmed and captured by cannibals. Even though the team have guns, they are outclassed. Their enemy is able to sneak up behind them, even when they are alert and it's broad daylight, and knock them unconscious. Who are these unbeatable fiends? Well, someone thought it would be a cool sixth-form sort of twist to attribute their evil not to alien possession, but simply human depravity. Which means that Torchwood were defeated by middle-aged Welsh farmers with no special training. There is literally no one on Earth who couldn't outsmart or outfight Torchwood. And the team don't even <em>want</em> to be doing what they're doing so badly. In fact they never waste an opportunity to bemoan their lot.

My suggestion? A new Torchwood team and a new writing staff. And just to smooth the handover process I have worked out what could happen to the existing characters. They're called in for perfomance appraisals and informed that they're a massive and embarrassing liability to the planet. Then Tosh can move to being IT manager for a local call centre. Gwen can go back to being a police officer, a job she will also struggle with, though not as badly. Owen can drive a mini-cab for a while before his tendency to get into fights leads him into trouble with the police. Ianto can finish university and go backpacking until he figures out what he wants to do next. And Cap'n Jack (a name that always seemed to me lifted straight from Pirates of the Caribbean) can go back to Doctor Who, where he's fun, rather than spending time in Cardiff which clearly depresses the hell out of him, just as it does me (at least when it's in the company of Torchwood).

While the U.S. Writers' Strike continues, the BBC have an opportunity to borrow all the best names in American screenwriting, hire them for a month at a time and get them to teach their British counterparts how it's done. And if they don't think it's necessary, I suggest they watch Torchwood: Season One again and make notes. This is a golden opportunity - and would provide a bit of income to excellent American writers who are living on their savings at the moment. In the new spirit of BBC Glasnost, the corporation should admit when it's in over its head and hire in some talent. That way James Marsters won't be left trying to salvage an entire TV series all by himself. Though it's fun watching him try.

(And if anyone wonders why I don't, as they say in the youthful vernacular, 'get a life', it's because in a couple more years I'd like to write for TV, and a healthy sci-fi franchise or two would be a perfect venue to aspire to. But it's all a bit pointless if the end-product is wasted cash and red faces all round. The UK should make one fifth as many good, action shows as the US - based on our population. I don't think it's anywhere near that number at the moment.)","","","","2008-01-21","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

One or two thoughts about animals, now that I live among them in The Sticks.","<em>Mice</em>: I quite like mice. But I am going off them for two reasons. Firstly, one runs around in the ceiling at night, scuffling and jumping up and down and twanging wires and things. It is badly behaved. And secondly I took a bite out of a kit-kat the other day before realising that about 40% of it was missing and the remainder had thousands of tiny bites out of it. That too is bad.

<em>Spiders</em>: No. Yuck. I've tried not to be afraid of them, but it doesn't work. It just makes me annoyed with myself as soon as I stop panicking. Sadly they like my barn. They should return to the fields. If they do not, I will be forced to Take Steps against them. Hopefully I will win. In the meantime they are always ruining things for me.

<em>Buzzards</em>: Excellent. Enormous buzzards circle here most days. They are too cool to flap their wings and they regularly get attacked by much smaller birds. They circle away flinching when this happens. I suspect they are very lazy creatures.

<em>Kestrels/Angels</em>: A while back I walked up the hill towards the local church, the sun was just passing behind the steeple, and shafts of afternoon sun were poking down into the field where I was standing. In the middle of the shafts of light was a hovering angel. Then it swooped down on the field - whereupon I could see it was only about a foot long. So it seems that hovering kestrels when dazzlingly backlit  and seen from the right angle look just like angels. However it is my understanding that angels prefer to attack cities rather than field mice and generally come up at least as far as a person's knee.
<em>
Muntjac deer</em>: Not quite as majestic as the other brands of deer. The one I saw today was about two foot high and was standing on a roadside verge with its head in a hedge, presumably snacking on something, while its butt end poked out towards the cars. This is not especially dignified or impressive.","","","","2008-01-25","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Here's a little U.S. politics/economics. Look away if you don't like that stuff. A tax refund is being planned to stimulate the listing American economy. To help, it needs to be spent by the recipients, not saved. One can make sure it's spent by giving it to people who can't afford to save - the ones who are really struggling at the moment. The chart to the left shows what percentage of the rebate will go to each of the five U.S. income bands (click to make the picture bigger). Giving an <i>equal</i> rebate to each band would be bad enough, because America's wealthiest aren't going to spend that money, but giving the richest fifth four times what the poorest fifth get is ridiculous. Yet more free handouts for the rich will do nothing to stave off a U.S. depression.

Em and I are currently poring over the Snowbooks accounts, looking for clues, tips and dire warnings about what's worked for us in the past, with a view to deciding what might work in the future. One thing that stands out is the untold story of a certain Christmas from years gone by. That story can now be partially told - partially, because we don't want to alienate further the retailer who nearly bankrupted us. Those not of faint heart, read on...","Hollywood frequently concerns itself with the true meaning of Christmas, but it's also something that most manufacturers and retailers have to grapple with. Christmas is a big expensive gamble. A lot of stock gets sold, but then a lot doesn't - and even getting a seat at the table costs serious money. It doesn't suit everyone. But one Christmas Snowbooks decided to go for it. Several of our titles had been accepted for nationwide promotions in a certain large retailer of books. As you will know, publishers are expected to pay a 'promotional support fee' in order to get onto a promotion - in addition to bearing the cost of discounting their books. We reckoned we could afford the up-front payment and signed ourselves up. 

The first snag was that the retailer wrote to us nearer the time and said that the price had gone up. In the case of several of our titles, it had almost doubled. We'd already printed the extra books by then and we reckoned we could still make money on the deal, so we agreed. 

Now in some industries, that up-front payment is netted off against sales. That's to say, if you agreed to pay five thousand pounds to get your book on a promotion, the retailer deducts that five thousand pounds from your 'winnings'. But in our case we were expected to pay up in cash, rather than have the amount withheld from sales. Raising the price meant we were stretched very thin for cash, but we thought we had a strong line-up of titles. And of course paying in cash meant parting with the money many weeks before any sales would come in to cover that cost. Cashflow is always tricky when you're little, but we found a way to make it work.

The promotion began and we rushed out to stores to see how our books looked... and for the most part couldn't even find them. A couple of our promotions were fine; the rest were a shambles. So began several weeks of to-ing and fro-ing where we would visit a store and find no evidence of most of the promotions we were paying for. We would query it and be told that all was well in the stores we hadn't visited. So we'd visit more stores and see the same thing (or lack of it). Books that should have been on promotional space weren't. Books that were supposed to be stickered weren't. Books that were supposed to be face-out weren't. Stock was low when it ought to be high. We started to panic as Christmas got closer. And the messages we got back from the retailer insisted that 'compliance' was fine. In desperation we hired a third-party firm to document 'compliance' and they found some very troubling things. They visited thirty-seven stores around the country and in no case were all our promotions being run as agreed. Some titles were only where they were supposed to be in 20% of locations. One wasn't being promoted in any of the thirty-seven stores visited.

We made as much fuss as we could, but to no avail. Then the bill for running those promotions came due. We showed our evidence: that the overall compliance rate was 19%  - and asked to be let off some or all of the 'promotional support' payment. No deal.

Our next step was tricky. We could take legal action and almost certainly win our case, but would we ever do business with that retailer again? That wasn't a risk we wanted to take. The retailer's representative was friendly enough and had some ideas about how to make the following year more mutually satisfactory, but was insistent that we should pay the full amount. We swallowed hard and handed over the cash. 

So, to summarise: we printed extra books, paid what for us was a very large sum to have them on prime Christmas space, in most cases those books never got near that space, then they were shipped back to us and pulped (it being too costly to have our distributor sift through returned books looking for pristine copies).

The final irony was that the retailer concerned then went from listing pretty much every book we published to listing pretty much none of them. So there was probably no reason to put up with their Christmas extortion and no way to benefit from their plans for the future. That particular Christmas wiped out all of our profit for the year and a bit more besides. And the annoying thing is that I'm still not sure what we should have done differently, except psychically know in advance that we were going to get screwed. The only lesson we've managed to extract from the sorry tale is to take Christmas gingerly, at least until we've built up enough funds again so that being taken for a ride won't bankrupt us. 

Just think of how poetic it would have been for Snowbooks, the frequently winter-themed publisher, to be destroyed by Christmas. But then if our survival had been seriously threatened, we would probably have got the lawyers involved and done our best to drag the matter into the press, which might have actually done the rest of the industry a favour. Apologies all round that it didn't come to that.","","","","2008-01-29","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","8"

Rob's explained below about the ghost of Christmas past: here's one from the present day.","I've just received word from Nielsen, defender of bibliographic truth and knight of ONIX data, that the reason some of our book records are not getting through to retailers (which I only discovered because Susie bothered to check for me - naively, I would have assumed that if I sent an ONIX compliant record to Nielsen, to whom I pay 400 a year, they would process it in a timely fashion and pass it on) is because Nielsen have not yet migrated to BIC 2.0. 

I know - another boring post from Emma about dry old data. Let me explain, though. BIC, the people who are responsible for providing classification codes for books, issued an updated classification system in April 2006. *2006*, note. This new system, 2.0, replaced the former one, 1.1.    

It has been 22 months since the old system was declared obsolete. 

I understand that many organisations will not have upgraded to 2.0, for all manner of reasons. However, as guardians of data and leaders in the field, Nielsen should be setting an example to everyone and encouraging them - through ceasing provision of 1.1 data after a suitable cross-over period of, say, 12 months - to migrate. Nielsen are able to insist on a whole bunch of strict requirements to process ONIX data, and they managed the ISBN13 migration, so they should be able to insist on BIC 2.0. 

To get round their tardiness they employ people to take my pristine ONIX data (the data I thoroughly validate to make sure there are no errors), to look at the BIC 2.0 code and to take a stab at deciding which BIC 1.1 code should be used instead. Human intervention, in my experience, always leads to error. That's why we've gone to the bother of implementing ONIX - so that there are no rekeying errors. Moreover, there's no straightforward correlation between the two classification systems so there is a real degree of subjectivity involved. There are precedents for their lack of accuracy: for instance, when I registered A A Milne's The Sunny Side with them, via ONIX data, they rekeyed it to be a children's book, thinking they knew better, causing untold lost sales as the witty, adult articles from Punch Magazine sat next to Disney editions of Winnie the Pooh stories. 

It matters which subject area a book is classified under - if it's a thriller but is classified as crime that's a completely different buyer, a completely different part of the shop, a completely different search on Amazon etc. And it matters that data management is as efficient as possible. So, I go to great lengths to make sure that our data is accurate and timely and machine readable. I am thus very disappointed that despite my best efforts, a team of people get a chance to fiddle around with it, delay its dissemination and, if they hit the jackpot, render it incorrect.","","","","2008-01-29","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","5"

I'm just having one of those moments, sort of like the opposite of <em>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</em> (which I suppose may or may not be called <em>jamais vu</em>) when I look at the technology of 2008. Every now and again it dawns on me all over again how incredible it all is. I am remembering back to when I was sixteen and I wanted a computer. If some previously unknown but kindly aunt had decided to indulge me, and had bought me a top-of-the-line Cray 1-A supercomputer, I would have had the fastest production computer on the planet. This is a description of that machine: ""The supercomputer weighed 5-1/2 tons, arrived in two refrigerated electronic vans, and needed more than 30 construction workers, engineers, and helpers to move it into the computer room. The CRAY-1A had a 12.5-nanosecond clock, 64 vector registers, and 1 million 64-bit words of high-speed memory."" All very impressive I'm sure, but my current mobile phone could give it a very serious run for its money - and probably beat it for many types of calculation.","Now I'll grant you that my phone doesn't have a groovy Seventies earth-tones colour scheme. And it doesn't have its power-supplies covered with leatherette cushions to make it into a piece of furniture - not to mention a conversation piece - but on the other hand you <em>can</em> just slip it into your pocket and carry it around with you all day. Back then, no amount of money would have allowed you to create a machine of that power which would sit in the palm of your hand. It's sort of weird to realise that half the gadgets in my house would have been worth billions in 1980. Building them was more difficult than putting a man on the moon, because while a lunar visit was within the reach of Seventies technology, a portable MP3 player wasn't. They would have loved to be able to create tiny, high-speed CPUs and memory chips of the required power, but in 1980, it couldn't be done.

Just in case I stumble across a spacetime vortex that will take me back to 1980, I think I might make extra sure that I could swap my phone for, say, Manhattan Island by storing a zipped up copy of the human genome on its flash card.

I am in a perceptive mood today, and have some answers to some burning questions - and a couple of suggestions.","<strong>First question: why do imprints exist?</strong>
Possible Answer: so that companies can sell them off when times get tough. If your business is divided into imprints, you can flog 'em as a discrete entity. If all the titles were lumped in together, it's harder to siphon them off. Am I right? 

<strong>Second question: why do publishers have to employ so many people, and how does Snowbooks get away with employing so few? </strong>
Answer: because many publishing employees are undertrained. 

Explanation: I generate a fair percentage of Snowbooks' current revenue from publishing services - doing cover design, typesetting and so forth for other publishers - so I get to see how these other companies operate. Now, dear clients, don't take this the wrong way but you could easily dispense with the great expense that is me by just buying a couple of thick books for 30, or even paying to go on a 300 course, and then practising a bit, to learn how to use InDesign and Photoshop. 

Example: Today I've been finishing off some typesetting for a client. It's the sixth iteration that we've been through:
1) was the initial design - a sample chapter or two for them to review and sign off the font, layout etc
2) was the editor's remarks
3) was the author amendments
4) was a further set of editor remarks (possibly after an internal meeting)
5) was the first set of proofreader's remarks
6) was a further set of proofreader's remarks

Now, there are a couple of dispensable people and processes here. Me, for one - I've been receiving hard copy marked up proofs through the post (it's a few hundred pages long book) and just implementing the markup in InDesign. The editor or proofreader could easily have made those changes as they identified them. In the last iteration, the editor marked up a hard copy *and* sent the proofreader's marked up PDF via email - the marked up PDF would have been fine. Even better, the proofreader could have made the changes direct to InDesign - cutting out the editor, the postman and me. 

My cover design clients also rely on me for things that take me about 30 seconds, but if I'm out of the office when they need it, they have to wait half a day - things like turning a photoshop document into a jpeg and resizing it. I know I would find that very frustrating, and would want to learn how to do it myself to wrestle back some control. Because as we all know, if you're in control of something it's a lot less stressful than relying on someone else. Or is it just ol' control-freak me who thinks that? 

So, because I'm weird, I'm going to really try hard in 2008 to make myself for the most part redundant, by sending through detailed instructions to my clients of how to do the easy bits each time they ask. In fact, I've done this often in the past, but I can't have explained it very well because I still get the questions, and then feel rotten if they're waiting for me to get it done, and for charging money for something that is so simple.  

Here are some notes I've made in the past:

What's slightly less cool is that this article says the plane <em>could</em> be ready to fly in as little as twenty-five years. What's even less cool about it is that I read an almost identical article in 1980 about a plane that had a lot more backing than this current proposal. No, if you ask me, designing supersonic passenger planes is a lost skill of the Seventies. My parents were lucky enough to fly on Concorde once (and survive!). For the rest of us, we've basically been flying in 747s (or variations on the theme) for forty years now and it's not likely to change any time soon.

Also, Em and I were chatting the other day about how in 1980 we were twenty years away from being able to generate unlimited, pollution-free electricity from Hydrogen Fusion. And we were also twenty years away from being able to distribute that electricity using commercial room-temperature Superconductors. Sadly, in 2008, we're <em>still</em> twenty years away from both of those things. Which is a shame, because if the plans from 1980 had panned out, we wouldn't have to worry about catastrophic climate change.","","","","2008-02-06","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

For all my talk of pre-plotting, I tried doing some screenwriting the other day. I just sat down and wrote the bits that had popped into my head without worrying too much about where I'm going with it. It was some of the most fun I've ever had with a word-processor. Exhilarating! It's like a drug. No more pre-built plot for me. The story will just have to take care of itself. Stand aside!

Not about how much fun it's been, but about abandoning planning permanently. It's been great, but of course now I'm stuck. And as I should have made even more clear, I almost always write (hopefully) pacey thrillers or mysteries. Surely it would be irresponsible to write a whodunnit, without knowing whodunnit. Or to work your way towards an action-packed climax (we're still talking writing, here, by the way) without first deciding what the climax is.

This time last year, my favourite new U.S. TV show was Standoff - which was cancelled mid-season. This year it's Journeyman - which was cancelled mid-season. It puts me in mind of a comment I once read about how The West Wing wasn't especially popular or successful - except among a vocal and influential minority. Since all sorts of people watch TV I suppose it stands to reason that pitching a show at the more demanding viewer risks alienating those who don't want their drama complicated or confusingly non-formulaic. But surely the trick, as in all business, is to cut your cloth accordingly. If, by making a relatively sophisticated show, you're going to alienate four-fifths of your potential audience then you have to create a business model that works for a smaller audience. You have to spend a smaller amount of money and aim for a much smaller success.","Journeyman was a very intelligent take on the potentially silly idea of time travel - but it must have been relatively expensive to continually set scenes in different decades (thought I suspect they restricted themselves to the previous four decades or so, to limit the costs). Standoff was forever storming buildings and blocking off streets - also expensive. But Britain is full of excellent actors who work cheaply. And scripts are cheap too. And it has excellent crews, with tons of experience. I'd really like to see those three things pushed at the expense of everything else: great scripts, great casts, great crews. In exchange I'd reluctantly have to accept: no visual effects, limited locations,  no big set pieces. It must be possible to shoot something really gripping on HD video on a couple of simple sets, and a couple of carefully chosen exteriors, for pennies. Then it could afford to be as alienatingly sophisticated, with frustratingly intelligent dialogue and maddeningly inventive plots, as it wanted to be. Cheap, in television,  doesn't necessarily mean low quality. Just as expensive doesn't necessarily mean good. 

And this is brought home even more to me as I play around with the latest generation of video software. There's almost nothing you can't do on a high-end Mac or PC these days. You can capture, edit and colour time. You can score and mix. You can animate and composite. You can model, ray-trace and render. You can master and author and burn to DVD if you want. And frequently the program I'm using on my PC is the same one as being used on $150m Hollywood movies. It's not about money; it's about skill. And, at least in Britain, that's always been underpriced. Surely, if there's any sense to these things, we are about to enter the era of affordable niche programming. What else is going to fill all those hundreds of Sky channels? So let the sophisticated drama commence!

<strong>[Contains spoilers for Torchwood episode: Meat]</strong>

Having said all that, I can't resist a word about last night's Torchwood. It's definitely getting better. It's still bad: lazy, sub-standard, melodramatic writing and patchy acting, but it's getting better.

Last night the team attempted to disable five armed factory workers and save an injured alien. They had the element of surprise, alien weapons, superior numbers and the resources of the government if needs be - oh, and one of them is indestructible. In a conventional drama the heroes would have faced impossible odds and won. In Torchwood, the team face trifling odds and lose. But last night they managed what, for them, was a great success. Yes, they ended up killing - on purpose - the alien they wished to rescue. And yes, one of them got shot. But in Season One, Torchwood wouldn't have been able to get out of the van without getting into a fight with each other and being captured. In Season Two, sneaking up on some meat packers who they outnumber was <em>only just </em>beyond the limit of their abilities. By Season Three, I fully expect them to be able to hold their own, one on one, with untrained humans of middling intellect.","","","","2008-02-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

<em>I've budged this up the running a little because people are still busily commenting. Plus I'm adding bonus material(!).</em>
I feel quite anxious about this post. I've got some thoughts I want to share, but part of me thinks this is one of those things it's better to keep quiet about. But on the other hand, why should I be afraid to voice my views? What's the worst that can happen? So here are some potentially incendiary opinions about storytelling.","When I read Stephen King's book <em><del>On Drinking</del> On Writing</em> I was very disappointed to learn that he's one of many authors who will set out on a story not knowing where it will take them. When he talks about writing endings which disappointed fans, but which had become inevitable, I want to phone him and say ""but that's why you need to plan ahead"". I can picture the autobiography of a disastrous architect containing the same revelations: ""Sometimes we'd get towards the completion of a building and I'd realise there was nowhere to put the bathrooms. What the disappointed users of the building need to understand is that by that point there is an inevitability that takes over. As the finishing touches occur to you, there's a limit to what you can shoehorn in.""

When I hear such wing-it writers being interviewed, it always seems to me they've placed their own working preferences ahead of the readers' ultimate satisfaction. Sure the building fell down, but emotionally the architect had moved on by that stage and was ready for a new challenge. Sure he could have reviewed the plans early on and fixed the problem, but he didn't want to risk becoming 'stale' or 'predictable'.

Now, that's not to say I dislike all books that are plotted on-the-fly or that I don't appreciate the skill that goes into them. It's akin to someone who builds a comfy camp for the night with only the twigs and leaves they find on the ground. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't rather travel in the company of someone who plans ahead, prepares in advance, and has all the important necessities to hand at the right moment. 

To me, starting a story without having planned it first is like starting to tell a joke before you've thought of a punchline. Or setting off on a journey before selecting a route. Beautiful, happy accidents may result, but not as frequently as disasters will. Which would be fine, if the disasters were quietly disposed of, but I've lost count of the books I've read where I got the impression the author was flailing for an ending or had changed their mind halfway through about the kind of story they were telling. 

Writing is inherently spontaneous and creative. Ideas always occur along the way. Setbacks present themselves and need to be overcome. There is no way to keep the creativity and the imagination from happening. Thinking otherwise reminds me of those cultures who worry that if you don't teach children to walk, they'll never learn. Walking and creativity happen whether you assist them or ignore them. So I don't accept that the writing muse is totally feral and might be driven away by anything inimical to its wildness, such as a pre-determined plot. Plots are channels for creativity to flow down. They make sure all that creativity gets to where its needed. 

Of course, the danger is that when confronted with such a channel we decide to fill it with clich&eacute;. And there is no remedy for that except to be wary and inhospitable to clich&eacute; - as part of your structured approach. Force yourself to get from A to B using something original, or at least something fresh (because 'original' is too much of an undertaking in the age of television, where we've all seen ten thousand stories, and it will warp your plot if you allow it). Eliminating clich&eacute;s is hard work, but in my mind that's not an excuse to avoid pre-planning; if anything it's another reason for requiring it.

Naturally great plots can come together for authors who do wing it, but surely not with any dependability - and I really feel we shouldn't be expected to read (or watch) all of their experiments. 

Personally, I've found the literature of screenwriting fascinating and helpful when it comes to storytelling. It continually asks questions about the function of each event, each scene. It asks: why do we care? What's the point of this? Is this relevant? Does it move the story along? 

If you watch a scene written by a good screenwriter you will see double or even triple duty being performed. You will see characters being defined, at the same time as background exposition is being sneaked in, at the same time as the plot is being advanced. And it will be done in a way that uses humour or conflict or compassion or curiosity to make the scene work as a standalone piece of drama. 

Now, I readily accept that these rules can be over-applied. Or mis-applied. Or that better alternatives may present themselves which appear to break the rules. But in my mind there's no doubt: if you cultivate a way of thinking where you always know why you think your audience cares about your characters, and what you expect the audience to take away from each scene, and you think about what you're setting up and how you're going to pay it off, then your stories will be better for it.

Morals can be cheesy, lessons learned too overt, stories too neatly tied up with a ribbon - but being aware of the danger of over-applying a structured approach is just another part of the structured approach. I think of the screenwriting attitude to storytelling as a series of questions - and you'd better have good answers to those questions. If the 'function' of most of your scenes is just that you thought they were 'good writing'  (as opposed to good storytelling) they'd better really be amazingly good because most of us have 'internalised' the rules of storytelling, even if we can't explicitly state them. We tend not to like stories that wander or fizzle out - and by and large we don't want them to just finish; we want an ending. The more sophisticated among us can cope with very open, very ambiguous endings, but most of us are more likely to mutter: 'well what was that all about, then?'

Personally, what I would like to see is more great writers obsessing over plot. To relate it to composing music: I don't want more atonal symphonies, where the performing musician decides how to get from a start note to an end note over eight bars; I want more beautifully crafted pop songs which make me happy or make me want to dance or take me instantly back to a perfect moment, or even choke me up when I'm feeling emotional. Sonnets are a strict form, but that doesn't put off great poets. I'd like to see more really intelligent writing within classic, emotionally-satisfying plots. I want to read detective stories and romances and action thrillers and even sci-fi by the giants of contemporary literary fiction. I think then we'd really be able to judge their abilities. They'd take some stick from certain academics and certain critics, but they'd re-energise the book world, delight millions and win my respect into the bargain.

Now, form an orderly queue to tell me why I'm wrong about every single thing I've just said.

(Oh, and these are general points of course; I'm not picking on anyone in particular here. Except Stephen King.)

Particularly interested in Zos's view on the non-limitations of pre-planning. But I thought I'd share with you why planning looms large in my personal thinking: every now and then I like to write a particular type of story and although they're just one dot on the fiction spectrum, the thought of someone attempting one without a plan is almost inconceivable to me. You may not like this example, but I think you'd have to admit, not having a plan in place before you started writing would be pretty limiting and probably self-defeating. <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Mystery%20on%20the%20District%20Railway.pdf"">A short (2500 word) story what I wrote.</a>","","","","2008-02-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","31"

No, that's not Darth Vader, silly. It's Batman. Probably doing some brooding. It's part of a poster for this summer's <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/"">The Dark Knight</a>. I loved the last Chris Nolan Batman movie: <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450392/"">Batman Begins</a>. It's the only one of dozens of recent superhero big screen adaptations that I've really enjoyed. (I thought Spiderman III was the second worst big-budget movie I've ever seen; Bad Boys II being the absolute worst.) Batman Begins did such a great job of making silly aspects of the Batman story seem sensible. Like the name and the cape: Batman uses theatricality in an attempt to inspire superstitious fear, because otherwise one man doesn't stand a chance. And then coming up with a reason why it would work: a whole town having a bad acid trip. When I heard that Heath Ledger was going to play the Joker, and I saw a picture of him in his make-up, I couldn't wait to see it.","I had visions of something to match Cillian Murphy's sublimely good Scarecrow. Then when I heard Heath Ledger had died it seemed such a shame that he didn't get a chance to let rip in a part like that. But what I've only just discovered is that he'd completed filming for The Dark Knight, so this Summer I'll get a chance to see it after all. I hope it's a belter.

<p>For no particular reason, I've written the colonial pronoun <span style=""color: maroon;"">you'all</span> a couple of times lately. It's often written <span style=""color: maroon;"">y'all</span>, but all the Midwesterners I know who use it, say it <span style=""color: maroon;"">you'all</span>. Just in case you don't know about this, I thought I'd tell you why it's a handy pronoun and how it relates to non-standard English-speakers who say <span style=""color: maroon;"">you was</span> rather than <span style=""color: maroon;"">you were</span> (shortly before they get a clip round the ear for same, if they're young enough). You know, just in case you care about such things.</p>","<p>We used to use <span style=""color: maroon;"">you</span> the same way some 'merkans use <span style=""color: maroon;"">you'all</span>. It was a plural pronoun which took over from <span style=""color: maroon;"">thee</span>*. The singular was <span style=""color: maroon;"">thou</span>.
Look at how nice and neat that makes the use of auxiliaries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was</p>
<p>Thou was</p>
<p>He/She was</p>
<p>We were</p>
<p>You were</p>
<p>They were</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then posh folk stopped saying <span style=""color: maroon;"">thou</span> and made <span style=""color: maroon;"">you</span> do double duty. They still said <span style=""color: maroon;"">you were</span>, but they said it when they were talking about something singular. This seemed illogical to everyone who wasn't posh. But posh people get to say what's standard and what's not**. So these days we have what looks very much like the plural form of the auxiliary, <span style=""color: maroon;"">were</span>, used with the singular as well as the plural pronoun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was</p>
<p>You were</p>
<p>He/She was</p>
<p>We were</p>
<p>You were</p>
<p>They were</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure many of you know this stuff, but still, whenever I hear people being told off for not talking 'properly', when all they're doing is maintaining the logical and historically well-established forms of their dialect it does make me think there's a bit of elitism going on.</p>

I love Director's Commentaries on DVDs. And it's often very revealing to hear what they say, the sorts of things they care about. In the commentary for <em>Mercury Rising</em>, a dud of a Bruce Willis movie, the director spent most of the commentary talking about locations: scouting for them, negotiating over them, switching between them. Yawn. But listen to, say, George Clooney talk about <em>Good Night, and Good Luck </em>and you're struck by how insightful and how incredibly witty the man is. So I was pleased to see that <em>Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer</em> had two commentaries.","As a movie it's pretty idiotic and pretty dull, but still, it was a major Hollywood project so I thought I might learn something. But I turned off the Director's commentary after ten minutes of drivel when he honest-to-god and without irony said, ""I chose to surround him with computer screens because a) it's great for lighting and 2) that's what he's all about."" Yes, he said a) and 2). And that was his grasp of life as a scientist: being all about computer screens. Then I tried the Writer's commentary and turned it off after five minutes when he used the word ""phenomenons"". It's OK for an actor to say something like that, but a professional writer? Who gives people like these $130m?","","","","2008-02-11","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

That's a <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7239005.stm"">story</a> the BBC have picked up. Here are one or two rather vitriolic thoughts on the subject.","It's a strange thing, but Saudi Arabia is our friend - despite having some very brutal laws. Women have hardly any rights. And a man can get into trouble with the police for buying flowers in mid-Feb because he might have a girlfriend, which is illegal. If you want to hold hands with a girl, marry her first. And then you can hold hands behind closed doors. And for goodness sake keep her covered up. It seems like a horribly repressive country to live in, just the sort of place that foreign policy hawks love to talk of 'liberating' (whatever that means. 'Bombing' I think.). And the Bin Ladens are from Saudi. Osama's money came from Saudi. And nearly all of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudis. Wow, a repressive, religiously extreme Middle Eastern country implicated in a terrorist attack on the U.S.? It's no wonder we invaded. Oh but wait, we invaded the country where girls could wear jeans,  go to college - and even smile - without fear of being stoned in the street. It's difficult to find something bad that Iraq did that Saudi Arabia didn't do more of. 

Except that Iraq invaded its neighbours. Twice. Which is straightforward enough, except that the first time we supported them. We even supplied them with weapons and poison gas. And we raised not a grumble when they used them. It was the second time they invaded a neighbour that annoyed us. After all, Britain carved up Mesopotamia and decided to scoop out a little chunk of land and call it Kuwait. <em>We</em> decided the borders of Iraq and they had no place trying to alter them. We only armed them to keep Iran in check, not to do as they please. So when instead of slaughtering Iranians, Marsh Arabs and Kurds, Iraq started menacing Kuwaitis, of course we had to act. It was the only humane thing to do. And we demanded they hand back any of our poison gas they hadn't used yet. The regime might not have changed, but our attitude had. They were no longer the good guys. Besides which, when 9/11 occurred, it would hardly have been good business sense to follow the 9/11 terrorists to their real source - not when Saudi own a huge chunk of the U.S. stock market - not to mention so many of our most lucrative weapon systems. 

But there was a price to pay for doing the right thing, of course. The U.S. is bankrupt, financially and morally, Iraq is now a smoking ruin, its secular culture a thing of the past, and Iran is no longer penned up - in fact it's running half of Iraq these days. We may even have to get involved in another war in a little while when the merged Iran/Iraq menaces our other good pal in the region, that defender of Palestinian rights: Israel. But still, it's the principle of the thing. If a guy wants to buy a girl flowers in a Middle Eastern Muslim country, there's nothing to stop him now. Just provided he's American and he does so within the Green Zone of course.

<hr/>

Wow. The Saudi leadership are believed to have more or less blackmailed Tony Blair into shutting down the British Aerospace bribery investigation by threatening to reduce cooperation in tracking down terrorists. And since the most notorious terrorists to date were Saudis operating with Saudi money, I suppose we need Saudi government 'help' in protecting ourselves from them. The story is <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/15/bae.armstrade"">here</a>. With some countries, we like to urge them towards democracy and offer aid as an incentive. Some other countries we just have to give criminal immunity to because otherwise they might expose us to their terrorists and if we make a fuss about that,  they might not let us pay them huge bribes to buy our weapon systems any more.  It's not <em>as</em> abusive a relationship as the UK has with the US, but it's pretty messed up, no?","","","","2008-02-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Em and I often hear about the sadness of authors who are desperate - or at least very determined - to get published - and very frustrated if it doesn't happen. I'm not talking about Snowbooks' authors (potential or actual); I'm thinking of stories you see in the news or tales you read on someone's blog, often rather heartbreaking ones. 

As with most things, publishing seems less glamorous from the inside (though both Em and I make a point of dressing in snappy 1940s outfits, working only in crisp art deco premises, and making sure our hair is always immaculate).","To some prospective authors, getting published is a portal that leads to a different life, a different world. It is also an acknowledgement, perhaps even a vindication. Or I'm sure it can seem like the chance to earn a living in a way that nourishes rather than withers your soul. In fact I suspect there are as many reasons for wanting to be published as there are authors (or at any rate, more than half a dozen).

What worries Em and me is that from this side of the curtain, on the nuts and bolts side of the book business, the act of being published seems like a very small step into a world which may be just as inhospitable as the unpublished one - perhaps even more so because setbacks become much more personal when your heart's desire is mixed up with your work.

I've sold maybe 75,000 books in a dozen or so languages - I mean ones I've written not published - and I can't say that it's changed anything. Some days I think it proves that I can write, that I know what I'm doing, but then other days I'll think about bad reviews I've had and how completely scornful they can be of my talents and I think perhaps it doesn't prove anything. And you may think to yourself, 'oh, but I won't get bad reviews', because of the quality of your work, but if what you're trying to do is in any way ambitious and original (as opposed to telling fun stories, which is all I try to do) you're even more likely to be floccinaucinihilipilificated*, if for no other reason than that your writing is misunderstood.

And most authors, particularly of literary fiction, won't sell anywhere near 75,000 copies of their work. Ten thousand copies would be pretty good going for a novel. And that isn't enough to live on or get you noticed. And even quite strong sales don't automatically lead on to anything else or open any doors. And, since books are generally bought before they're read, you don't even know how many of your readers enjoyed, or even finished your book.

I know all this is rather depressing for both published and unpublished authors alike - assuming you believe a word of it - but if it makes someone question why they want to be published and have a conversation with themselves about it, then it will be a good thing. Not because I want to put anyone off. Personally, I am forever doing things that are unlikely to succeed, and I'm happier for it. But when you get published one of two things is likely to happen and you need to be prepared for either outcome. Scenario One: nothing changes. It's all a huge anticlimax. The grass still needs cutting, no one takes you any more seriously than they did last week (and your parents still treat you like you're twelve). Or Scenario Two: your book sells enough copies or (more likely) has enough marketing spend behind it to make a splash. You do book signings, radio and press interviews, you give talks. You constantly have to answer questions about your work and you have to talk about what you're working on next. You have to have photos taken of you and then read about what you were like - and probably how attractive you were - in the paper. The good news is that you can now pay bills with money you made from writing. The bad news is that in order to make the same income as a good computer programmer you'll probably have to go on book tours, give Q&As at festivals and meet thousands of people and be judged by them. Someone who wanted fame would be better off being famous for something else. And someone who didn't want fame could certainly finder a better paying job that involved less scrutiny and criticism.

Personally, I think I have it just right. Maybe you don't believe me if I say I wouldn't want Joanna Rowling's success, or even a fraction of it, but I wouldn't. I want to sell few enough books to be virtually unheard of, but still enough that I make minimum wage, or thereabouts, for the time I spend writing. I want obscurity, without total penury. So I think I'm fairly objective about being A Published Author. And the purpose of this post is just to make sure that you are too.

And if anyone out there wants to share their reasons for wanting to be published, I'd love to hear them. A  book deal and a six-figure advance to the best answer. Hmmm. Is that joke funny or just cruel? Anyway, that's publishing for you.

Big day today. On February 14th, 96 years ago, America commissioned its first diesel submarine. It was the <em>USS Skipjack</em>: 135 feet long, with multiple 700hp engines. It wasn't the first diesel submarine in the world; the French had beaten America to that distinction. France had also beaten America in a number of other ways. French was thought to be a better language for lovers than English, (even American-English!). Paris was a  whole city for lovers. Whereas Washington D.C.  was just stuffy and uncomfortable. And America was the home of the brave, but not the amorous. France might have stolen an early lead, but the contest wasn't over yet. America had a secret weapon...","...and that was: scale.  By the start of World War II, America had constructed more submarines than any other nation. And as part of a classic one-two punch, this victory was swiftly followed by a strong marketing push from Hallmark Cards to make February 14 Commercialised Affection Day across the globe. America would finally lead the world in both love and submarines. 
And sure enough, that history is now written, the world has changed and non-spontaneous romantic gestures have come to dominate this day. But I choose to remember a simpler time, a less commercialised time. A time when the U.S. diesel-submarine fleet was still only a beautiful dream. Join me in honouring that memory.

"41476","","1","On the nature of independent publishing","Publish","true","<div class=""pic""><img alt=""pileofbooks.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/pileofbooks.jpg"" width=""115"" height=""117"" /></div>

'Independent publishing' is a term that covers a vast range of companies, and people. Indie publishers range from tiny one or two-man bands, to companies employing fifty to a hundred people. They range from those who use their savings or personal assets to fund the business, to those who are grant-maintained, to those with a wealthy patron, to those who raise debt and equity funding. Their publications range from the deeply specific to the broadest of trade ranges. So it's a bit ambitious to try to pin down what, exactly, an independent publisher is, or should be. But I thought I'd share my own ideal - the company we try every day to build.","First of all, I consider myself to be a business person more than a creative person. The creative side of me might like the romantic idea of sitting in a townhouse in Soho, sipping port and flicking through manuscripts, but that won't make any money. Once you have signed up authors, you have a responsibility to them - and, indeed, to future authors. Your first priority absolutely has to be to make money, or at the very least to maintain cash flow, because without money, you are no use to your authors. Snowbooks goes through phases on the making money side of things, not helped by the spectre of sale or return, but so far, just about, we have maintained our positive cash flow. My sole aim for 2008 is to turn a healthy profit. 

Secondly, I consider the nuts and bolts of the business' processes to be my main role. The last two days have been spent reconciling three bank accounts, ready for the next VAT return, drawing up a contract, sending my weekly ONIX record to Nielsen, making sure my cash flow forecast is in order and going through my invoices due and payments due file to make sure I'm up to date. The smooth running of the business takes priority over anything else. What would happen if I didn't update Nielsen? Customers would not be up to date with our titles. What if I didn't send the VAT return in on time? I'm breaking the law. What if I don't get paid on time? Cash flow suffers. What if I don't pay the printers on time? Why should they bend over backwards to help me, as they do all the time, if I let them down. There's a horrible phrase I remember from my consulting days that described the bare minimum that is acceptable: 'hygiene level'. Having the finances and basic processes under control at all times is a hygiene level requirement. Before Christmas, we had a real squeeze on our cash flow, which I knew about a month before it happened because I pay attention to these things. We told our printer, who very kindly agreed to give us an extra 30 days on a few invoices, which we've now paid after the sales revenue came in after Christmas. If you are on top of these things, you can do something about it when the pinch comes - and by understanding your cash position at all times you make damn sure you don't overspend. 

None of this is to say that I am a paragon of organisational virtue. As I said, this is my ideal, and I get it wrong some of the time. But I think it's really important to understand what your role is, and what you should be aiming for. 

I believe my role is to take someone else's creative output and to apply sufficient business acumen to make it a commercial success. The last thing an author needs is someone who considers themselves equally creative. No - by signing up with a publisher, an author pays for commerciality, business skills, sales skills, marketing skills, sound financial management. It doesn't matter how small the publisher is, or how cutting edge or cool their list: the publisher's job is to run the business properly and make some money for the author. 

It's true - business process work like this is made more palatable because it's easy to believe in books, compared to, say, if I was running an airconditioning unit business. Books are important, lovely to create and easy to get passionate about. But if a publisher considers themself anything other than a business manager, they're on a hiding to nothing.","","","","2008-02-16","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

I have two superpowers. Both of them are stupid.
1) I can catch anything on anything else. I could run through the house with a shoe lace in my hand and get it tangled on a door handle or accidentally pull over a lamp with it.
2) If I look in a shop window a crowd will form behind me and then jostle me out of the way. It doesn't matter if the window only contains car parts or junction boxes and the people behind me are little old ladies who aren't mechanics or electricians. The little old ladies will still become fascinated to know what I am looking at and have to see.","","","","","2008-02-16","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","7"

Have you seen the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/feb/19/workandcareers.worklifebalance"">CMI survey</a> which says British managers work, on average, 40 days of unpaid overtime per year? When I used to work in retail head offices, it was normal to work, say, from 8 until 6:30, with a half-hour lunch break. That would total up to around 50 hours a week. So it was always slightly upsetting when my payslip, along with everyone else's, said 32 hours per week on it. And we weren't eligible for overtime pay because we were too senior (which in my case wasn't really very senior at all). But try to leave at 5:30 and you'd hear cries of 'half day is it?'. If you made a habit of it, you'd be in trouble come annual review time.","It was never clear to me how working only slightly more than one's contracted hours could be seen as under-performing, but that was the culture in every head office I was at. These things always start out temporary and become permanent. And in some places I've worked, the new question was whether people would work some or all of the weekend as well. I imagine that's become even more common now that companies have decent computer networks and laptops for all managers. You can do your unpaid overtime from the comfort of your own home. Perfect.

Wherever I went, I also noticed lots of people 'temporarily' doing a more senior role. If a manager left, one of her subordinates might be asked to take over, but without a pay rise or formal promotion. It was 'good experience', but that situation might last a year or more.

There would also be a few people who left who weren't replaced.  The team would just have to cover the empty slot. Put all these things together and you could run a business using only 80% of the workforce you'd need if you didn't stretch everyone's hours. 

That would allow the wage bill to drop significantly, which is usually the single biggest outgoing in a company. So a culture of unpaid overtime would fund a company's profits for several years. Of course at the end of that period everyone would have to stay permanently on what looked very much like an emergency footing, and the company would have to look somewhere else to make its cuts or boost its income.

And the purpose of all is this miserliness is to keep shareholder dividends up. But increasingly I'm mystified by that idea. If you gave the profits to the staff instead of external shareholders you'd be able to pay them all properly. Which would mean you'd have 100% of your workforce, happy and well motivated, with which to challenge your competitors who were pushing 20% fewer staff to give up their weekends.

Sure, in the early days of a business, shareholder investment is needed, but later on in a company's life, investment is rare. A mature company becomes a cash cow. If the start-up and expansion money came from loans (or bonds) instead of selling off the company as shares, most big businesses would have long since paid it back. 

But doing away with shareholders is unthinkable in the current climate. Why? Because a well run employee-owned company could be sold and milked, yielding a decade's worth of profits. So no one thinks it's strange for a company employing ten thousand people to squeeze most of them in order to pay dividends to faceless external investors. I sometimes imagine a world in which everyone works for minimum wage so that one investor somewhere can own the world. Would we still think of boosting profits in a world like that as 'economic growth'?

Personally, I'd like to see relative tax breaks for large employee-owned businesses, because after all, their profits are going straight into communities. That has to be better for the country than profits which end up overseas or in city funds.

That's why I'm always delighted when John Lewis Partnership defy perennial predictions of their demise and instead thrive. And they do so by rewarding staff and trying to be honest and fair with customers in a way which conventional business wisdom would say is naive to the point of commercial suicide. And yet people notice the difference and they love it. I sincerely hope that in the future more businesses will be employee-owned. Because then, when you pull out all the stops and work weekends, it will be to build up a company whose success includes you and not one in which success means giving as little back as possible.","","","","2008-02-19","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

So, you know that there are two kinds of next generation DVD? Blu-Ray and HD-DVD. Well, <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/feb/19/television.games"">it looks pretty likely</a> that Blu-Ray is about to win and HD-DVD will be dropped. So if you've got a hi-def TV and you want to get a hi-def DVD player to go with it, get a Blu-Ray one. Personally, I'm just wondering what's going to happen to the price of HD-DVD players and discs when all new production and investment ceases and you can't buy them in shops any more. I quite like the idea of snapping up a thousand-pound player for a tenth of that, and buying a few handfuls of hi-def discs for less than the price of standard DVDs. Of course I'll have to go a long way to match my friend Emma H. with her Betamax VCR. But give it a few years. Plus, somewhere I've got a WM-2 (the second model of cassette-playing Sony Walkman ever made) and a couple of tapes for it. In a little while, that's going to be a real curiosity.

I taped <a href=""http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/dispatches/how+the+banks+bet+your+money/1563152"">Channel 4's Dispatches</a> the other night on the banking-driven credit crunch. V. depressing stuff. As you'll remember, it was obvious even to ignorant outsiders <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/07/a_bit_of_economic_cold_water.html"">like me</a> that there was a credit crunch coming and that it would trigger a US recession. But what I didn't realise is that the UK banking sector would see all that high-risk financial dynamite-juggling going on in the States... and rush to join in. But, as one of the MPs interviewed pointed out: we let banks privatise their profits but pass their really big failures on to the general public.  So why wouldn't they want to gamble? [<em>warning: contains highly lefty thinking</em>]","Actually, a lot of industries do that these days - any industry with private-public partnerships in fact - but the financial sector seem to have perfected what I call the profit ratchet. This is where jacking up your business in the short-term gets you a bonus, and even if it leads to the downfall of your firm a few years later, you never have to give that multi-million dollar bonus back. So managers are massively incentivised to do things that in the longer term are bad for the organisations they work for. Profit ratchets caused the Junk Bond problems of the Eighties, they were behind collapses like Enron, MCI, Worldcom etc; and they're going to give us hell in the financial markets in 2008. 

Think of it this way: if you had the choice of steady growth in your industry or a boom and bust cycle, most of us would prefer steady growth. But many in high places would choose boom and bust, because only if they can start a boom will they get mega-bonuses. And there's no inverse-bonus that costs them money in a bust.

So ironically, all those credit agencies who a couple of years back petitioned Pres. Bush to 'reform' the US bankruptcy laws to stop private citizens escaping from crushing debt will any day now be wanting to hand government and the general public as much of their own debt as they can. And the senior managers behind those policies will have grown fabulously rich creating that situation. Lobbyists work hard to get US corporate and capital gains taxes lowered, because they're what get in the way of mega-bonus seekers and speculative investors. Which just leaves income tax in place to raise money so  there'll be funds available when the corporations have losses to unload - or when they want no-bid contracts from old friends who've gone into politics. I've got to say, that while Karl Marx might not have been right about the solution, I can't help thinking he was right about the problem.","","","","2008-02-20","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Isn't Torchwood a confusing program! This season everyone is nice and the team is a team. Hooray! And the plots are sub-standard not abysmal. And the dialogue is poor not woeful. And each week they manage to just about defeat an enemy they massively outnumber rather than be defeated by them. Last time I pointed this out they were tackling fork-lift truck drivers, this week it was...[warning: spoilers]","... an old man with a gun. And like last time, they couldn't take on an uber-baddy like Old Man or Fork-Lift Driver without someone on the team getting shot. And as before the aliens in pain were unfortunately killed not rescued. But still: unlike Season One, it's not all bickering and crushing defeat any more. I do think, though, before a third team member is shot, Cap'n Jack should step forwards and say, 'if you want to shoot someone, shoot me'. You know, what with him being indestructible. Unless it really hurts, in which case I suppose I can understand his continued reluctance.

Also, Em and I were only yesterday discussing the implications of the Einstein Podolsky Rosen (EPR) Paradox as it relates to quantum entanglement* and then it pops up as technobabble on tonight's show. And I totally believe that Martha (who's even more unconvincing as a qualified doctor than Owen) would have heard of it. Totally.

I'm in the process of signing up with a new agent and I've asked them to get me fabulous fabulous screenwriting gigs on Doctor Who. You know, ideally. But I'd probably accept trying to fix Torchwood. I rate the chances of this happening as anorexically slim, but if the previous posts I've written which horribly slag off Torchwood or occasionally Who suddenly disappear from the SnowBlog, it probably means I've at least got a meeting with someone junior at the BBC.

I believe in a few things that might be called conspiracies, but since 'conspiracy' is usually meant as a criticism, I don't think of them in that way. A few examples might be corporations using underhand tactics to get laws changed in their favour, or US Republicans gerrymandering like crazy, or the CIA doing bad things in secret (which is almost their mission if you think about it). I think all of those things happen, I think they are underreported and I don't think that's a conspiracy, so much as 'getting away with it'.","On the other hand, I think men have landed on the moon. In some ways it would actually be cooler if the moon landings were faked - at least as a story. And even if you don't believe the conspiracy, you have to admit some of the evidence the conspiracists dig up is wonderfully tantalising. I'm more skeptical about Lee Harvey Oswald being a lone gunman. But the one I really get stuck on is 9/11. It seems next to impossible that it was an inside job, and fantastically unlikely that the administration turned a blind eye while real terrorists got on with it. On the other hand, there have been so many cover-ups, distortions and white-washes - so many weird facts that don't fit - that every now and then I find myself wondering: if it's not a conspiracy, then what is it? I'd love to know.

The main reason this question comes back to trouble me from time to time is this: the Republicans will lose the 2008 Presidential Election. They don't stand a chance. They might as well concede now. And they will lose control of the Senate too. They've already lost the House. So the Democrats will have a clean sweep and a popular mandate. The only thing that can save Republican politicians is a terrorist attack. Something which they would do anything to prevent. But talk about an incentive to screw up.","","","","2008-02-23","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

So, in my head at least, it's officially the Era of Digital Video. You may think that arrived a while back, but I'm talking about quality good enough to show in a cinema. That movie, <em>Collateral</em>, the one with Tom Cruise riding round in a cab shooting people, was shot largely on HD video, not film. And lately I've been chomping down books on cinematography and editing and, best of all so far, cheap ways to make cool-looking movies. I'm sure it's a sad indictment either on the state of my brain or of the world of fiction, but the funniest thing I've read for ages has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/DV-Rebels-Guide-All-digital-Approach/dp/0321413644/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1203922682&sr=8-1"">a book about super-low-budget film-making</a>.","The book comes with a DVD which includes a little short about a struggling artist who pays his way by working as a hit man. At one point, he upsets the wrong people and outside his window a military-style helicopter descends into view, opens up with its cannons and destroys his apartment. We see the whole thing, despite the fact that there never was a helicopter and nothing got destroyed - except for some fake-glass bottles, which were the most expensive aspect of the scene since they cost over a hundred dollars.

You need a decent video camera and some lenses, so we're still talking several thousand dollars. You could do with a few lights, and you'll need a decent computer and the right software to go with it. So I'm sure you could spend ten thousand dollars getting your kit together. But you could make short movies that look darn good, and they could contain Hollywood-quality CG effects if you're prepared to acquire the skills and put the hours in. Less noticeably, all the other things that Hollywood does to film - like deepening the shadows and adding in a hint of blue, and tweaking the highlights and adding in a little orange, can be done on a fast home computer. Once the shots are in the camera, everything after that point can take place on computer, right up to creating a final master copy of your movie - or just turning it straight into a fully-featured DVD ready for mass production.

It's interesting to think about what this will mean for those of us whose relationship to movies is as consumers and fans, not auteurs. Because if it's a theoretically possibility to make a good looking short for ten thousand dollars, then it's a definite probability that you could make a good-looking movie for half a million pounds of grant money. It would require some creative re-engineering of the film-making process to take advantage of the cost-savings on offer, but it's just the sort of development that could re-vivify the British film industry. Or perhaps the British TV industry. And at the bottom end, it will let all sorts of people experiment with visual storytelling - and while crazy people with cameras are unlikely to produce anything commercially popular, they're bound to generate amazing ideas and inspiration for more mainstream outfits (which is ever the way).

While it's important to put storytelling first, we are at a moment in history where it's worth momentarily putting the technology in the driving seat and thinking about how cheaply one could achieve unimpeachable production values. I'd love to see some public-minded organisation fund a couple of million-pound movies which took a hundred million each worldwide - with the profits plowed back into movie-making. And I'm sure I can't be the only writer who'd enjoy the challenge of writing a dramatically powerful script that just-so-happened to achieve its gorgeously shot thrills-and-spills on a shoestring.","","","","2008-02-25","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

That's the conclusion I'm coming to. If you have a few minutes, I think you might find <a href=""http://www.scribemedia.org/2008/02/20/greener-gadgets-jepsen/"">this presentation</a> by  Mary Lou Jepsen enjoyable - not to say darned inspiring. It's maybe 50 mins, so <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/01/q_does_the_world_need_more_com.html#more"">here are</a> the two minutes of edited highlights if you're short of time. Mary Lou is talking about her <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olpc"">One Laptop Per Child</a> project that I've <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/01/q_does_the_world_need_more_com.html#more"">blogged about</a> before. And I find myself believing what she says and being impressed by her in a way I'd be reluctant to believe a man. Not that I wouldn't, but I'd need more proof. Maybe that's because guys demonstrably do have loads of testosterone in their bloodstream and so most of them can't help turn everything into a competition - at least the guys in charge of things. In fact the silliest example of this is the way most business leaders look at the way their corporations embody the cooperation of thousands of people towards a common goal, and what do they see? They see competition. That's the key to business. And yet without cooperation they'd be sitting at home giving the competition speech to their dogs. Anyway, I want women like Mary Lou Jepsen running the world, before competition means we don't have much of a world left. And I'm considering suggesting that Testosterone become a banned substance.","<hr/>

Snippets from Mary Lou's talk that I love: she talks about how these laptops can run on a huge variety of power sources. I have a shoe box full of power adaptors for phones, clocks and gadgets. I love the idea that I could grab any one of them and run an XO laptop.

I love how the Open Source approach to software development always seems to beat what you can achieve if you spend lots of money. It's still not a well-known enough story and I really recommend the old classic book <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cathedral-Bazaar-ES-Raymond/dp/0596001088/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204030272&sr=8-1"">The Cathedral and The Bazaar</a> if you have any interest in that side of things. Use volunteer geniuses, not paid ones, and share everything instead of hiding it, and your bugs get fixed in a tiny fraction of the time the best closed-organisations in the world can achieve and your ability to innovate, because of how ideas are offered up and spread, matches the best that's out there.

Plus, on a more socialist note, Mary Lou shies away a couple of times from the topic, but if the only projects the human race will tackle are the ones that a private profit can be made from, we're all in so much trouble. We can't fix the environment unless companies can get rich off it. We can't help third-world kids get educated unless companies can get rich off it. But isn't the point of our capitalist economy to improve everyone's lives and to encourage progress? On the occasions when the profit motive actually stands in the way of higher living standards and new innovations, don't we have to find a way to fix that rather than just shrug and say, 'well, that's the free market for you'? Mary Lou hints at what Silicon Valley would be like if the thousands of engineers there were allowed to pool their ideas instead of being forbidden from doing so. I can't help thinking that if we all had rewarding, intellectually stimulating roles in morally exemplary projects as part of supportive communities - which is exactly what the OLPC project is - the fact that no one got stinking rich off it wouldn't seem that important. And, really, what would we need to be rich <em>for</em> if we had those things?","","","","2008-02-26","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

I'm pregnant!","Yes, thought that would make you choke on your morning coffee. Depending on whether you believe me or the doctor, I'm 8 or 10 weeks along, so still very early days - but I figured if anything goes wrong, I wouldn't be able to disguise my sadness from the blog, so what's the point in keeping it a secret. 

So all being well it's due end of September, beginning of October. Tragedy! I can't go to Frankfurt! Anna is nobly stepping into the breech and will pound the corridors on her own. 

As far as what happens after that: well, you mothers out there can scoff and tell me I'm dreaming, but I plan on not too much changing. I shall have the best part of two, maybe three months off (October and November), then I shall get a nice mother's help type lady in to help me with cleaning, and showing me which way up a baby goes.  Remember, I work from home four out of five days already (which I'll extend to five) so I will be at home anyway. I'm going to be very cruel about non-crucial commitments, like parties, dinners, meetings with people I don't really want to meet with (which I have quite a few of), to keep things under control, which is about a quarter of my time at the moment. And sure, I'll be utterly knackered, but I'm hoping that this baby will be the same as I was when I was little - Very Good Indeed. 

Speaking of being utterly knackered, this pregnancy lark really takes its toll. I have been sick as a dog for three weeks now, and more tired than you could believe. I haven't posted here much in the last few weeks because all I can think of is explaining exactly how sick I feel, and how I've eaten mostly ginger cake, ginger beer, ginger nuts, ginger tea, ginger cordial, ginger, and lots of cheese on toast - and that would have given the game away, somewhat. 

So, like I say, it's early days and if the books are to be believed there are a million things that can go wrong, so I'm just keeping my fingers crossed. Words of support if you work and also have a child most welcome!","","","","2008-02-29","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","31"

If you let people read an electronic copy of your book for free, will that increase or decrease demand for the printed copies you want to sell? The first thought is that, well, giving anything away for free means someone isn't paying for it who might otherwise have done so. But then radio gives songs away for free and that's seen as one of the best ways of boosting sales of paid-for versions of the same thing. But that's music not books. Cory Doctorow gives <a href=""http://craphound.com/index.php?cat=5"">electronic copies</a> of his books away and he reckons it generates word-of-mouth and so gives an important boost to his printed sales.

Except that Cory's books are available formatted for your phone, your iPod, your PDA and your whizzy e-book reader. <em>American Gods</em> is available for your computer screen and nothing else. So it's not really any sort of test. We already know most people don't want to sit at their computers to read a book. Why are Harper Collins doing it like that? Presumably it's to stop illegal copying. But why give a book away 'for free' then? Plus, <a href=""http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/01/free-download-of-nei.html"">as Cory pointed out</a>, the book is already available illegally if you want it. He downloaded the whole text of the book illegally (as a test) while waiting for Harper Collins's hamstrung reader to load page one of the legal version. When only eight people read <em>American Gods</em> on their computers, will that prove something?","","","","","2008-03-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

You'all know that Rob and I are big fans of technology, and that Snowbooks exists because computers are our friends - extra kind friends who do all our work for us. And amongst all the warring, and poverty, and corruption in the world at least we can point to the Internet and say 'hey! The Internet!

But I just thought I'd share this with you. I have evidence that there are people in the world for whom the digital revolution has yet to happen, and there are no signs that it will happen any time soon. It would be a little too cruel to explain exactly how I know this, but isn't it amazing that there are people in the world, not in their 70s or 80s but in their 30s and 40s - some of whom may or may not be in charge of educating the next generation, I couldn't possibly say - who honestly, hand on heart, don't know what a blog is. They daren't shop online because it's 'risky' and they would rather have a printed newspaper or printed product catalogue than the online version. 

Of course, the digital revolution is exciting, and presents opportunities (and threats to those who ignore it), and don't you think it would be cool if ebooks took off, and pity the poor business who doesn't have a decent website. But I think it's fascinating that there are tens of thousands of people out there who are not online, don't have broadband and still read. I think they're weird, sure - but they exist.

It's only once you've lived with a crappy laser printer for a year or so that you can truly appreciate the wonder that is a good printer. And so I would like to share with you the name of our current printer. It is an HP Laserjet 4250. It is fast, economical, totally robust and reliable, did I mention fast, does duplex, and is all round a joy to print on. Having almost got to the weeping stage at several times with previous printers - and I'm sure you know what I mean - I think it's worth the 475 plus 100 toner.

In a <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080304-book-lovers-have-emotional-bond-with-paper.html"">recent survey</a> by UK media lawyers Wiggin, a few questions related to electronic versus paper books. People are more attached to their books than they are to their satellite television, radio stations, newspapers, magazines, social networks, video games, blogs, DVDs, and P2P file-swapping. 53 percent of respondents said that they would ""never"" or would ""hate"" to stop using paper books, and another 24 percent said they would be ""uncomfortable."" 39 percent of the respondents said that electronic reading devices were appealing or very appealing, but 61 percent had the opposite reaction. Hmm. Personally, I'd have liked the follow-up question to have been 'and have you actually used one?'. But people aren't likely to use one if they think they know they won't like it.

""People dont listen to companies, they listen to people.""

""Interact with your best customers""

""People care very much about the tribal identification""

""For everybody under eighteen years old, its either free or its something I really want and Im willing to pay for it. There's nothing in the centre. ""

""Magazines are dead...but you can make a fortune with Playstation magazines, PC gaming [magazines], Game Informer, because there are silos of people who care a great deal.Magazines make 10x return on equity of books, you know why? Because magazines have subscribers and books dont. So every time a book comes out they gotta run around looking for someone to buy it. Whereas the magazine people just look for the next author to write the next article. ""

""There is a lot of music I like. There is not so much music I love. We gotta stop making music people like. There is an infinite amount of music people like. No one will ever go out of the way to hear, to pay for, music they like.""

""I want to argue that the next model is tribal management.""

Risk. There's a lot of it about in publishing. And generally startups have more to fear from the unknown than bigger, older companies. Big + old = stability + reserves. New + little = precarious + financially stretched. So on the one hand, a lot of innovation comes from startups, on the other so does a lot of risk.

We often talk about how the big companies need to work with independents both for mutual benefit and for the future of the industry, but what about independents working together? In the past, I've always liked the idea of us little people helping each other out. But that's before I reminded myself about the sources of risk. If your next cheque is coming from a precarious independent there's a bigger chance that something will go wrong and it will never arrive. Likewise if you're a new author signed to a startup: there's a bigger likelihood they won't be around when it's time to launch your book.

Worse still, if an independent runs into trouble, it might find its smaller creditors much easier to ignore than the larger ones with legal teams. The result might be that the knock-on effect hits the little people disproportionately harder.

This is not just hypothetical. Lately we've spoken to a few people - freelancers and authors - who are probably going to be left in the lurch by an independent currently struggling to pay its bills and fulfil its obligations. I still think it's right to support our fellow independents, but it will be a tragedy if the collapse of one fledgling venture causes havoc across a network of freelancers, first-time authors and independent suppliers.","","","","","2008-03-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Well, we were, actually. <em>Boy A</em> from Serpent's Tail won the Spread the Word competition. And - guess what - it had been made into a film by <a href=""http://www.channel4.com/video/boy-a/index.html"">Channel 4</a>, had won prizes and was already selling well, in debut fiction terms. Ergo, people had heard of it, ergo they voted for it. From the press release: 

""Originally published in 2004, by small independent publisher Serpents Tail, <em>Boy A</em> initially enjoyed modest sales. Sales were boosted when an adaptation of the book was aired on Channel 4 in October 2007. ...[Jonathan Trigell's] first novel, <em>Boy A</em>, won the prestigious John Llewellyn Rhys Prize for best work in the Commonwealth by an author under 35, and the Waverton Good Read Award, also for best first novel of 2004.""

I'm disappointed and actually a bit cross. The whole point of this competition was to uncover hidden gems. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.

<em>Rob's comment:</em> I think the stated purpose of the award was to find a book  'which inspires debate and discussion among readers' and I suspect a book about a juvenile killer would do exactly that. Even so, there's a valuable warning to be had here, as you can see: don't stand between Em and a prize for one of our authors.

I know I shouldn't give in to this sort of thing, but the sheer number of people I'm waiting to hear back from is making me paranoid. Good friends, who didn't reply to e-mails asking them if they were OK because it had been a while since I'd heard from them (fortunately they were fine). Business partners (not you, Em) who've promised to get in touch and haven't. People who are mulling over book collaborations for such a long time, I can't help thinking they've forgotten about them. I'm also waiting to hear back on holiday dates from a friend, script feedback from another friend (not you, Emma H., someone else), borrowed DVDs, ordered books. It's silence from people I'm close to and new acquaintances alike. I'm waiting on at least a dozen different things in all. Weirdly, even the spam e-mails have slowed to a trickle (though I'm not complaining about that). But I am starting to wonder if I'm turning invisible. (Hmm.

Just in case anyone's interested, I thought I'd tell you about a project I've been working on. Yes, it's foolish and pointless. But I've learned a lot. But before I get into that, does anyone have a postal address for Neil Gaiman? (here's my <a href=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/robmail.jpg"" onclick=""window.open('http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/robmail.jpg','popup','width=180,height=70,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=150,top=150'); return false"">e-mail</a> if you do.) I'm not stalking him, but I happened to read about how disappointed he was with the way his Neverwhere TV project turned out in the mid-Nineties. So I thought I'd do something about that...","As you may recall, I've been thinking about all things video of late. And I've been amazed at what can be done using a home PC and some visual effects software. So I thought I'd see if I could fix some of the problems with Neverwhere.

The BBC shot it on video. But according to the story, they lit it for film. Whether that was because the video thing was a last-minute change, I'm not sure, but the result looks pretty bad: dim with low contrast and harsh highlights. According to Neil, the BBC soothed his initial concerns by saying they'd run the finished video through some process to correct the bad lighting. But they didn't. So it still looks awful ten years later if you buy the BBC DVD.

For anyone out there who knows Photoshop, what I've done is to Photoshop episode one of Neverwhere. Except that for moving images Adobe offer After Effects, instead of Photoshop, though many of the adjustments you can make are the same. I've been adjusting levels, and saturation and color balance. I've also been screening off parts of the image (called 'matting') and applying adjustments to light a character's face more clearly or make a sick person look a little less robustly healthy.

Nighttime street scenes now have hard blues in them. Sunlight is softer. The baddies have a harsh yellow cast to them that looks a lot less boring than the monochromatic original. When underground, lights glow rather than glare now. And when the BBC got bored with washed-out colour and threw a massive purple light over everything, I've dialled it back down to a bearable mauve wash. Skin tones throughout are now good when they're supposed to be good and bad when they're supposed to be bad. I've even had a go at making the featureless off-white of the London sky look more interesting by blending in a ramp (what Photoshop would call a gradient). The effect is a little unrealistic, but then the story by this point has moved to the realm of the fantastic.

I've also tried my hand at a couple of little visual effects. When someone does something supernatural, now you can see it as well as hear it. It's not wonderful, but it's better than nothing - and I'm still only learning.

Here are a few stills to illustrate (though I've fixed the whole first episode). Original on the left; my version on the right:

So, has anyone got any suggestions for how to get a DVD of my version to Mr. Gaiman? I can't fix the editing and the various other problems he's identified, but I like to think that the whole enterprise looks considerably better - not to mention more expensive. Not bad, consider it didn't cost any money to do.

<i>Update:</i>: While I'm pretty happy with the results of my tweaking, I'm finding it really difficult to judge colours and brightness without a reference monitor. I think my versions are still an improvement, but they're sometimes only marginally better on my TV, when burned to disc, compared with how good they looked on my monitor as I was making adjustments. Might need to give this some more thought.","","","","2008-03-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

But still, it would be more than a little bit cool to own a book about space exploration written in 1900 that spent part of 2008 orbiting the Earth.

Some days I miss the Internet of ten years ago. In those days I used to be able to order a book from Amazon and get it the next day. Every week that went by brought some new, cool online service. And best of all, everyone was talking about the 'last mile' and how to make it less of a problem. Getting things delivered to people's homes would need a new infrastructure. Couriers would re-invent themselves, home builders would install little outdoor safes where your purchases could be stored until you got home. Concierges would enjoy a renaissance. In those days we were only a couple of years away from solving all those home delivery niggles. But stuck here in 2008 the outlook is a lot less promising.","No one has any solutions to last mile problems any more. And the online firms have turned Web buzz into business as usual. My order might take five days to process. My delivery might take two weeks to arrive. The postage and packing might cost more than the contents. The thing is, I really want my book order that was 'completed' on Monday to arrive. But I can't complain to Amazon yet because the order delivery 'estimate' runs for another ten days. But if a book takes two weeks to turn up, the chances that I will have walked past a bookshop selling it become very high. I call that likelihood the Encounter Frequency. If you have to wait too long for something, you'll probably encounter it naturally on your travels, either when you visit a big supermarket or a regional shopping centre. Bestsellers have high encounter frequencies; you pass them everywhere. Esoteric books, like the one I've ordered, you stumble upon less often. But if my book doesn't arrive by the next time I go into London, there'll have been no point in me ordering it online and paying for shipping. I could have read it on the train on the way home. And I'll be even less likely to order online next time. Roll on 1999, I say.","","","","2008-03-08","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"
"41514","","1","Unfiltered","Publish","true","Just a little political observation about negative campaigning.","Personally, whenever I hear a political story I try to ask myself, why now? Because in many cases, similar stories go unreported. There's usually a reason for a particular narrative or theme emerging. I'm thinking especially of the way editorials all over the world are discussing how negative the Obama vs. Clinton race is becoming and what a problem that is. In 2004, the networks all picked up the fake Swift Boat story of John Kerry not really being a Vietnam hero. This wasn't seen as a negative campaign tactic. Of course that was partly because it wasn't directly a product of the incumbent's campaign - but neither were the indirect links to the campaign widely reported. Moreover the story had no substance and yet the news organisations didn't dispel the claims until later, they just reported them. Unfounded accusations were slung in that contest and somehow they successfully cast doubt on the fitness of the accused. But now it's 2008, and both front-runners are Democrats, and as well as the mud sticking, the act of slinging it is seen as simultaneously backfiring on the accuser. It's about the only way to portray two strong Democratic candidates as a bad thing: claim that they're destroying each other and their own integrity with their ugly campaigning. Most of the time in negative campaigns it's the slur that gets reported, but when it's Democrat on Democrat, suddenly the tactic is seen as backfiring. But the truth is that negative campaigning works extremely well, providing the media play along. Just watch what the news corporations do when a pro-corporate candidate tries slinging a little mud. I've said it many times before, but you can't expect global news organisations, who depend for their existence on pro-corporate legislation, to be even-handed when it comes to losing their allies in government.","","","","2008-03-09","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Em was at the IPG/IPA awards last night in Brighton and she just called and asked me to pass on some important news, only I can't remember what it was.  I remember she said that her husband, Andy, looked lovely in his new DJ last night.  And I know she said they had a lovely walk along the beach this morning. And I recall her saying that everyone was really nice and friendly. 

I know there was one other thing. It's on the tip of my tongue. Anyway, if I remember what it was, I'll update this post. Hope everyone's having a good weekend.","","","","","2008-03-09","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Wheeeee! I can't tell you how chuffed I am to announce that Rob, Anna and I, aka Snowbooks, won the Independent Trade Publisher of the Year at the Independent Publishing Awards last night, held during the Independent Publisher's Guild conference. How exciting!

//Update//

I've just got a press release from the organisers, and here's what they said about Snowbooks: 

""Snowbooks' award caps its rapid rise in publishing since it was set up in 2003. Judges liked its energetic marketing and publicity and its efforts to build close relationships with retailers and other partners in the trade. Snowbooks' lively website and design service for other publishers were also both praised. ""The energy of this energetic publisher fizzes off the page,"" said the judges. ""It's a very innovative company, great to work with, and likely to sustain its early growth in the years ahead."" ""

Isn't that nice? (And they spelled it right, and got the possessive apostrophes right, and everything!)","It was a really lovely evening from the start because it was in Brighton where the IPG conference was held, which is full of healthful sea air, and Andy my husband travelled down to come to the dinner and awards. So I got to see him in the aforementioned DJ which was very appealing. And I had new patent purple shoes and an utterly gorgeous handbag (thanks, Joan!) which were fabulous. Then we poled along to the drinks reception, and I got to introduce Andy to a bunch of people, thus confirming in his mind finally that I do not simply, in fact, go to the park every day and feed the pigeons (unless I'd undertaken a very elaborate and well planned ruse that involved bribing total strangers in advance to pretend that they knew me). Dinner was superb, and huge, heartfelt thanks to Chris R and Ros from Bertrams who were our gracious hosts and are wonderful people. Then the awards bit of the evening was hosted by Hardeep Singh Kohli who is a very funny man from t'radio (and Celebrity Masterchef, as I'm led to believe). He did a bit of a turn, then announced the first award, which was the Indie Trade Publisher of the Year. And presto, it was us! 

I was genuinely, truly not expecting it, because I thought the boys at Summersdale would walk it since they're a company I rate higher than any, and my resultant lack of planning led to a bit of confusion. Being the first award, there was no precedent set for how you got onto the stage or what you did. So I stepped up onto the stage (it was only about a foot off the ground) to the alarm of the organisers (not health and safety appropriate, apparantly - should have used the steps twenty foot away) and had my photo taken in a complete daze, then a lady ushered me off the stage. It was only once I'd got back to my seat that I thought 'Eek! Glasses! Speech!"" I'm long sighted so I'd had my glasses on to watch the proceedings, and forgot to take them off for a PHOTO. Disaster. And I also forgot to do any sort of speech (yes, I was stupefied and stupid but, admittedly, I wasn't offered the podium), which made me sad because I thought immediately afterwards that I could have thanked Andy for supporting me and being so wonderful. So here is my acceptance speech, a day late: 

""Eeeeeek!""

Hmm. Tick for emotional content, but needs polish. Let's try again, with less adrenaline. 

""There is an adage that 80% of small businesses fail in the first five years. Snowbooks will be five years old on 1st April of this year - so we only have to get through another 22 days and we've made it! 

[Appreciative laughter, ripple of applause.]

On behalf of my fellow Snowbookers, Rob and Anna, I would like to thank all the readers, retailers and wholesalers, authors and suppliers who support us so brilliantly. Without them we'd be nothing. I'd also like to thank those friends and colleagues whose advice, support and friendship means so much and is so crucial. 

And most of all, I'd like to thank my wonderful parents and my husband, Andy, who has believed in us since before the beginning; who has never lost patience; who is always there with wise words and kindness; whose sacrifices mean I get to live my dream."" 

Good job I forgot, really. I'd have welled up and gone all Gwyneth. 

Erg! Forgot to thank the cats:

And then we had champagne, huge thanks again to Chris R (although muggins here had to live vicariously through others, on account of my condition) and had lots of lovely chats with lots of lovely people. It was one of those sorts of evenings. Pretty perfect.","","","","2008-03-09","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","12"

This is a very good Monday. I'm thrilled to announce that <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9781905005581.html"">The Red Men</a> is on the shortlist for the prestigious Arthur C Clarke award, in some very fine company. Click below for the full shortlist.","<em>The Red Men</em>

Tom Hunter, administrator for the Arthur C. Clarke Award said:

""The announcement of a new Clarke Award shortlist is always a highlight of the UK's science fictional calendar, and this year's list, featuring an all UK line-up of top authors, promises to continue this trend.

""Featuring visions as diverse as a dystopian Cumbria and a future Hackney, time-travel adventures in 1960's Liverpool and an alternate world British Isles in the throes of terrorist attack, through to tech-noir thrillers and a trawl through subconscious worlds where memories fall prey to metaphysical sharks, the Clarke Award has never been so close to home and relevant to the British literary scene. 

""The Clarke Award has always been about pushing at the speculative edges of its genre. It's one possible map amongst many, never the whole territory, and this year's shortlist stands as both the perfect introduction to the state of modern science fiction writing as well as a first tantalising glimpse of possible futures to come."" 

The prize will be announced at a ceremony on 30th April, by which time I will be even fatter than I am now, so that'll be a fun sartorial challenge. Huge thanks to the judges and good luck Matthew!","","","","2008-03-10","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

"41522","","1","U.S. Economic Troubles","Publish","true","","The U.S. will have spent well over two trillion dollars on the Iraq war by the time it's all over. Some very smart people believe the total will reach about three trillion. That's enough money for almost anything you can think of. Almost anything. It's enough to make sure no one in the world goes hungry or thirsty again. It's enough to cure goodness knows how many diseases. It's enough money to make a good start on exploring the solar system. It's enough money to do all the research required on understanding climate change as well as developing a suite of technologies for tackling the problem. It might even be enough money to cure cancer if it were spent wisely. Not that anyone would have got permission to do any of those things. You need a lot of permission to do good and it's unpopular, whereas to start a war you need answer to no one. But even if the U.S. had just put the money in the bank instead of spending it on hurting Iraqis it would come in pretty handy right now. The U.S. has 11 trillion dollars in mortgages outstanding and the credit crunch and the coming recession is going to imperil a not inconsiderable fraction of them. Three trllion would be enough to allow the government to buy out all the diciest mortgages, thus ensuring that no one important in the financial community suffered because of the reckless gambling of the last few years. And given that the government is probably going to do that anyway, it would probably be nice if they had the money to pay for it.","","","","2008-03-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Snowbooks hasn't done much with e-books. We've offered them for sale through a third party, but we haven't got creative. We're not <i>exactly</i> getting creative now, but we're thinking it's about time we put out at least one title that that can be downloaded for free.

I wonder if the saga of The Friday Project is finally coming to an end. According to their insolvency firm (quoted in a <a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/news/54786-talks-continue-over-friday-project.html"">Bookseller article</a>), their list is currently being sold off. I don't believe that publishers sell off their titles shortly before making a comeback. I think it's safe to say that they are being wound down.","Perhaps it's considered inappropriate to idly speculate on such things, but I'm not not just indulging in gossip. In past years, I've put a lot of work into keeping The Friday Project going. I've taken heaps of IT support calls at odd times and spent many dozens of hours unclogging e-mail, resurrecting their website and crawling under desks with bits of cable (favours for which they very kindly ended up reimbursing me). We are also one of their creditors (among other things we've handled some of their cover design), although we are realistic about our chances of seeing that money. Not to mention that Scott Pack, who had been so personally supportive of us when he was at Waterstone's, and who we'd got to know in those days, made the move to become their commercial director. It's our personal belief that without his influence The Friday Project (TFP) would have long since gone under. So I don't feel my interest is <em>idle</em> and I also tend to think that when a firm is in debt, insolvent, in administration and its assets are being 'disposed of', it also isn't <em>speculation</em> to suggest that they're being shut down*.

Besides Snowbooks, I've only known two other small businesses with any familiarity and both of them have hit problems and become slow torture for those involved. Small firms are labours of love and if they founder, which they often do, it's a wrenching experience. Anyone considering embarking on such a venture would be well advised to put themselves in Scott's and Clare's shoes and to think how difficult it must be for them. Once all this is concluded, I hope Clare is able to find a job without the stress and the demands she inherited when she found herself in sole charge of TFP. And I hope Scott gets some credit for the solid work he did in keeping a leaky ship afloat as long as he did. Just thinking about it is enough to stop Em and I grumbling that Snowbooks isn't more profitable and instead have us feeling relieved that we're not having to speak with disappointed staff and authors about their futures. Regardless of mistakes that may have been made in the past, it's not a situation I would wish on anyone.

"41527","","1","U.S. Inflation","Publish","true","","I don't know what percentage of cheap goods sold in Walmart are made in China. I remember reading it was over a third some time back. Isn't it amazing you can do your manufacturing halfway round the world more cheaply than at home. I don't know how common that is, but it made think about the effect the wilting dollar will have on U.S. inflation. My guess is that in most inflationary situations, foreign imports are luxury goods, as far as the average household is concerned. So you switch to home-grown products. But America has been using China as its industrial heartland for some years now. And only China's policy of reinvesting the dollars it receives back into the U.S. has kept their exchange rates favourable for that situation to continue. So what happens now as the U.S. is forced to cut interest rates (making U.S. investment less attractive) and weakening the dollar? The cost of Chinese goods will already be rising. And as it rises, it will increase the price not just of foreign luxuries but of a thousand everyday items. Which will hit poor families hardest. They're also the families who rely on stores like Walmart for jobs. Did shifting exchange rates ever target the cost of living so accurately? Add in the fact that the sub-prime crisis is also most worrying for those with low incomes and I think that this is not a good time to be poor in America.

Maybe it will play out like post-War Britain. This time next year, America will have a major recession on its hands and for the first time in a long while a Democratic majority in both houses and a Democrat president. Maybe for America, just as it was for us, the time will be right for universal healthcare and a strengthening of the social safety net. (That's if the processes Naomi Klein talks of in the Shock Doctrine still allow some good to come from a crisis.)","","","","2008-03-14","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

I don't know much history - certainly not much before about 1950. I was positively disbelieving when I first learned that Britain had taken time out from fighting Napoleon to nip over to Denmark, shell Copenhagen and steal their navy. That was 1807. The ultimate indignity is that most Brits don't even remember it as being part of our history. Anyway, as far as I know, we didn't cause Denmark any real problems for another 190 years. But then...","...I just watched a program about the incredible combination of bridge and tunnel that linked Denmark and Sweden for the first time just after the millennium. It was an absolutely extraordinary feat of engineering, made somewhat more difficult by the fact that when dredgers scooped out sea-bed for the tunnel and used it to built up an artificial island for the start of the bridge, some of what looked like chunks of mud and rock turned out to be bombs. Big ones. How did they get there? Well, apparently at the end of World War II, the R.A.F. put on a celebratory air show for the Danes, complete with live bombing runs over open water. Many of the bombs didn't detonate. Fifty years later, these huge, unstable canisters of TNT were still there, ready to disrupt progress and threaten the lives of the bridge workers. They had to painstakingly locate and remove sixteen of them. Still, the last time the British military were in the area, they blew up 30% of Copenhagen and killed two thousand people; this time all they did was cost millions in delays, imperil a few dozen lives and jeopardise the greatest engineering project the country had ever participated in - and that by accident. I wonder what we'll do for them next.","","","","2008-03-15","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"
"41531","","1","U.S. Economy","Publish","true","","To loosen up the markets where liquidity is a problem, particularly following the collapse of Bear Stearns stock, the U.S. Federal Reserve has earmarked <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080311/bs_nm/usa_fed_liquidity_dc_6"">$400 billion</a> in funds which it will use to do things like guarantee otherwise dubious investments, such as sub-prime related loans. It seems unlikely to acquire much of material value in exchange, beyond some hearty gratitude from a few major campaign contributors who would otherwise be facing the consequences of their reckless investment decisions. In other words, this is a stealthy bailout using public money (by the staunchest supporters of the free-market). 

Given that this is just the first of these collapses, it's going to get expensive quickly. I've only just finished boggling at the extent to which America has been running its economy on credit, the fact that it's committed itself to costs of $3 trillion over Iraq - and now it's spent another $400 billion in just a few days.  I can't imagine how these bills are going to get paid. 

Massive worldwide investment in the U.S. at low interest rates just doesn't seem like it's going to be as popular in 2008 as it's been for the early years of this century. And as for America earning the money rather than borrowing it (quaint as that idea sounds), I'm just not seeing that either. Even then, someone would probably have to put corporate and capital gains tax rates back where they used to be - which isn't going to happen while there's a Republican in the White House. And anyway, the latest economic figures aren't good. If only congress had let President Bush dump the entire Social Security fund into the stock market as he'd wanted. Burning the furniture would have kept investors toasty for a while longer. As it is, with oil at record prices, I have no idea how an administration with zero track record in economic stewardship is going to avert a comprehensive crisis.

The only wild schemes which occur to me concern Bush Senior's old mentor Richard Nixon. Who, the story goes, didn't like anyone dating his daughter, but let G.W. Bush do so, on occasion, so close were the families. It's not an alliance the Bush family ever seems to allude to. But perhaps, like Pres. Nixon, it's time for G.W. Bush to hop on a plane to China and try to do a deal. In Nixon's time, it made him appear statesmanlike and stopped the press from giving him a hard time (because they couldn't very well undermine him as he was playing ambassador). Could it work for the current incumbent? Is there a trade/investment deal to be done and is he the man to do it (all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding)? Or will he just look on as the recession hits, just as he did when Katrina hit, and try to think of a way to blame it on Al Qaeda?

An aside, and rather an impertinent one (though hopefully neither the man concerned nor his friends or family will read my words) but take a look at the guy running Bear Stearns, Mr. James Cayne:

Tomorrow's my first ultrasound appointment, so Andy and I are Having the Day Off (yes, you heard me) and getting the train up to Big London first thing. I am, naturally, nervous, about finding out whether it has the requisite number of limbs, heads etc. I was talking to my mum about it today, who said that in her day (she didn't use that phrase) they used a brass trumpet. Hmm. I wonder what they'll use in another 34 years time?

I've mentioned this before, but ever since I started trying to write pretty words, I've found my enjoyment of other people's writing has diminished. Instead of getting swept up with the story, I find myself inwardly debating whether I would have used a particular word or phrase or style. How would I have written that? Would that have worked better? Would I be capable of writing that last paragraph? How long would I be able to maintain that tone?

It's entertaining in its own way, but not what reading fiction is supposed to be about. In some ways that makes it a good thing, purely from my point of view, that Snowbooks is trying to point itself in the direction of more non-fiction - simply because it's a safer business proposition. But I don't suppose our partial re-alignment will please 'fans' of this blog, because talk of writing here almost always means novels. But I am perennially interested to know your non-fiction predilections. Since the last time I asked, has anyone tucked into a good non-fiction tome and learned anything juicy or thrilling or mind-boggling?

I just read this poor fellow's <a href=""http://www.erasmushobart.com/blog/?p=31"">blog post</a> about the tenterhooks on which he finds himself over the changing status of his publisher, The Friday Project (TFP).  Reporting of the TFP situation has formerly focussed on the takeover angle. And then latterly, some figures about the sorts of debts involved have surfaced. Setting aside my earlier thoughts about the <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/03/fridays_project_is_full_of_woe.html"">tragedy of all this</a> and focussing only on the finances, what would it take to save The Friday Project?","Well, firstly someone would have to pay off their debts. I'm basing this all on sketchy public domain info, but let's just assume that their debts are at least the size of their cumulative losses, in which case we're talking about  maybe 800k <a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/news/54786-talks-continue-over-friday-project.html"">from recent reports</a>. Then a buyer would need to inject enough capital to make the company solvent again. Wouldn't that have to involve a few hundred thousand more? Call it a bare minimum of a million pounds assuming the shareholders are happy to turn over control for free. But if the company's front list suggests it's poised for greatness, wouldn't they want at least a few pence on the pound? And if the front list isn't promising, then why would a buyer be interested?. (The only clue we have here is that existing investors have not seen fit to make more funds available and new shareholders have not presented themselves, which is not a particularly good sign.) At any rate, I could easily arrive at a figure approaching 1.5million while still being fairly optimistic about unknown levels of debt. That seems a lot to pay when we add in the fact that the company is insolvent currently, so its future publications schedule will be all over the map. I personally can't see anything resembling a 'takeover' or a 'sale' occurring. The administrators have hinted as much by talking of multiple purchasers. To me it seems fairly clear that the list is being sold off as part of bankruptcy proceedings and not with the intention of maintaining a going concern. This is a point of view, not a statement of fact, but I think those who are anxiously waiting for news should factor it into their expectations.

<hr/>

<em>Update:</em>
 Though the latest shareholders' newsletter on the TFP site is still dated January 2007, I did notice that Clare Christian, TFP's MD, had posted the following comment to one of the <a href=""http://tfpsgirlfriday.blogspot.com/2008/03/another-week.html"">posts</a> on her <a href=""http://tfpsgirlfriday.blogspot.com/"">personal blog</a>. I imagine there are plenty of people who could miss it there, so I've reproduced her words here:

<span style=""color: maroon;"">""Thanks everyone. I can answer one query. TFP has appointed an administrator and will be put into liquidation following a creditors meeting on 31 March. I can comment on the status of the sale in as much as we are in discussions and those discussions are pretty much complete but the publisher concerned are sticking to no comment until the deal is done so I suppose I have to too. Which is pretty ridiculous really as it appears that everyone else can name them and in fact the administrator has reported it today...""</span>

It's a strange situation when the administrators can state that HarperCollins are negotiating to buy some of TFP's assets, but TFP themselves apparently aren't allowed to comment. 

I think most of us have guessed this by now, but it's a confirmation that we're talking about a 'liquidation' here.

Does anyone know much about bankruptcy proceedings? For the benefit of authors, does anyone know whether it's normal for publishing contracts to be reassigned or sold without it voiding the contract or requiring the author's permission? And for the benefit of creditors (like us), does anyone know in what order debts are usually paid? Because I think it's clear that the money raised from liquidating TFP's list will not cover all the outstanding debts. I know how loyal the TFP office staff have been and I'd hate to think of them losing out on wages (no joke on editorial salaries when living in London). On the other hand, I know that some of TFP's creditors are freelancers for whom fees are effectively wages too. 
(In case anyone is worried on our behalf, we should say that if our TFP invoices never get paid it will be painful, but not dangerous to our company.)","","","","2008-03-18","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","8"

Apart from making me bemused, because I thought it was quite straightforward, misspelling makes it hard to track our press and blog coverage. 'Snowbooks' is a good, unique term to search for.

Thought I'd let you know what my plans for maternity matters are, in case you need to know.","From now until 1st July, it's business as usual. I am working full time, as ever, and engaging in consulting services as well. <a href=""mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"">Holler</a> if you want a good website or to learn how to make the most of your ONIX data! 

From 26 weeks' pregnant, which is 3rd July - I'll be taking it a bit easier than I do now, although still working full time - except not at weekends. That means all major projects will be finished by now, like four-colour non-fiction books for 2009. We plan to have our Spring Summer 2009 plans finalised by end of August 2008, so in July and August my attention will be on making sure those plans are finalised, and all covers, typesetting, marketing materials, website details and so on are completed. Prospective authors, get your submissions in now! Also in this time will be the final preparations for Christmas - the sales and marketing for this has already started and will be finalised by mid July. Christmas books will be sent to the printer in early August and review copies sent out late August. During this period I'll be working 100% from home in't countryside, so no London meetings. No meetings of any kind, in fact: I have yet to have a single meeting in the last five years that I couldn't have managed over the phone or email, so whilst it's nice to put a face to a name, I'm going to enjoy the fact that I can squeeze a bit more efficiency out of my day by not having meetings and lunches. Yes, I know: networking, personal contact, blah - I've done enough in the last five years to tide me over for a few months, I reckon. 

From 1st September, I imagine I'll be rolling around like a big walrus, hardly able to breathe or stand, so will be working at a minimum. I'll keep on top of emails, paperwork and so on, but all major projects will be finalised and it'll be more a question of keeping things ticking over. 

From whenever the baby's born (meant to be 2nd October) for three months, I'll be working at a minimum - keeping on top of emails and finances only. Let's assume it's October, November, December. We don't publish any books in November and December, so it's quite good timing, really. 

From January 2009 onwards, I'll be back working part time (which, don't mean to be funny, but frankly is many other people's full time) as I'll have childcare (in the home). From then on, assume it's business as usual and if I'm struggling, I'll tell you. 

Whilst I'm working at a minimum, as usual Anna will be managing incoming submissions, and if there are any problems Rob will be covering for me. Indeed, I am spending the next few months compiling a Big Yellow Folder for him. It's so named because once, when I was at B&Q, I took a week's holiday (gasp!) Before I went, I typed up all the processes, instructions, updates, background to supplier issues, EVERYTHING that people could possibly need in my fleeting absence, indexed them and bound them in a yellow folder, and left a large A4 note on it, printed out, which said 'Everything You Need Is In Here'. I left it propped up against my screen. Of course, on my return I had 3500 emails, irate post-it notes all over my screen and desk, and 60-odd voicemails all clamouring for stuff that was ... yep, in the folder, which had remained unopened. 

That's not going to happen this time! For one, Rob isn't an arse - excellent starting point. For two, I am going to use this blog to catalogue Snowbooks' major processes. My word, it'll be dull for some of you - so just don't read the posts. But I always find it interesting to read about how other companies work, so maybe some people will find it interesting. 

So hopefully that gives you a bit of an insight into my plans. Bottom line: if you have an exciting new project you want to talk about with me - talk about it now!","","","","2008-03-19","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

That rumply thing is a close-up of a rare Snowbooks bag (homemade of course, probably by Anna). It's wrinkly like that because I got it out of a drawer. I fetched it out because I'd cornered one of the <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/03/meece.html"">plump country mice</a> who sneak into my kitchen. I even got it into the bag. And then I made a fatal mistake and peered into the bag to check my prize. And it leapt out and zoomed away. Curses. So let that be a lesson to you all. In fact I bet there's some wise incomprehensible country saying about 'See ye not the bag'd mouse twitchin', lest it flee thither to yon kitchen'. Anyway, when I finally catch those meeces I'll try to get a picture of them, for anyone who doesn't find fuzzy rodents phobic (if I can do so without terrifying them too much).","<hr/>

I spent a pleasant fifteen minutes chasing one around my living room this morning. I'd got it caught in a box, but my desire for a picture of it was yet again my undoing, and it whizzed off behind my TV. I put on great, big, soft fleecy gloves and tried to grab it but it eventually gave me the slip.

I refuse to be intellectually outclassed by these mice - but I don't want to hurt them either - so for the time being, the battle of wits continues.","","","","2008-03-19","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

<a href=""http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/columnists/article3585775.ece"">This story </a>in The Times caught my eye, because it's about Bertelsmann, the ten billion dollar media company that owns Random House amongst others and publishes Dan Brown. Turns out they're not doing too well, but that's an aside. It doesn't matter that they're only generating a 0.4% pa growth rate, because they're not listed on any stock market. They're an independent, privately owned company, run by the Mohn family. Their share price isn't going to crash as a result, thus devaluing the company (although they do have a hefty $6bn of debt, which is rather eye watering.)

So why isn't Random House a member of the IPG? Really, sometimes I think that the 'independent' tag is a misnomer. Other companies who do term themselves 'independent' have little in common with what I think of as indie publishers - Faber, for instance. And indeed, some companies who I think of as independent aren't, actually, since they're floated on one or another stock market. 'Small' is a much more useful term. I think I'll use that in future. 

Not that any of this matters, of course. Just interesting.","","","","","2008-03-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

And it will download new books over the ether while you're out and about. All we know are these two things. 1) This is Amazon. They put a lot of effort into this so they must have been expecting significant demand. 2) They massively under-estimated demand and sold out after 5.5 hours. They have not been able to get back in stock since. Ever unit that comes in goes on clearing their order backlog.

So however many units have been sold, it's a lot more than Amazon were expecting. And if you look at the magnitude of the launch, they clearly expected to sell a lot. I'm just saying, is all.","","","","","2008-03-21","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

You non-Brit types may not know this, but in this country the weather gods have a perverse sense of humour. Contrast and compare, say, with where Anna lives, in Minneapolis. In the winter snow piles up by the ton and the temperature might be below zero (Fahrenheit) for a couple of months. When the thaw comes, there are a few moments of Spring and then the temperature and the humidity both climb vertically until a Summer of roasting, sweltering mugginess sets in. The air is so hot and close that the mosquitoes grow to an impressive size and an apocalyptic lightning storm is never far away.","In the UK, the deal is this: mild weather in the South for at least 300 days of the year, with the North occasionally experiencing actual meteorology instead of a sort of pleasant compromise between precipitation and aridity that passes for a climate. But in exchange for months of restraint, the weather gods like to blow off a little steam when public holidays roll around. Usually, any three-day weekend is a wash-out. And with weather taking a turn for the dramatic in recent years, not only is the perennial restraint dwindling, the bank holiday outbursts are becoming positively theatrical. Yesterday I sat watching the bright blue sky of Summer alternate with snow, hail, rain and some sort of compact, frozen water that looked like polystyrene packing beads. We cycled from Summer to Winter at least a dozen times. As holiday weekends go, I think you just have to laugh in disbelief.

<hr/>

Incidentally, having said all that about the Minneapolis weather, that's where I'm going to take my first holiday for a couple of years. Hopefully in early May the twin forces of Roasting and Freezing will be evenly balanced, with neither able to dominate. (Also, apologies to those affected, but I will be willing the dollar to completely tank by then, while the pound remains miraculously sturdy.)","","","","2008-03-23","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

As a trainee storyteller, I spend quite a bit of time looking at other people's yarn-spinning to see what works and what doesn't. When I see good work I wonder how the writer came up with it. When I see bad work I ask myself what makes it bad. Of course since no two people can agree on a definition of what 'worked', the answers to these questions are somewhat elusive. But for whatever reason, with visual storytelling, it seems a little easier to make progress in my post-mortems.","My favourite objects for study are near misses: stories with most of the right ingredients but which somehow never rise, or gel or take off (pick your metaphor). 

Though many in the world of publishing may not approve of this fact, Terry Pratchett is an immensely, stupendously successful author. Many may feel that it's not what people <em>should</em> be reading, but nevertheless it's what a lot of readers want. Personally, I'm on the fence. I've read probably a dozen of his books. I've laughed out loud many times, and a couple of the books had me steadily chuckling throughout. I've got more out of a good Terry Pratchett book than I ever have out of a Booker prize winner (which of course says a lot about me). But TP writes them at such a rate that inevitably I've felt like many of them are just by-the-numbers exercises which made no impression on me.

What's been really fascinating, with my recent TV and film obsession, has been picking apart the TV adaptations of two Terry Pratchett books, both adapted for the little screen by Sky Television. There was last year's Christmas Special, <em>The Hogfather</em> and this Easter's <em>The Colour of Magic</em>.  This year's attempt is noticeably better than last year's, but they're both lifeless and flat too much of the time. You find your mind wandering. And even if you've read the books you can't always work out what's going on. 

But why does that matter? Why do I regard my confusion with the story as a bad thing, when in other circumstances I'd think of it as a delightful mystery? The first time I saw <em>Dark City</em>, for instance, I had no idea what was happening or why, but I adored every second of it. I enjoyed working out what was going on.

I also chafe at the way the Sky adaptations give us few clues as to what most of the characters want out of life; we can't follow them on their quest because everything they do seems spur of the moment or reactive (or just confusingly random). But is understanding motives really fundamental? Again, stories with clouded motives which leave you continually guessing can make for gripping drama. 

There's also the matter of some appalling blocking and editing. The camera is never looking where you want it to or it's loitering too far from the action. It never finds any interesting emotions on the actor's faces and reaction shots tell you nothing. The camera lingers on incidentals or sits stuck in a wide shot in a way that makes you wonder if the operator is chatting on his mobile. There's also a literalness to it all, where if someone falls down (which happens a great deal), we have to watch them get slowly back up again and then mutter something about having fallen down. There's no sense of urgency or pace. In fact I began to suspect that for their three hours of television they shot exactly three hours of footage and put the whole thing on the screen. But then again, perverse cinematography isn't always the kiss of death. <em>Cloverfield</em> is both a triumph and a disaster as a piece of entertainment, but the way in which it won't let you get a good look at the monster has you scrutinising the frame, looking for glimpses. It's genius. By making you work to orient yourself it draws you in and simultaneously makes it all seem more real.

Another <em>Colour of Magic</em> failing is the mushy sound. I suspect most of the program has been ADRed, because there's often a general sense of muttering and chattering that doesn't tie particularly well into what's happening on screen. In fact I often get the sense that an extra bit of dialogue has been shoehorned in using a shot where you can't see the actor's mouth. But then some fantastic scenes in other productions end up needing to have their dialogue dubbed in again afterwards. And changing lines of dialogue in post-production can sometimes be inspired.

I could go on like this, finding problems with the adaptation and then thinking of counterexamples where the fault isn't really a fault. For instance, there's no attempt to have one empathise with a central character, but good stories may lack a simple centre. The acting is generally pretty poor, but in almost every case, these bad performances are being coaxed from good actors. David Jason is terrible in the <em>Colour of Magic</em>, giving the impression that not having a heart attack from over-exertion is his main concern, but give him the right script and he can do marvellous things with it (even in straight drama).

So while I instinctively know that these TP adaptations are bad, every concrete criticism I can level at them is some other film's quirky charm. I'd like to understand which are the crucial failings and which are merely annoyances. It's too easy to rationalise one's disappointment. For an example of this, read any shoddy film critic's panning of a bad movie: they see no further than the actors, who are often nearly powerless in these situations.

Perhaps it's as simple as a blanket lack of competence that encroaches into every image and envelops each scene. Perhaps mysterious motivations, perverse camera-work, undirected actors and a plot that's difficult to follow are forgivable only when you can convince yourself they're deliberate choices. This, after all, is not <em>intended</em> to be avant-garde; it's supposed to be 'family fun', whatever that is.

So as you can see, I haven't really got any conclusions (besides replacing the director, Vadim Jean, who is also the writer, with someone who is, you know, more good). But specific lessons aren't necessarily the point. Looking at the use and misuse of all these variations on classic storytelling, and seeing where stylistic choices or professional blind spots cross over into liabilities, is valuable even when it's not definitive. It's all about learning to pilot a story from take-off to landing - and watching Sky slam their expensive vehicles into the sides of mountains is every bit as educational as witnessing more commercial and professional ventures come in for a neat landing.","","","","2008-03-24","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

My MacBook is the first Mac I've ever owned. I like it very much. Although every now and then it stops responding, or responds very very slowly, because it's doing something more important. My Windows machines do this too, and at least in their case I'm better equipped to figure out why they're ignoring me. For instance, with my Windows laptop, every time I wake it up, I have to fight a duel with Symantec's anti-virus speed-bump software - a duel which I always lose. I want to browse a web page, the anti-virus software wants to check for online updates - and it's always me who has to wait. This means there's little point in my laptop waking up in 30 seconds, because it might well be a couple more minutes before I'm allowed to do anything.","Which is why I'm planning to build a very special computer. It's going to be fast and have Windows XP on it (Vista is nothing but a cunning Microsoft trick. One which I don't intend to fall for). I'm going to keep it away from the Internet, so it's not doing to have any anti-virus software on it - so that should double its speed. Neither will it have all the dozens of programs which love to while away their time fetching themselves updates and indexing their data and getting ready in case you decide later you might want to use them. It will run only whatever I've explicitly decided to run. And given that every component of this machine will be ten times faster than the PC I owned in 1995, I hope that by employing these drastic measures, it will actually be slightly quicker in use. I'll let you know how that goes.

<hr/>

Symantec are particularly appalling when it comes to slowing down machines because they do all sorts of other numskulled or borderline crooked things too. For instance, they make software that won't uninstall correctly, so you're stuck with it. And when your subscription is up, you are taken to a website to renew that subscription, but unless you pay very close attention and read the small print, what you actually end up doing is buying a whole new suite of software (this catches my dad out every single time). And the Symantec software on my laptop keeps interrupting me to pop up a little dialogue telling me that there's a new version of its software I can download for free. The only way Symantec would give something away for free is if there's something seriously wrong with its current software and it's covering its behind, so I've tried to do as it says. But when you click on the link it offers, the next thing you see is a Symantec web-page telling you that you typed the URL wrong. Smooth.","","","","2008-03-25","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

Whilst I want to get rid of the cute little mice who sneak into my kitchen, I don't want to kill them. I surprised one today in the cupboard under my sink. It was inside a box, which it jumped out of when it saw me. It had hauled out one of the delicious morsels I keep in that box and chewed open the wrapping. I hope for its sake it hadn't eaten much. They're Calgon tablets and they get rid of limescale in your washing-machine.

Now it's cooling its many heels in a big plastic container, with a few unsalted nuts and raisins for fodder, and its Calgon box for shelter. I think I just need to provide it with a refreshing drink and it should be set until Em comes over this afternoon and we can take it on a walk with us and release it on the other side of the hill.

I thought it was in the box when I threw a towel over the top of it, but it had already leapt into the air and was caught in the towel. Which means when I pulled the towel tight I was compressing the mouse, which made a sort of 'Eeek, Eeek' noise. I quickly stopped squeezing it and I don't think I did it any harm. It seems able to get around fine and is still inquisitive and everything so hopefully I only I only caused it some discomfort rather than actually hurting it.

I have had the dubious pleasure of working for a number of awful bosses, and alongside a number of awful people, in my various roles throughout the years. Although they made my life miserable, I really do have to thank them. For it's when I've got too much to do, five or six urgent deadlines all pressing on me, and I start to feel a little bit hopeless, that I just have to think of those people, and a sort of steely resolve comes over me. I would hate to be anything like them, to the extent that if I feel myself start to whinge or feel sorry for myself, I just have to think ""No! Mustn't be like X! Mustn't complain, or be self-obsessed, or be pathetic. Mustn't blame other people, or lash out, or feel sorry for myself."" And without fail it puts me right back on track. I can handle anything except the thought that I might be like them. 

So - deadlines! Workload! Pah! I scoff at you! You are nothing to me! I am invincible! etc. And a huge set of thank yous to those people who I've asked to help me out today at such short notice - you know who you are and you've saved my skin.","","","","","2008-03-26","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"
"41557","","1","U.S. Economic Problems","Publish","true","","Dear Brainy People in Television, I would like you to make a program which explains the following: 1) The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_steagall"">Glass-Steagall Act</a> and its gutting in recent years 2) The operation of the Shadow Banking sector 3) US Deficit Spending and the expansion of consumer credit 4) US/Chinese balance of trade and reciprocal investment.

Pretty dry stuff I'm sure all that sounds. But one of the weird types of investment that's had the markets in a flap lately are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap"">CDSs</a> (Credit Default Swaps). As best as I can understand, they're bets that someone will go bust. You can use them as insurance or you can just speculate with them. There are around $43 Trillion worth of CDSs out there. (Yes, that's Trillion with a 'T'.) That's far too much debt for any government to step in and take care of and the next company who finds themselves in a similar predicament to Bear Stearns could end up triggering waves of defaults in that market.

The Shadow Banking sector is also of interest because the last time there was a giant banking meltdown in the States, following the stock market crash of 1929, the Glass & Steagall Acts were put in place to make sure banks couldn't overextend themselves so dangerously. Glass-Steagall endured until the Nineties when rules were reinterpreted and banks were indirectly permitted to create quasi-autonomous offshoot companies that did lots of things that banks do, but didn't fall under normal banking regulations. I believe that's how such vast sums of money came to be lent to sub-prime borrowers without regulators having a say. 

And I've talked in the past about how China does so much manufacturing for the U.S. that the only way they can keep their exchange rates favourable is to invest a sizable chunk of their revenues back into the States at generously low interest rates, thus inadvertently helping to inflate various investment bubbles. 

I admit it all sounds rather arcane, but I wouldn't mind knowing a bit more about how the finance markets came to be hanging by their fingertips from a cliff-top with various pension funds, mortgages and share portfolios dangling by a thread beneath them. Unless we're very lucky, we might all end up knowing a lot more about CDSs, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation"">CDOs</a> and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard"">moral hazard</a> of bank bailouts, courtesy of the evening news.

<hr/>

Also, something I find a bit weird about this meltdown: when I check Google News for the U.S., there's rarely any mention about the economy tanking. When I checked yesterday, the only economic story was under Business (it didn't make it to the top 40 biggest general stories) and it was trumpeting the news that mortgage re-financing was up, as though that was the indicator that deserved the focus. Isn't it strange that the UK newspapers are hyperventilating about the U.S. economy, but from what I can tell, the U.S. media aren't making much of the fact yet? (Or perhaps Google News is just broken.)","","","","2008-03-26","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Skip over this if you're a) bored of mouse talk or b) afraid of mice. But read on, dear blog-friend, if you want to see what kind of fierce mammal Em and I let loose on the county yesterday. The mouseless thumbnail to the left is the hastily constructed mouse nest that Em fashioned so that Calgon, the Murine Marauder, would have something to scamper under.","He/She had spent the day in a big plastic box with water, nuts, raisins and his Calgon container for shelter. He kicked most of the Calgon sachets out of the box and quickly gnawed two holes in the back of the box. From what we could tell later, he used the chewed-up card to make a bed in there and dragged a couple of almonds in to nibble on between naps.

When Em came over for Movie Night (tonight's screening was <em>I Am Legend</em>) and we were ready to go for our walk, I taped up the Calgon box and carried it up and over the hill. Then Em put a little clump of straw on the ground, which she stole from some nearby ponies, and took up the camera, while I took care of the mouse wrangling (because Em didn't want to get any mouse germs on her, being in a delicate condition).

I've had to boost the gamma (as we say in the biz) inside the box so's you can see its occupant. The second shot is just a close-up of that.

And that was that. He scampered off under cover of the straw and, so far as we could tell, didn't trot behind us all the way home.

I'm quite sure, though, from looking at the picture of the <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/03/meece.html"">two fridge mice</a> I posted originally, that this is a different mouse (in fact it looks like a completely different make of mouse).

I've been meaning for a while to register this mini-moan somewhere online. It is ultra dull, though, and relates to part of the ONIX message, so you'd best not click below. Move along, move along. These aren't the droids you're looking for.","I am astonished at the number of times you have to state availability in the ONIX standard. I'm someone who obsesses about the number of keystrokes I have to make to do a task - the fewer the better. At B&Q, for instance, I know that it took 138 keystrokes to register a new title on SAP (their badly-implemented although world-class ERP solution) (god, acronyms, ERP means Enterprise Resource Planning. Er, which means Big Database of Everything), because I counted them, and moaned, and moaned. So I have a history of wanting to do things in the quickest way possible - especially if they're very boring things like maintaining a product database.

Yes, again I secretly entered a prize without telling Rob. You'll recall he finds it astonishing that I can be so busy with the normal, day to day running of the business and yet still wilfully load myself up with extra work which he sees no benefit to - other than a nice pat on the head. But, you see, the thing is, I *like* pats on the head. 

He says it would be OK if, for every trade prize I enter, I also enter a competition for something useful, like a washing machine or to have the mortgage paid for a year. Or a hamper. So soon my front yard may be cluttered up with all manner of white goods and wicker. 

Anyway, the photo is my entry for the Independent Publisher of the Year nibbie 2008 (the same one we won in 2006). I did it as a website, but also printed out the pages for the judges and put the website on discs for them. And I made my own <a href=""http://www.papercdcase.com/about.php"">paper CD cases</a>. Pretty, no?

I know some people didn't understand why using character and paragraph styles is a good thing when I banged on about them, but I am living the proof of it at the moment. I am doing some work for a client who has sent me a word doc that needs designing, in InDesign, before outputting to PDF. Sure enough, there's nary a character or paragraph style in sight. So rather than it taking me five minutes, it's taken me an hour for each word doc - and there are five of them - to manually identify and stylise the bolds, italics, headings and so on. So I will be charging them triple, and wasting lots of time. Shame. 

I might start to insist on entry standards for readers of the SnowBlog. You're not allowed to read this blog unless you use styles. Hmm, tricky to enforce...maybe I'll create a written test. You have been warned.","<hr/>

<em>Rob's update</em>:
This is semi-superfluous because Em has covered much of this before, but I thought I'd just quickly spell out again what this 'styles' business is all about it. Styles get used in Microsoft Word, not to mention in InDesign - as well as all over the web (in XHTML/CSS). The idea of styles is to separate decisions about colours and fonts and layout from decisions about sentences and words and meaning. It's a good idea to keep them separate for all sorts of reasons. In big organisations, it's good because you can hand each decision to the appropriate expert: that way designers don't have to write articles and copywriters don't have to choose colour-schemes. And even if you work solo, it's handy to be able to restyle a gigantic  document (like a novel) just as easily as you would a single page.

The trick is to make decisions about the look of a document in a two-step process. The first step is to label the different parts of a document: e.g. chapter headings, running headings, body text, lists. Then, separately, you say what each one of those things should look like (i.e. font size, bold, indented, etc;) - and you store that information in a 'style'. That way, if you want to change all your headings to blue, you don't have to page through and find each heading and apply a new colour; you just make one change to the 'heading style', and throughout the document all the paragraphs the heading style has been applied to automatically turn blue (which will be all the headings, unless someone screwed up). 

That's why it would take Em so much longer to rejig a document that didn't have all its chapter headings labelled as chapter headings, and so on. Instead of simply updating five or six styles, Em would have to go through the whole document, a paragraph at a time, looking for anything that needed changing.

Of course, someone still has to label the chapter headings and the lists and so on, so why should it matter if it's Em today or the original author last week? Well, it's very easy to label a document as you go. Microsoft Word even provides simple shortcut keys to tag all your headings as headings while you're typing. So assuming you want a heading to look like a heading as you create it, you can either change the format so that it has big, bold letters (and cause lots of work for everyone down the line) or apply one of the built-in heading styles, which will also make the heading big and bold, while simultaneously labelling it as a heading. Since it's very nearly as easy to label as you go, as it is to manually format as you go, there's little excuse for avoiding styles, and thus little excuse for causing Em extra work.

And there are cool bonuses to using this approach. For instance, if you label all your headings properly, Microsoft Word can create you a table of contents automatically. It knows what's a heading and what's not, so it can make a list of each heading with the page number it appears on and lay it all out nicely for you - which is all a table of contents is. Seeing a table of contents magically appear for a thousand page book with fifty chapters and five hundred sub-headings is pretty cool and takes no extra effort if you use styles as you write.","","","","2008-03-27","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

Now I'm hardly a big expert on photography, but because we're publishers we do a lot with images. And there are one or two simple things I've picked up that are useful enough that it might be worth me passing them along. This is a tip about how to take photographs with fuzzy backgrounds. Now why would you want to do that? The answer is that it looks good. Movies do it the whole time. The actors' faces are in focus but the background isn't. The result: you look at the actors and think the background looks arty. Or think of it like this: your first decision is which direction to point the camera in. Your second decision is what to focus it on. And that second decision is taken away from you if <i>everything</i> is in focus.","So there's a tiny bit of theory to this, but I'll try to make it painless. 

There are four bits to a camera. 1) The lens, like the lens in your eye, focuses the light. 2) The aperture, like your iris or your eyelids, cuts down the light by covering part of the lens. 
<img alt=""aperture.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/aperture.jpg"" />
3) Then there's a shutter. It can open for a short time to let a little light in or longer to let more in (in the olden days, they just used to take the lens cap off for a moment.)
 
4) And lastly there's the film or sensor (I'm assuming most people use digital cameras these days) which captures the light. 

Even though understanding lenses is tricky, most of us understand the idea that you fiddle with the lens until the thing you're photographing looks sharp. But how do we control whether the background is in focus too? 

The answer is to use the aperture. It not only cuts out light; it has an effect on focus. If you close up the aperture so that only the centre of the lens is uncovered like this:
<img alt=""apertureclosed.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/apertureclosed.jpg"" width=""104"" height=""79"" />
that not only cuts down the light coming into the camera, it also makes all the light go through the middle part of the lens which is the bit best able to focus lots of different things at once. 

If you open the aperture out so that the lens is hardly covered at all, like this:
<img alt=""apertureopen.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/apertureopen.jpg"" width=""130"" height=""98"" />
then not only do you let more light in, but light will go through the outer part of the lens as well as the centre. The result is that whatever you focus on still looks sharp, but everything else in the shot will be fuzzier.

Here's an example of what that looks like (<a href=""http://www.photoaxe.com/examples-for-understanding-depth-of-field/"">stolen from this site</a>). Here's a shot with the aperture closed up. This is referred to as a wide 'depth of field' (i.e. lots of the shot is in focus):
 <img alt=""f16example.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/f16example.jpg"" width=""480"" height=""331"" />
And here's a shot of the same scene with the aperture opened up. This is a narrow 'depth of field' (i.e. only a few things are in focus):
<img alt=""f1p4example.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/f1p4example.jpg"" width=""480"" height=""331"" />
Now, maybe you like the first shot better, in which case set your camera to automatic and it's probably what you'll get. But if you want pictures more like the second, you need to make sure your camera has its aperture open as wide as possible.

Telling an automatic camera what aperture you want usually involves finding a little dial like the one in the picture and setting it to 'A' for 'aperture priority'.
<img alt=""controlwheel.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/controlwheel.jpg"" width=""104"" height=""92"" />
In 'aperture priority' mode, you choose the aperture and your camera tries to make sure there's enough light for your shot by adjusting how long the shutter stays open for. Look in your camera's manual to see how you set the aperture, but you want to make the setting a very small number. You could think of this number as controlling how much of the scene is in focus: if it's a low number, only a few things will be in focus, if it's a large number, then more of the scene will be in focus. Dial the number down as low as you can go and still take a photo. 

(To repeat: a small number for aperture means small depth of field because the aperture is open, large number means large depth of field because the aperture is closed. What's slightly confusing is that the number goes down the more you open up the aperture, but just think of that number as activating the aperture, increasing how much it's used and hopefully it makes sense then that you increase the number to close the aperture. And you turn the number way down to effectively turn off the aperture as though it wasn't even there.)

The final point to mention is that since arty, shallow-depth-of-field photos involve having the aperture wide open, there's a lot of light streaming into the camera. The camera cuts this down, if it's too much, by snapping the shutter more quickly, but on a bright day there might still be too much light. That's where filters come in. You put a polaroid filter (made from the same stuff as polaroid sunglasses) on the camera and now you can open the aperture up even in bright sunshine. And with any luck, there'll be some of that on the way soon.","","","","2008-03-29","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Oh <a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/"">they</a> are so cool. Let me name the ways:","- They publish in a clear niche (progamming and IT)
- Their books are technically outstanding
- They have a website with a decent search engine

So far, so normal. But here's why they blow my socks off:

- You can buy bound paper editions of their books in a shop
- You can buy a bound paper edition from their website
- If you don't want to buy the whole printed book, or if it's 3am and you've been stuck on some arcane progamming problem since the morning before, and realise that their book might have the answer and so for your sanity and sleep you need it NOW, not two days later when it's shipped, then you can search for relevant keywords via <a href=""http://safari.oreilly.com/"">Safari</a>, the online library. 
- Safari will bring up a <a href=""http://safari.oreilly.com/0201674874/ch09lev1sec5#snippet"">snippet</a> - the paragraph or page that features your search terms. If, once you've read your searched-for material in context, you think more info would be useful and this is the book for you, you can keep searching within the book for free, or read the whole book, online, right then, by adding it to your Safari bookshelf. A subscription to Safari only costs $19.99 and you can have 6 books on your bookshelf - and swap them out, like a lending library. If, once you've read it online, you want a printed version, you can buy it for a discount. (If you think about it, it's so much more useful to have programming books online - you can copy sample code easily rather than having to type it in.)

And that's not all. 

- Since O'Reilly are so technically proficient, you trust them. So when they release a 99 page<a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596513993/""> Shortcut pdf </a>document on your subject of interest for $9.99, chances are you'll buy it and be grateful it exists. From their point of view, it's an easy way to make money: they have used their already competent authors to come up with some extra content. They don't have to spend money on printing a book, or pay to bind or ship it. Their brand means that they just have to pop it on their website, which is easily searchable, and the right audience will find it. 

- Oh yeah, and they run best in class <a href=""http://en.oreilly.com/webexsf2008/public/content/home"">seminars</a>. 

A company that has dominated a niche, done it well and sells its wares innovatively - and has found a way to make money by first giving content away. I wanna be them.","","","","2008-03-29","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

Rob will be pleased with me. Last year I was shortlisted for the UK's <a href=""http://www.publishingnews.co.uk/pn/pno-news-display.asp?K=e2008032712151449&TAG=&CID=&PGE=&sg9t=4f56f68bc99afd8ce4a83ae8e099a881"">Young Publisher of the Year </a>nibbie, which was great, until it got to the evening of the award when my small brain finally started to think about what would happen if I won it. See, not only did you get a shiny nib trophy, but you also had the 'opportunity' to go to India for 6 weeks to learn about the Indian publishing industry. Great - unless you happen to be one of a tiny team running a company for whom the idea of being away from the business for more than an afternoon would require serious thought.","As it turns out, I didn't win, so I didn't have to make a painful choice about whether or not to go. And this year the organisers seem to have taken that on board. They have reduced the amount of time away (this year in Argentina) from 6 to 2 weeks. This would still give me pause for thought, though, plus I have to say I hate travelling anyway (be a consultant for a few years if you want the gloss of travel well and truly dulled).  

So this year I didn't enter, because I think other people would find the experience so much more rewarding than I would if I happened to win. In fact, let me be blunt - the travelling aspect would be a right pain in the whatsit to me, requiring juggling of time and money and probably not directly helping my business, whereas others will find it thrilling and useful. 

As it turns out, by having a baby I'm going to have to do far more juggling and arranging of things than even a 6 month trip to India would require, so I suppose it can be done if it has to be done. But the point of this post is this: I think that the organisers should consider whether, in structuring the award this way, they are biasing it in favour of people who work for large companies. Large companies are geared up to cope with absences. If an owner-manager wins, they will have to make a sacrifice to take up the prize. As well as the time away problem, during the period of the travel the organisers do not pay the winner a salary. Fine if you're in a large company - but where does the money come from in a one-man-band? 

Perhaps I'm wrong, but I don't feel that the organisers have really got inside the heads of owner managers to come up with a prize that would be really useful and valuable to them, and therefore they bias the prize towards those in large companies. And that's why I didn't enter.","","","","2008-03-29","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","5"

I have a love/hate relationship with marketing. I love the ju-jitsu effortlessness of good marketing. The way exactly the right combination of words and images can connect powerfully with people. But I hate the way marketing departments wreck otherwise good products. How so? Well, no matter how good a product is, marketing departments see it as their job to raise expectations even higher. They wouldn't feel like they'd played their part if customers weren't expecting more than they got. Which is why all of us are skeptical about marketing. Which is why marketeers have to make explosively mind-shattering claims in order to attract our jaded attention. A particularly short-sighted twist on this phenomenon occurred during the launch of Windows Vista. The ensuing court case is dragging lots of sordid details into the light.","Have a <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080330-the-vista-capable-fiasco-to-hell-with-system-recs.html"">look here</a> for more detail, but the gist is that new operating systems are a great opportunity to sell new hardware. You can only run the shiny new versions of things if you upgrade. All very mundane and despicable - as far as it goes - but why not take it a step further? Why not use a new operating system as a way to get people to upgrade to... old hardware? That's to say, stick a badge on a sluggish mid-range machine saying that it's 'Vista Ready' then people will buy it in order to have the run the new version of Windows with the glittery visual effects (and not much else besides). No one seemed to think this through and realise that persuading people to buy underpowered hardware would make Vista seem like a dog. Which it did. And then people realised that 'Vista Ready' was a con and the whole thing ended up in court. When you think of the effort and the billions of dollars that went into making something that just seemed like a slower version of Windows XP, with some prettier visuals - and then the effort that went in to persuading people to buy a machine that would be brought to a standstill by those same visuals - it's all a giant exercise in value destruction. Not to mention another nail in the coffin of honest marketing. What's next? Machines with 'Intel Inside' stickers that don't have Intel Inside?

Anyway, I'm glad there's a court case going on, because my dad - who normally checks his computer buying decisions with me - bought one of those machines and wanted me to fix it so that it didn't take twenty minutes to start up. I've tried a couple of things - like turning off all of Vista's pretty visuals and tripling the memory installed. But I'm expecting eventually that I'll need my secret weapon: a copy of Windows 2000 for it to run instead. Then it will really start to fly.","","","","2008-03-31","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

It's highly unlikely that anyone except me will find this useful. But I have to admit that sometimes I use this blog to make a note just for myself to refer back to later. Evil, I know. Anyway, if you want to know some arcane function in Excel, click on.","This: 

=IF(ISERROR(VLOOKUP(F42,Sheet1!B:F,5,FALSE)),""-"",VLOOKUP(F42,Sheet1!B:F,5,FALSE))

is very handy. A normal IF function looks like this: 

=IF(VLOOKUP(F54,Sheet1!B:F,5,FALSE),VLOOKUP(F54,Sheet1!B:F,5,FALSE),""-"")

That means:

IF the Vlookup function is true, return the result of the Vlookup, otherwise return a dash in the cell. 

It looks more complicated than it is - it's simply saying if(this logical test is),(true, return this value),(false, return this value).

However, if the test returns an #N/A, you have to manually delete the cell, because it won't sum if it's in a range of cells that needs to be summed. And in a scale out, which is what I mainly use Vlookups for nowadays, that takes about a minute. A minute that I could be profitably using looking out of the window, or petting the cats. So naturally it must be eliminated. 

So by inserting an ISERROR function as in

=IF(<strong>ISERROR</strong>(VLOOKUP(F42,Sheet1!B:F,5,FALSE)<strong>)</strong>,""-"",VLOOKUP(F42,Sheet1!B:F,5,FALSE))

You can get rid of the #N/As automatically. Magic! 

Oh, no-one's reading this. Em of the future, when you search for this post next time you do a scale out: just remember that the ISERROR function will get rid of those annoying #N/As.","","","","2008-04-02","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

Would you believe it - a whole literary festival on our doorstep, in Oxford, and I completely missed it. I only heard about it as a result of the coverage of an Oxford Literary Festival event - a panel talk debating the validity of lit bloggers vs critics. Either I'm not paying attention properly, or they need to up their marketing next year.","A quick aside before I comment on the blogger vs critic debate - and an aside that is typically self-absorbed. Thinking about this made me think about the nature of the Snowblog. It most definitely is not a lit blog. We rarely review books, unless they're political. It borders on a PR alert service for Snowbooks, which is bad, really, because I'm sure readers don't tune in for that sort of thing. Thanks for putting up with it, anyway. It borders on a political commentary blog, courtesy of Rob's interests. It contains frivolous diary-like entries (cf: lambs, below). It contains a lot of geekery. It contains a lot of opinion on industry goings-on. All in all, I'd say it was the diary of a business, a real-time reflection of what it's like to run a small publisher and our reflections on the things that make us run the company as we do. 

All of that navel gazing is simply to say: we're not a lit blog, so I comment on lit blogs vs critics from an outsider position.  

I am not a huge fan of newspaper literary critics - mainly, I have to say, because they very rarely review our books. Since I don't know any of them personally, I don't have any reason to feel particularly warmly towards them as a result. And even when we get reviews, they don't affect sales in the slightest. Snowbooks has never been the sort of publisher that does things just because that's the way it's done, and it's plainly stupid to spend vast amounts of time and sums of money on postage and writing individual letters to reviewers a) who never review the books b) whose reviews have no commercial benefit. The only reason we ever solicit reviews in the papers is to make the author feel better, which is a pretty feeble one, even though from the off we always say to authors 'we focus on retailer promotions, not reviews"".  

Bloggers, on the other hand, are of more interest. Firstly, their reviews are from the heart. They are to be trusted because there's no paycheck or career consideration in it for them. And readers get that. Secondly, they are pretty much to a person thoroughly charming - by which I mean they email to say thank you, they usually review a book if we've emailed in advance and they've requested it, and their reviews sell books. I cite as an example the launch of The Needle in the Blood last year, which many bloggers were kind enough to comment on. We could tell that it affected sales because of the numerous comments after the reviews: 'DGR, you've persuaded me to buy it!' - that manner of thing. 

There's a middle type of reviewer, though - the specialist press. They are lovely, thoughtful, interested - like the bloggers, I reckon, because they care so deeply about the sorts of books they're reviewing.

So that's my point of view. Read about the coverage of what the bloggers and critics thought via the links <a href=""http://www.readysteadybook.com/Blog.aspx?permalink=20080401160052"">here</a>.","","","","2008-04-03","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

Boy oh boy, can I recommend <a href=""http://www.247printhouse.com"">these chaps. </a> We're using them this season to print our catalogues and posters for LBF. They're cheap (around 369 for 1000 8 page A5 catalogues, which is very reasonable indeed), and you know how tight fisted I am, so big first tick. They do free delivery. Their website works, beautifully, and has all the info you need to know on it. When I emailed with a query about delivery times, they got back to me straight away. All in all, they appear to be a business who have clearly thought through what they're trying to do, for whom, and are working flat out to make it a success. I intend to help them along with that. You should consider using them, too! I'll post photos of the catalogues and poster once it's delivered (next Thursday, just in time for the London Book Fair! There's my final reason for thinking they're smashing: they've dug me out of a hole as many printers require 10 day lead times.)

On their website, under the 'Other' section, is a tantalising array of stuff that can be printed on, including T shirts, baseball caps and lollipops. I can tell things might get out of hand here...","","","","","2008-04-03","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

My confusion over the fate of the Friday Project is finally abating. An <a href=""http://www.publishingnews.co.uk/pn/pno-news-display.asp?K=e2008040311150631&TAG=&CID=&PGE=&sg9t=0873f480090fccb4b9f4ff5ab3064fb5"">article in Publishing News</a> gives some illuminating details. Up until this week, I've been a bit frustrated that despite all of the available information pointing towards a liquidation, there were also occasional references to the 'sale of the company'. A phrase like that carries connotations of continuity and survival, and I felt it ran the risk of raising false hopes among creditors (though I understand that those at TFP weren't free to set the record straight). In my mind I was sure the Friday Project was about to disappear for good taking its debts with it. But it seems I was half right and half wrong.

The PN article explains that Harper Collins has acquired enough of the old company to be able to create an imprint of the same name. This clone of the old Friday Project will operate out of the same offices, with most of the same staff, and will retain some of its former list, but from the point of view of paying its bills, it's a different firm. It will start with a clean slate. Which is to say, unless I've misunderstood, we won't be able to ask the new Friday Project to pay the old Friday Project's bills. A line will be drawn under those liabilities. No wonder it took Harper Collins a while to put a deal like that together. I'm pleased for the TFP staff who'll have secure jobs and will once again know where next month's rent is coming from. On the other hand, it will take a bit of getting used to: the idea that the firm's spirit lives on, but not its former obligations.","<hr/>

The other point in that PN article that jumps out at me is the opinion of Antony Cheetham that TFP was under-capitalised. His view seems to be that if they had only had more money to put into advances and marketing they could have broken through into serious profitability. Now he's the expert, and I'm not, but I have to say I've got a very different take on things. 

We spend very little on outside marketing because we're too afraid we'll never make that money back. Ditto with advances. 

I suppose it's just that Em and I are wimps when it comes to gambling large sums of money - and maybe we'll never have a big win unless we learn to bet big too - but that's just how we see the world. Given that TFP used up perhaps ten times as much capital as we've ever had access to, it's just difficult for us skinflint types to accept that TFP's big problem was that they weren't able to spend more.","","","","2008-04-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

I've spruced up the website this morning, so thought I'd share some of the highlights. 

There's a new, interactive* (ooooh) <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/snowbooks08webcat.pdf"">catalogue </a>on the <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/snowshop.html"">Catalogue page</a>. On the same page you'll find our <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/rights.pdf"">rights guide</a>. All the new author pages have been updated, so now you can read about George Mann and <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9781905005888.html"">The Affinity Bridge</a> in glorious technicolor. We're always adding new stuff to author pages: don't forget about <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Emson.html"">Thomas Emson's</a> two free short stories on his page and <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Bower.html"">Sarah Bower's</a> handwitten manuscript, audio reading, photos and edits that were cut from Needle in the Blood. 

I also fixed some bugs, and smartened up the catalogue pages with some amazing new XSL that Rob wrote. It makes my brain itch to think about how clever he is. 

Do let me know if you find any bugs on your travels! Oh yes, and sorry to keep going on about this, but all the updates, including manually fixing bugs, took me 20 minutes because it's all automated using XSL. Do <a href=""mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"">get in touch</a> to ask how you can make the most of your ONIX data. 

* meaning that if you click on the images, you go straight to the title's page. It was funny - there was an IT man at the IPG conference this year making out that his catalogue solution - which cost 1000 on special offer - was cutting edge, because it had links (and a fancy page-turny bit of javascript which is hardly worth a grand). We've done it using a hyperlinked PDF which is, er, free.","","","","","2008-04-04","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Just in case it's of passing interest, here are the big jobs on my plate at the moment.","First up, it's royalty season. Next week I'll be calculating the royalty statements and sending them out - I hope before LBF. LBF is the following week. It is possible I won't finish them on time, in which case I'll let you know, but that's the plan. Royalty payments are then due within the following three months. 

Next big project: sales kits for the US. Since their email never got to me, I didn't know they were due (I was told I should have looked at their website but hello? Do I look like I have time to scour websites on the off chance there's something I need to do?) Anyway, now they're late, so I have to do them. It's not a quick process: I have to create and print 50 packs including covers, marketing highlights, AIs, first chapters, sample spreads - and then post them to 50 different locations. For a girl who likes automation and efficiency, you can imagine my feelings. 

Third big project: end of year reporting pack. You may think this can be deprioritised, but as <a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/03/managing-urgenc.html"">The Lord My Godin </a>says, you have to make the long term planning stuff as important as the daily emergencies. That is what I'm trying to do, not that it's easy. 

Finally, I have a huge typesetting job to do in Mike Burrow's Bicycle Design - at least 50 hours work, I've figured. It better bloody sell. It's already two weeks late for the printer. Gah. 

Add to all that the daily 60 emails (of worth), the two manuscripts I have to read, the two websites I want to do, and I'd better hope that my awesome time management capabilities are in peak condition! Seriously, it should be fine, but I wouldn't mind one jot if they decided to cancel LBF this year. What are the chances?","","","","2008-04-04","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

As you probably know, hardline Christians have been developing their own brand of science. In America, there are now <a href=""http://www.dinosauradventureland.com/aboutDAL.php"">theme parks</a> and <a href=""http://www.creationmuseum.org/"">museums</a> where you can see tableaus depicting the days when all dinosaurs were vegetarians and lived happily alongside humanity, even pulling ploughs for early farmers. A creationist preacher is <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/apr/05/evolution.controversiesinscience"">currently bringing this message</a> to Britain. To say that it's difficult for me to understand how anyone can swallow this is to put it midly.","I've worked in a lab where fifty times a day we made calculations or performed experiments which could only work if evolution functioned almost exactly the way it says in textbooks. Not only can you see in the fossil record how creatures altered and adapted over time, but with the state of molecular genetics being what it is, you can pretty much watch evolution happen. You can compare the DNA of different, related critters and see how their genes gradually diverged from their common ancestor. You can track bacteria and viruses evolving in real time. And intellectually one can understand why natural selection works the way it does. 

And it's not three guys in a room somewhere working on this. Tens of thousands of researchers spend their days digging into every aspect of how DNA alters over the generations: how, why and with what results. Adaptation through Natural Selection (i.e. the 'Theory of Evolution') is as complete a theory as humans have about anything. And it seems to me that the only way to not believe in it, is to be ignorant of what it says and the mountain of evidence that supports it. It would be akin to repairing engines for a living but not 'believing' in internal combustion.

But I was chatting to a friend the other day who runs a genetics department, and I asked him whether he thought it was possible for someone to work in genetics and yet somehow not to be persuaded by its arguments and he said 'yes'. He had known someone whose doctoral thesis involved charting the way a particular DNA sequence had changed over time by analysing the differences between the version humans have and the versions our nearest ape relatives have. This person worked out how this one sequence of DNA had diverged in different species over the last few million years, and yet outside of work they still claimed to believe that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that God had created all species as they now are rather than permitting them to arise and alter and go extinct over time. 

I just hope that Britain's culture of insolent skepticism will help us here and we won't soon find ourselves arguing over whether Creation Science should be taught in our schools or whether our biology textbooks should include front-cover disclaimers stating that their conclusions are disputed. If people are going to believe in a creator, can we at least agree that she went to a vast amount of effort to build a universe that runs on science and it's disrespectful to turn our backs on it or interfere with other people's attempts to understand its wonderful complexity?","","","","2008-04-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

For various reasons, I wrote myself a Doctor Who script a while back. Not knowing where the TV series was going, I wasn't sure which companion to use, so I set it at some interval where the current Doctor is off on his own. I imagined it being this year's Christmas Special. Having watched last night's Torchwood season finale, and having noted one important similarity with my script, I think there's a major plot point that would now look as though I'd just lifted it from off the telly. If anyone's going to read my script, they might as well do so while it's obvious that I didn't copy an idea from Torchwood.

Em enjoyed it and said that because she had to picture it as she read, afterwards she felt like she'd actually seen it on TV rather than read it on paper. With that in mind, I thought I'd post it here in case anyone fancies 'watching' a free Doctor Who Christmas Special. It's a Word document (let me know if you want a PDF instead). <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Rob%27s%20Doctor%20Who%20Xmas%202008.doc"">Click to download</a> and enjoy. (And don't forget to tune into the real thing tonight.) If you're not familiar with standard script abbreviations, click 'Continue reading' for a v. quick list.","<hr/>

Script Notes: 
For info, there are a number of abbreviations in the script. POV means Point Of View, as in the camera is showing you what someone is seeing. VO means voiceover. OS means offscreen, used when you can hear someone talking but not seeing them.

<hr/> 

Sadly, I only enjoyed six seconds of this evening's Doctor Who. I imagine, if you've watched it, and you know my views on companions, you can guess which six seconds they were.

<hr/>

Also I want to throw out a very slight caveat: Cap'n Jack is in my script. He says clich&eacute;d things. Not because I couldn't think of original-ish dialogue; it just seems to me to be how he speaks.","","","","2008-04-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

<p>Might I recommend to you all <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Cut-Down-a-Tree/"">some instructions</a> I read today in an old issue of <a href=""http://www.makezine.com/"">MAKE magazine</a> about how to cut down a tree. I'm not planning to cut one down, but if I ever did, now that I've read these instructions I think the chances of me dying will have been roughly halved. That's down from starting odds of about 100% (though it's probably best to ignore the article's first bit of advice).</p>

<p>Click on the picture above for the whole thing, but here's the jolly way in which it starts::</p>","<span style=""font-family: courier; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;""><p>Warning! Get really drunk first. Then it won't hurt so much when you chainsaw your face off and crush your family.</p>

<p>First step - find a tree to cut down. No problem. As soon as you know how to cut down a tree people will sense it and constantly ask you to cut down trees for them.
It will help if you know some of the technical vocabulary:</p>

<p>Equipment: Every piece of equipment used in this process is called a ""Widowmaker"".</p>
<p>Tree Anatomy: The tree and every part of the tree is called a ""Widowmaker"".</p>
<p>Terrain Analysis: Everything in the vicinity of the tree is called a ""Widowmaker"".</p></span>","","","","2008-04-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

A couple of belated reviews of weekend events. First the weather. There was thick snow. It was superb. My reaction to it was so joyous and wide-eyed it really does make me think that I need to go and live in Canada. Plus who wouldn't want to live in Canada?

Secondly, Doctor Who. <a href=""http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/tv/2008/04/to_paraphrase_the_doctor_when.html"">This Guardian reviewer</a> says it all. Running, shouting, sonic screwdrivers, rowing relatives. Unless the only criteria for success was 'must sound exciting when heard from the next room' I would have to rate it as a clanging gong, an empty vessel. (Psst. RTD, read my script. See how it's better than yours? Commission me. (Hmmm, that's probably not the way to get a job)).","","","","","2008-04-08","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

Publishers need to be designers as well as readers, don't they? Or maybe that's just me trying to relate this post to the world of books. Anyway, as you know, I've been thinking about movies a lot lately. I've been trying not to just watch them but actually to analyse them. You might also remember <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/03/post_15.html#more"">I was playing around</a> with the look of an old TV series that I got off DVD. One of the most useful (and funny) people to read on the subject of moviemaking is Stu Maschwitz and I've recently guzzled down <a href=""http://prolost.blogspot.com/"">his blog</a> and all its archives. One of his posts is about the way all big blockbusters have their colours very heavily worked over and tweaked in 'post-production' (meaning after the movie has been shot). And he discusses one of the current favourite looks: highlights warmed into the orange, shadows pushed into the blue and skintones miraculously preserved despite everything else being a weird colour. Look at these shots from <em>Die Hard 4.0</em> for instance:","<img alt=""DieHard.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/DieHard.jpg"" width=""460"" height=""306"" />
<img alt=""WillisCloseup2.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/WillisCloseup2.jpg"" width=""280"" height=""186"" />
Could you have a pink face in a world where the light was blue? Only in movieland.

I mention this because the first time I went on a Photoshop course and the instructor showed us how to brighten teeth and the whites of eyes he also told us to look out for it on billboards and magazine covers on our way home. And sure enough everywhere I looked there were ridiculous radioactively radiant smiles and glowing eyes. I'd just never noticed before.

And now, having read Stu Maschwitz, I suddenly notice that the colours in modern movies are impossible.  <a href=""http://prolost.blogspot.com/2008/03/save-our-skins.html"">This post</a> of his is about the blue-skintone-orange/shadow-midtone-highlight thing. And <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/DV-Rebels-Guide-All-digital-Approach/dp/0321413644/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207651587&sr=8-1"">his book</a> talks about the '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_bypass"">bleach bypass</a>' look of <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> that's so extreme, and yet it rapidly stops looking weird and just seems evocative and captivating. 
<img alt=""PrivateRyan.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/PrivateRyan.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""285"" />
So next time you see a 'big' movie, set aside a couple of seconds to figure out what's been done to the colours you're looking at.

Stu also has wonderfully profound things to say about range. Camera manufacturers work hard to make sure that their devices keep more things in focus in more colours and in better resolution every year. And then filmmakers spend their time making sure that what they shoot is grainy, with a limited palette with only what relates to the story in focus.

Look at how beautiful this shot from <em>Michael Clayton</em> is (and I don't just mean George Clooney). 
<img alt=""MichaelClayton.jpeg"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/MichaelClayton.jpeg"" width=""500"" height=""213"" />
It's got limited depth of field (see <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/03/photography_tip.html"">my post on that</a>) and a limited colour palette, and half the frame is empty. It's gorgeous. (And it was our Movie Night movie last week. I rate it 'Two thumbs up! Fine holiday fun!'.)","","","","2008-04-08","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

Hmm. The world had better start to prove to me that it isn't full of baddies soon, or I am going to have to accept that it is - and that's not healthy. I have been diddled, and have yet more evidence to suggest that if you want a job doing properly, do it yourself.","I have been checking the Barclaycard bank rec this afternoon, for one reason and another. I have done a manual rec, but I wanted to do one with a proper trial balance as part of my Get The Company Ready For When I Inevitably Am Hospitalised In A Coma For Three Months After Childbirth preparations (let's hope it won't happen - but I'm making sure that absolutely all paperwork, filing and accounts are easy to understand and filed properly in case Rob has to take over in an emergency). And I was puzzled to see that August 2006 was looking a bit odd. Did I really spend 753.68 on Computer Software? I was struggling to remember what it could have been. So I dug around some more - and it turns out that my then bookkeeper (a bookkeeper who I lost because she had a mental breakdown - not a good sign) has entered *one* transaction of 753.68 into Sage for *all* the Barclaycard transactions in that month. And rather than being open about her laziness (fraud? since she charged me several hundred pounds for this piece of work) and putting in under Adjustments, she's put it under Computer Software. 

So that's bloody marvellous. I only asked her to do a bank rec for a couple of months when I was really busy - and look where it's got me. Inaccurate - annoyingly inaccurate - accounts with incorrect cost coding. 

So I say again - if you want a job doing properly, do it yourself. How am I ever going to learn to delegate if people keep acting like this?","","","","2008-04-08","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

I said it a while back: I'm passionately ambivalent about marketing. When it's good, it's brilliant. But when it's <em>too</em> good, it's manipulative and creepy. But I can't help thinking that a little magic marketing dust in the right place and the world would be thinking very differently about its upcoming climate catastrophe. 'Global Warming' was an awful, awful term to use. Unless you already lived somewhere too hot, you just thought, ""Great! No more chilly mornings. My SUV will be easier to start."" I've always used the phrase 'climate change' instead, but then I feel I need to tack on a qualifier and call it 'manmade climate change' because otherwise the term is equally useful to skeptics who think natural climate cycles are responsible for any changes. Now even ignoring the problems I have with the term 'manmade' (which never sounds very feminist to me) it's still a clunky phrase. What I would have preferred is that back in the late Seventies when I first saw a TV program about some crrraaazzzy Californian hippy scientists who thought that spraycan propellants could mess with the atmosphere, is if the term 'climate damage' had been coined.","And then, thereafter, we could have argued about whether 'climate damage' was real and how much of it had occurred. It's a simple phrase that conveys something bad we're doing and ought to stop. And if we'd got into the habit of using it, we wouldn't have to have those longwinded explanations when the floodwaters rise in Gloucestershire of how 'Global warming can actually involve changes in rainfall patterns as well as an overall trend of rising temperatures, blah, blah, blah'. I do draw the line at calling skeptics 'climate change deniers' with its attempt to lump them in with those who say the Holocaust never happened, but I think I'd be ethically comfortable with a less loaded but still rather pointed term like 'climate damage'. Is it too late to put it out there and let it galvanise the world into saving itself?","","","","2008-04-09","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

(following on from <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/03/movie_night_mouse_release.html"">here</a>) I'm sorry, mouse fans, that I don't have a picture of my latest mouseploits. At about midnight last night there were one or or two crashes from my kitchen. I was asleep but they woke me up and I thought 'stupid mice' and was tempted to go back to sleep, but on the other hand, they were quite loud crashes which made me wonder if it was really a tiny, silent mouse instead of perhaps an angry badger in my kitchen instead. Or perhaps the mice had toppled the fridge over in order to get at its tasty contents. So I trudged upstairs (my kitchen is upstairs) and turned on the light. No sign of meece. But then I heard a rustle, pulled open a kitchen drawer and there, THERE, was a mouse sitting up holding a pecan nut in its paws paused in mid-bite looking guilty. Suffice it to say some fairly humane Keystone-cops-style chasing ensued with me cornering the mouse on a couple of occasions and then it outsmarting me. Eventually, once I got too tired to properly enjoy this sort of thing, I gave up and went back to bed, but first I had another go at positioning the humane trap I bought. But in the morning it had been moved out of the way and was empty. I am going to have to marshal my ingenuity and find a way to show these mice who's boss (assuming they don't already know). (Also, I never found out what the crashes were. That's a fun surprise for another day.)","","","","","2008-04-10","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

There's one photo to see and one photo we wish we'd taken but didn't. Never ever leave the house without a camera plus assortment of lenses, that's the lesson here. As Em and I went for our pre-Movie Night wander we saw a stoat. Or maybe it was a weasel. It was dragging a dead mouse behind it into its burrow. Then, after it disappeared inside we waited. And it popped its head out and stared at us for about five seconds before dipping back down. So we waited. And it did it again. We got it to pop up and stare at us four times before it had had enough of waiting for us to push off. And each time it popped up we said 'hello' to it. Which I think annoyed it even more as it had a dead mouse to be getting on with and clearly didn't have time for our nonsense. The photo I managed to capture was of the humongous rainbow a little later on, once we were safe indoors. See all the birds sitting there, right by it, enjoying the colours?","","","","","2008-04-10","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Rob's in Big London this afternoon learning to kill a man in a tranquil fashion at his Qi Gong lesson, so I can post a sneaky post whilst he's not looking. I am turning the SnowBlog into a dating website for the afternoon! What's the point in having a blog if you can't use it to find your best friend a partner?

Available: one very clever, funny, thoughtful, nice, friendly, entertaining, funny, super, articulate, handsome, educated, well-read, kind, lovely man. Solvent, with own publishing company and countryside home near Oxfordshire. 

Would like to meet: A nice, clever, sparkly, funny girl. Should be interested in the world and be a non-religious left-winger. Should say charmingly unpredictable things. Should be entertaining and thoughtful and kind. Should like cats, not dogs (except the nice kind of dogs). Should have youthful outlook. Should not be jaded, cynical old bag. Should not drink like a fish, ideally. Should like the countryside. Location and age not important: brain important. 

Why: Because Rob is about the superest person I know (except for my Andy, but you can't have him, he's mine) and it's ridiculous that he's single. 

So get in touch! Leave your comments below or email Rob at snowbooks dot com to introduce yourself in a witty, charming manner. Tell all your (nice, single) friends too. He is a proper catch so be quick!","","","","","2008-04-10","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","14"

While it's very kind of Em to do some pimping on my behalf, it's clear to me that what chicks really dig is someone who has a good grasp of how abstruse programming languages can be combined with core business data to devise novel time-saving workflows. With that in mind, ladies, let's talk about XSL.","First off though, if you're hazy about what XML is, I've written what I think is a very painless introduction to it that doesn't assume you know how to program or hack into Skynet or anything. It's a PDF file and <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/A%20simple%20guide%20to%20XML%20for%20publishers.pdf"">it's here.
</a>
So this is what XSL looks like (at least the way I write it.)
<img alt=""XSLsnippet.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/XSLsnippet.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""268"" />
Hmm. Actually, I shouldn't have included that screen grab because now everyone will have stopped reading. So just try to forget you saw it. I just wanted to make the point that XSL is one of the strangest programming languages I've come across. It's designed to turn one kind of document into another. And unless you get clever about it, the input document will need to be formatted as XML and chances are the output document might be too. Why would you want to reformat one XML document into another? Well, here are three kinds of XML document:
<ul>
<li>Onix message (the industry standard way of telling someone about a book)</li>
<li>Web page (providided you write in the variant of HTML known as XHTML)</li>
<li>InDesign page (you have to create the layout yourself, but all the words can come in via XML)</li>
</ul>

You need to have the first kind. You might want to automatically generate the second and third kind. You need Onix messages to send out to people because that's what the industry increasingly runs on. But once you've produced those messages, they contain all the information needed to create a web page about each title or to take a blank catalogue layout and fill it with words about your books. And since what you're doing there is to turn one sort of XML document into two other kinds, it stands to reason you'd want to use a weird language like XSL.

We go a little bit further, actually, and regroup our data before creating things like web pages. So, we have an XSL 'program' which looks through the Onix messages for all of our titles and makes a list of all the author names it finds. Then it works back the other way, creating a web page for each author and adding to it information about each of their titles.

We also sneak in a bit of extra data to our Onix message in order to say what genre each title is in. The Onix standard already contains that sort of data in the form of BIC codes but, not to phrase it too technically, they suck. Or rather they tend not to group books in ways we find useful. And the titles of their groupings are too ugly to use without renaming them. And there's two different versions out there which creates quite a mess. So since we'd have to do some work to turn BIC codes into useful classifications, we took the easy way out and added our own codes (the Onix standard leaves space for that sort of thing, thank goodness).

Now, granted, writing all that code* takes a while. But it only needs doing once. Thereafter, turning Onix messages into other useful things like web pages takes moments and is automatic, as Em has described and demonstrated in some of her recent video tutorials. And that's the essence of satisfying IT: a bit of serious head-scratching and deep thought for a few days, but the pay-off is to save weeks of time later, and remove the repetitive drudgery from tasks like website and catalogue updates.

I'll post a bit more about this in the coming weeks; this is just a reminder of what we use this XML/XSL stuff for and why it might be useful to you even if you don't yet grasp the details.

Part II is <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/04/data_tricks_ii.html"">here</a>.


* 'code' means programs or software. But I can't quite bring myself to use those terms even though they're clearer. People who write code don't tend to say things like 'I did some programming the other day'. They 'write code'. They especially don't say 'I wrote a computer software application the other day'. Terms like that only occur on the BBC or in the Daily Mail.","","","","2008-04-11","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","7"

I don't want to bore everyone with a lot of theory, so let me put the conclusion bit first. Sometimes people just need a loan to get their lives off the ground. I'm not really talking about Westerners. I'm talking about people who, if they could afford to buy a few tools could set up a mechanics garage or if they could afford a sewing machine could make and repair clothes. I just came across Kiva.com which makes small loans for just that sort of thing. It seems like a pretty cool way to put some cash to work. Plus you can look through all the projects and decide whether you want to help someone grow flowers in Senegal or open a general store in Ghana. <a href=""http://www.kiva.org/app.php"">Take a look</a>.","Now on to the boring bit. Capital is the basis of capitalism and without it you're stuck. You need those start-up funds so you can get going so you can get some income coming in so that, among other things, you can pay back your start-up money. A few years ago I read a fascinating book by Hernando de Soto called <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mystery-Capital-Hernando-Soto/dp/0552999237/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207988808&sr=8-1"">The Mystery of Capital</a> and it was basically an exploration of why capitalism, that supposed miracle of economic transformation, didn't seem to work in the third world. Were brown-skinned people lazy perhaps or too corrupt? Or perhaps they're all stupid. The book's conclusions were both surprising (because it's an answer no one seemed to have thought of) and dull: most third-world countries lacked property infrastructure. That's to say it was often difficult to prove that you owned a particular house or piece of land. Which was a problem because land and houses are the main source of collateral for loans. These countries also tended to lack the legal infrastructure for administering contracts and resolving disputes. So, the borrower couldn't secure their loan against their house and the lender couldn't get their money back if things went wrong. Which is really a roundabout way of saying that there was little capitalism because there was little capital. But the book also looked at what happened when capital was available and, you will not be surprised to learn, that even people in hot, dusty countries can work hard, be ingenious and honour their obligations. 

That's why the idea of microfinance (which just means making small loans to poor people) is such a great one. If you're not a big fan of capitalism but you want to help poor people, this is a great way to do that. But if you are a big fan of capitalism, then your own beliefs tell you that the best place to lend money is to the people who need it the most because they are both the most motivated to put it to work as well as being in a situation that's so capital-starved that there's almost no competition.

In a way, it's the exact opposite of the credit crunch that's poisoning the big money markets right now. After the dot-com crash in 2000, there was a glut of investment money with nowhere to go. Stocks seemed like a bad bet, so investors tried investing in markets that already had all the money they could handle. They invested in property and lent to homeowners. But because neither of those sectors were short of cash, they caused a property bubble by bidding up the price of houses on the one hand and created masses of precarious debt by putting mortgages into the hands of people who couldn't pay them on the other. Whereas, if that glut of cheap cash had been poured into under-invested areas - i.e. had been used as microfinance in developing countries - there's every likelihood they would have caused a boom in the world economy rather than risking a crash.

So that's the theory over with. I'm going to figure out what I could afford to loan a hazelnut seller in Azerbaijan. Or maybe it should be a start-up beauty salon in Togo. The thought that the money I spend on my weekly shop at the supermarket could set up a business is just a little bit mind-boggling. And more than a bit tempting too.","","","","2008-04-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

So it's the London book fair tomorrow, through to Wednesday. The thought of talking non-stop for three days is a bit exhausting, but I always get into the swing of things when I get there.

Yes, more fun facts about XSL and why you might want to learn more about it, if you're a publisher. Last time, I said XSL was weird. It's weird in a few ways. Firstly, if you've done your homework and read <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/A%20simple%20guide%20to%20XML%20for%20publishers.pdf"">this document</a> you'll know what I mean when I say that an XSL program, or 'transform' as they're called, is also a valid XML document. That means it's got lots of open and close tags and attributes, so at first glance it looks more like the code behind a web page than a program.","<img alt=""XSLexample2.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/XSLexample2.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""150"" />
I also said that XSL transforms (XSLTs) reformat one document into another one - and that often both the input and the output are XML files. XSL does that in an unusual sort of way. The transform is divided up into sections, called 'templates', and each template is capable of handling a certain kind of XML element. The template in the example snippet above handles <span style=""font-family: courier; color: blue;"">&lt;ONIXMesssage&gt;</span> elements. You can see that, if you look in the <span style=""font-family: courier;"">match</span> attribute right at the top. We might have another one that's capable of handling just a single <span style=""font-family: courier; color: blue;"">&lt;Product&gt;</span> (in Onix a <span style=""font-family: courier; color: blue;"">&lt;Product&gt;</span> is a title) and a third might handle only the publication date.

You run the XSL program by 'applying' templates to it. The XSL processor reads in the XML input document that you're planning to transform and starts at the top, trying to find a template that can handle whatever the top level element in the file is. If you've thoughtfully written such a template, it will get executed. Presumably, because your plan here is to create some sort of output document, your template will contain instructions to manipulate the input values and then to write some sort of information to the output file. But at any point, as your template works its way through the input document, it can hand a piece of the work to another template - like when I said you might write a template that specifically handles publication dates. Whenever a <span style=""font-family: courier; color: blue;"">&lt;PublicationDate&gt;</span> element is encountered, you can tell the XSL processor to look for a template to handle it. It works like a subroutine in a BASIC program, in that when you call another template, the program makes a note of where it's got to, goes off and runs that other template, and then comes back and continues from where it left off.

I mentioned that templates will typically want to process bits of the input document and then produce a bit of output. In our case, what we're often doing is taking information from an Onix message and combining it with XHTML tags so as to create a web page. So the Onix input message might contribute the name of a book, but our XSL program wraps that name in XHTML tags so that when a web browser displays our output document that name will be formatted as a heading.

That's probably enough for this instalment. Next time I might give some example bits of XSL code and show how it does its work and what it produces at the end.

Sorry we've been a bit quiet. It's surprisingly difficult to string a sentence together after a long day of meeting people, added to a hefty commute. As you may know, Em and I have a long-running argument where I claim that only about six people read this blog and she claims that people are always, ALWAYS, coming up to her and saying they're fans. Or at least regular visitors. I have to say, the evidence is mounting for Em's claims. I've had at least half a dozen people come up and say something along those lines. It's been excellent. And of course strangely unsettling at the same time, because when you meet someone for the first time you don't necessarily expect that they'll know your political views, domestic rodent problems, relationship status and TV viewing habits before you've even learned their name. 

Tomorrow Em is having slightly fewer meetings (only about a million, I believe) so we might spend more time looking around and seeing things and gossiping. And then, once we've caught our breaths, we can get back to our main job. Which is of course writing blog posts.","","","","","2008-04-15","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

But I'll worry about that another day. I've also been keeping even sealed-up packets of things out of the way of potential rodent marauders. All they've got is empty cupboards smelling slightly of disinfectant if they follow their usual routes. Which I suppose is why they've ventured downstairs and into the bathroom.

Click on that thumbnail to see what they were up to last night. Surely that can't be good for them, can it? I mean at least it's that Simple soap without additives and stuff. But still. You're not supposed to eat it I think. Plus, if I spy a mouse and it's foaming at the mouth, how worried should I be?","<hr/>

After I'd taken a photo of that soap, I left it on my desk. When I got up at about 3:20 this morning to investigate what sounded like mice banging wooden spoons on cupboard doors, I noticed that they'd been up on my desk peeling more of the wrapping off the soap and feasting on its sudsy goodness. As I mention in my comment below, they really are trying to provoke a response at the moment.","","","","2008-04-16","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","11"

Doesn't it feel like Monday? Even though LBF was tiring enough, I feel like I've had a bit of a break. Effectively, therefore, this is going to be a two day week. Hooray!","LBF was fun and we had a great time. I didn't attend any of the seminars (things like that often annoy me, anyway, as they usually consist of the industry either trying to frighten itself into action on something like digitisation, resulting in no action at all regardless of how apposite the message, or placate itself by saying everything's ok. Plus I had important sitting down at our stand to do whenever I had a spare minute). Instead, I had a goodly number of meetings and enough time to have some lovely chance meetings with friends and peers old and new. Tom from Legend Press kept Rob and I entertained throughout (he really is a funny man) even though he was robbed of the UKIPY award (Tom, you won in our hearts) and it was lovely to have Mark Thwaite (clever *and* cute, a dangerous combination), Michael R, George M, George W, John B, Philip W, Suzanne A, Vanessa R, Steve S, the lovely folk from Jarrolds, and plenty of others swing by the stand.

As well as passers by, I had 30-odd meetings with retailers, suppliers, scouts, sales reps from Asia, South Africa, the US, and Australia, agents (yes! agents! and they didn't scratch my eyes out), and other publishers from other countries. Only two of these were disappointing, so that's not bad. 

It's not fair to say on here which books were the stars of the show, but suffice to say there was lots of interest for all our various areas, from historical fiction to fantasy, general fiction to cycling. My next job is to chase up all the people who requested review copies and to see what people thought of the copies they took away with them. 

Oh yeah, and Matt from BCS brought in his 11 week old baby and I held it (I don't think I've ever held a baby before) and it didn't cry. I call that a good omen. And it had excellent socks and was nice. 

All in all - a great three days, happily spent and now I'm strangely rejuvenated!","","","","2008-04-17","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

Now, when I talk about authors, remember I is one. Actually, before I say any more, that kind of talk makes me want to digress for a moment. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923736/"">Joss Whedon</a> is getting ready to film his new show and said of his script and his excellent cast: <span style=""font-family: courier; color: blue;"">All in all, pound for pound, soup to nuts, man vs beast, it's a pretty amazing ensemble. I'm not sure how I landed this troupe, but rest assured I'm gonna write bestest good word for talkacting to them yes! They're in good hands.</span> But that's besides the point. I was just going to say two things about authors.","Firstly, it's scary when they try to press their manuscripts on you at the London Book Fair. This was new information to me. I did talk to a couple of really nice authors, but I also met a couple who appeared determined to make me publish their work by using a combination of intense staring, standing too close, and speaking in a menacing I-could-snap-at-any-moment monotone. Again, let me repeat, I have sympathy for authors because I have sympathy for me. But how is this tactic ever going to work? Yes, I'm afraid of you now, and no, I don't want to sign a contract with you so that we come into regular contact. Is it just a function of how important the pitching of their novel is to an author, that the pressure of the moment would turn their body language into that of a Mafia enforcer? Or have some people just had enough of being given the run-around and the fob-off and have decided they're going to get a straight answer out of someone even if it's just a call for security?

Secondly, I thought I would reiterate an author-centric point (assuming I haven't offended everyone and they've stopped reading). I bought a copy of one of my favourite books about six months back and gave it to Anna, who reads the lion's share of our submissions. She read two pages and said, ""It's just not my thing."" I also gave a copy of another of my favourite books to Em a few years back and she couldn't manage to fight the boredom enough to finish it. In fact she dropped it in the bath, I suspect partly because her grip on the book loosened slightly after its prose lulled her to sleep. And we three really are on the same wavelength in so many other ways. We laugh at the same weird, ridiculous things. We end up using the same expressions. We usually agree on which Doctor Who episodes are good and which aren't. And yet Anna and Em would have turned down two of my all-time top ten books. It seems crazy, but I just don't think there's any getting away from it. I think submissions work like that. It's something to think about if you happen to have had your manuscript rejected recently. By anyone.","","","","2008-04-18","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","8"

A certain retailer whose shops are on station concourses has just returned 5000 worth of stock - that they bought last June. And guess what - that's perfectly allowed. Under the terms of the Industry Returns Initiative, retailers are allowed to return anything they buy, for full credit, between three months and 18 months after purchase. 

My view is the the Industry Returns Initiative was more a way of making it easier for retailers to return stock, rather than the much more useful approach of trying to reduce returns. It's typical of an initiative in this industry: name me any industry level project in the last ten years that we can be proud of. Go on, try. 

Aside from the brutal commercial implications, think of the trees and the print factory emissions and the diesel and the congestion and the packaging and the labour. One day the Daily Mail or the Independent will do an expose on the shocking waste in the book trade and there will be a public outcry. Maybe then the most culpable retailers might just have a bash at actually forecasting their stock requirements like all other multiple retail sectors have been doing properly since the 80s. 


---------------------

Update, after a morning's fuming: Oh yeah, and the other thing about returning stock after so long is that I've already paid royalties on those sales. Obviously we have a reserve against returns, but these particular returns account for more than the reserve allows for. And with paperback fiction, the sales profile is usually top heavy - the majority of sales occur in the first three months of the book, and it's quite common for sales to be virtually zero (maybe 5-20 units a week) a year after publication. So I'm never going to recoup that money. Sorry, authors, it sounds mean of me, but it is a serious consideration. Technically, at the moment, our authors are more than 10,000 in the red because of this phenomenon - money it's very unlikely will be earned back by future sales. And all this in a publisher that doesn't pay advances - imagine what it's like for publishers who do. 

Also, I dropped my phone and I think it's broken. And Rob gave it to me, and he will be sad that I can't look after my nice gifts properly. 

At least it's raining, which I like, so I can snuggle with the laptop on the sofa without Nice Weather Guilt.","","","","","2008-04-19","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

I'm sure <a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/"">Seth Godin</a> blogs about this the whole time, but there's a sort of Uncertainty Principle at work in certain industries. The more completely you try to control customers the greater the possibility that instead of tightening your grip on them you'll actually cause them to ping off out of your reach for good. (Actually, forget the Uncertainty Principle metaphor. Since when was describing something familiar in terms of quantum mechanics ever a good idea.)

I'm just reading a book about <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004555/"">Walter Murch</a>, Oscar-winning film editor, and his decision to edit to edit <em>Cold Mountain</em>, not on a top-end professional Avid editing deck, but on a Mac using software you can buy in PC World. Why would he do such a thing? Well, the background is that Avid, the company, charged a lot for their products, were in no rush to bring out refinements or new technology, they didn't provide very good technical support and they were very inflexible in how they let you use their equipment, often blaming any faults on non-Avid gear if you were foolish enough to use any (one anecdote from the book mentions them blaming problems on the use of an NEC monitor). Famous names in the film industry would try to talk to them about innovations they'd like to see, but Avid weren't really interested.","I bet for a while Avid thought they were really doing well. Not only were they the only game in town, with the high-end editing market sewn up, but they were really getting some mileage out of their monopoly position. So much so that cinema legends were prepared to use a home computer rather than their products because at least it was easy and reliable and flexible and you could fix it yourself. 

I wonder when was the last time Avid sold one of their editing consoles. I wonder if they even make them any more. I wonder if they ever wish they'd done things differently and built a position of trust instead of control. Probably not.","","","","2008-04-19","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

I wouldn't be at all surprised if the uppermost thought in your mind these days is this: what does Rob think about the most recent couple of episodes of Doctor Who? And you wouldn't be the only one. I've been wondering too. And the tentative good news for the Who production team is that I don't think I'm displeased. Though I'm not delighted either. [spoilers ahead - though no words of great wisdom]","The Pompeii episode was a big improvement on the flimsy, hectic, vacuous cute-fat-creatures one, but still not very solid to my mind. Thousands suffocate screaming; they can't be saved. That sounds like fun. And who knew you could survive falling out of the sky if you were in an escape capsule made of rock? Or that volcanic eruptions can cause rifts which ripple back in time to make all fake soothsayers become real soothsayers who can then see forward in time. It all seemed rather complex and random, and more than a bit depressing. Though I liked the Welsh jokes.

And I wouldn't say there's much actual atmosphere or rapport yet - which makes it a bit difficult to feel carried along. I imagine it's because the Doctor and Donna are rather an odd couple who couldn't really plausibly have gelled yet, though they force the odd mad grin in each other's direction. Which just brings home to me what amazing chemistry Billie Piper used to achieve when she was around. Pure gold. Plus, you cared what happened to her character. Donna is still too new (and residually annoying), whereas with Martha I was more concerned for the actress than the character. (She seemed so nice; how would she react when she realised how many people thought she was terrible? It didn't seem fair. Though I shouldn't have worried about her career; she seems to be back next week. I do my best not to watch the previews, but I don't have a good feeling about Martha's return. I just hope she doesn't keep doing that confused frown and looking frightened to be on TV.)

But I am pleased and amused by what they've done to the character of Donna. Suddenly she's the sort of woman who rarely screeches, thinks deeply, concerns herself with the wellbeing of others and is reasonably knowledgeable on matters such as Roman history. The three defining points of her character originally were belligerence, ignorance and self-absorption. The accent and the actress remain, but nothing else of the old Donna survives, I'm pleased to say. I can probably live with this Donna (though showing me glimpses of Rose doesn't help). But it is sad to see how interesting and eloquent Catherine Tate can be when she's not acting. Couldn't she be loud and a little cartoony in real life, but sensitive and charming on film? Isn't that the more usual way with actresses?

One thing that's bugging me, though, is the mystery of the disappearing bees. It's been mentioned twice, so clearly they're going somewhere with it. But what confuses me is that in real life there is a problem with bees too. They're mysteriously dying in large numbers. And since they pollinate most Western food crops, if they go extinct we're in deep trouble. Whatever Doctor Who 'reveals' at the end of this season is not, I can say with some confidence, going to be the real secret of their waning numbers. So how is that going to work? That would be like having the Doctor fix our climate problems. Except that when the show is over, they're still here. So I'm expecting some confusing lameness on the bee front.","","","","2008-04-19","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

Following on from a post about <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/04/control.html"">Control</a>, the desire for which seemed to be a fatal weakness of the Avid company, I want to continue the story. Recap: when Anthony Minghella made the movie <em>Cold Mountain</em>, his legendary editor, Walter Murch, decided to use a thousand-dollar copy of Apple's Final Cut Pro software instead of a hundred-thousand dollar editing console. It was unheard of. This was a major release for a major studio. The film starred Nicole Kidman, Jude Law and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger. It was Oscar material from the first, eventually winning one and attracting six nominations. If you were Apple, how would you feel about that? You'd rather cheekily called your semi-pro software 'Pro' and now some of the ultimate pros wanted to use it.","You can guess the answer. You'd do very little.

Walter Murch only asked for one favour from Apple. He wanted a pre-release copy of a little plug-in that would help him tie the movie's sound to its pictures as he edited and mixed his way towards a final version. Without it he had to use a slow workaround that added many days to his schedule. Apple insisted that the plug-in wasn't available ahead of its release date. They insisted that it wouldn't be right to let him use software that wasn't ready for the prime-time yet. Which all sounds quite reasonable. Except that they'd already let their beta testers have a copy. And it worked. And Walter Murch knew it worked because the consultant he'd hired to help him use Final Cut Pro had a copy. Walter could watch his consultant put the plug-in through its paces right in front of his eyes, but Apple wouldn't permit Walter to do the same. Of course he could have secretly gone ahead and used it, but Walter Murch doesn't seem to be that sort of person. And the story would have come out. One of the highest profile editors in the history of Hollywood using illegal copies of software wouldn't look good. So instead he beseeched Apple for many weeks. Frequently they didn't reply, or if they did, they maintained their position: can't help.

The plug-in was for tying sound and pictures together. Walter Murch is a bit unique when it comes to doing just that. Not only does he edit film, he mixes sound. Not too many people do both. Hardly anyone does both well. And no one but Walter has won an Oscar for both on the same movie.

Here's what I would have done. It's probably what you would have done too. I'd have made a fuss of Walter, but I would have expressed my gravest concerns about what would happen if the plug-in screwed up. I would have got Walter to agree that because he was using software that hadn't completed its testing yet, he shouldn't criticise it should it let him down. In Walter's case a handshake would have sealed that deal. In fact, Walter Murch seems to be the sort of man who would have arrived at that very view without anyone having to spell it out. And then, I would have made sure he had everything he wanted: spare Macs, an engineer on 24-hour call-out, the private number of someone senior to call if he needed something. And once one of the greatest editors in Hollywood history had finished assembling  a soon-to-be-classic Hollywood movie using my software, I would have asked him if he could contribute a few interviews and endorsements. Because really, to give one or two analogies, if NASA wants to use one of your computers on a Shuttle mission, you say 'yes'; or if David Beckham wants to try out your new sports drink, you say 'yes'; or if the SAS want to field-test a few pairs of your boots, you say 'yes'. 

I should think a smart business like Apple probably arrived at this conclusion eventually (though they've never publicly altered their position) but these opportunities require agility if you're to capitalise on them. And I suspect you have to get into the habit of reacting quickly - maybe have two or three little experiments on the go at all times - and figure out in advance which kinds of chances to jump on and which to pass up. Some won't work out, others will provide almost unlimited free publicity - publicity that just isn't available to buy. Not that Apple is lacking in that department, but it's always frustrating to see a company famed for its lateral-thinking and innovation dropping the metaphorical ball. 

Reading the e-mail exchanges, I kept waiting for Steve Jobs to jump in and say ""let's seize this chance"", but that never happened. And now that Anthony Minghella is no longer with us, that's an opportunity that will never come again. He sounds like a thoroughly decent guy (especially for a director).

- don't try to build a billion dollar company
- don't build with the aiming of selling out for a gazillion dollars to Google
- selling to consumers is a lot harder than selling to businesses
- focus on the Fortune 5,000,000 - the medium sized companies who are looking for solutions to their problems every day
- don't work with the aim of having a nice life *after* you sell out - build a business that gives you a decent lifestyle *now*
- try working 5 hours a day, not 14 hours a day. Your productivity will shoot up.

Some publishers are dumb. Poor Nielsen - I do feel quite sorry for them, now, having to put up with such daftness.","","","","2008-04-22","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Ever been into Maplins? Ever heard its siren call? I can't help myself. They sell these very specific, very cheap bits of equipment like the one pictured to the left. It's a <a href=""http://www.maplin.co.uk/Search.aspx?criteria=N53AW&DOY=22m4"">security bit set</a>. That's to say it's a screwdriver with a whole range of different tips for it, all aimed at opening cases, covers and enclosures. I couldn't resist buying one. It was on special offer (12 I think). I have shelves of these sorts of things. I know: such a waste of money.

But earlier in the week Em accidentally gave her phone rather a mild tap and the screen stopped working. Holding the phone closed were teeny-tiny screws that needed a screwdriver with a star-shaped tip to undo them. And I had one. Result: ten minutes after breaking out the security bit set, the phone was working again. It more than paid for itself. Time for me to see what else they might be selling I reckon.","","","","","2008-04-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

So the delicious <a href=""http://fatgirlontherun.blogspot.com/"">SJP</a> has blog tagged me. In four years of blogging, this is my first one! This is what I, and the six people I tag next, have to do: 

- Link to the person that tagged you - i.e. me. 
- Post the rules on your blog. (check)
- Write six random things about you in a blog post. 
- Tag six people in your post. 
- Let each person know they are tagged by leaving a comment on their blog. 
- Let the tagger know your entry is up.

It's like having a second job. OK, here are the six random things, then (and I hope my #4 won't be as rude as <a href=""http://meandmybigmouth.typepad.com/scottpack/2008/04/blog-tag.html"">Scott Pack's </a>was):","1) I have a degree in archaeology. My main residual skills as a result are being able to make a rollie - including roach - in under a minute, as well as to rub some soil between my fingers, look intense, and say 'mm, friable'. 

2) When I was a kid I had an operation to correct something wrong with my feet. On my notes, the consultant surgeon described the problem as 'curly toes'. What, they couldn't come up with something even remotely medical sounding? 

3) I can name most birds on sight. Go on, try me. 

4) When I started Snowbooks I took a 93% pay cut, but I never thought I could possibly be as happy as I am now. 

5) My favourite book is Lolita by Nabokov. 

6) When I was a kid, my ambition was to be a biologist on the much talked about at the time Space Station. Then when I took my Options at school, I wasn't allowed to do biology *and* history. So I had to choose between two of my favourite subjects - just to fit in with the teachers' schedules. If everything works out, I am planning on homeschooling my kid. 

There, that should be enough for you. The people I tag now are: 

- <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/"">Rob. </a>So you won't have far to go to read his 6. 
- <a href=""http://www.fidrabooks.co.uk/blog/"">Vanessa of Scotland</a>

Six random things about me. As tagg&eacute;d by Em. As soon as my mind stops going blank. (Which is normally a difficult state to achieve. Perhaps I have discovered something useful here.)","1) I hate the sound of dogs barking. (Having been woken up by one pretty much every night for a year. Dogs themselves are OK, if they keep the noise levels down.)

2) My brother is only eighteen months younger than me so when we were little my parents used to dress us in identical clothes for events like family weddings. (Somewhere there is a picture of him and me  around age six wearing matching yellow suits with brown shirts and ties. Was that colour scheme ever in fashion, even in the olden days?)

3) I can cut open plastic packs of things like kitchen towel with my fingertips. (Might have to make a video of this one day so you can see what I mean.)

4) Even though I can't play any musical instrument, I'm quite sensitive to things being in tune. So much so that I can't listen to opera as the wide vibrato of most singers sounds like they are going out of tune a couple of times a second and so is anything but pleasant to listen to.

5) I have never grown a moustache or a beard. Not even to see what it looks like. No particular reason, besides a firm conviction that it would look rubbish. Maybe one day. 

6) I have never eaten a banana. (I ate a few when I was tiny, threw up every time, and have never got round to trying again.)

Now, someone better call the Meme Police because I'm going to violate the rules and not tag anyone. For is it not said that it is better for each to gakk unto themselves than that one shall tag unto others?","","","","2008-04-24","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Rather suitably, it's in a chapter called On Babies. 

Just when you have concocted an absurdly implausible tale about a man outside, the door opens, and a tall, severe-looking woman enters, carrying what at first sight appears to be a particularly skinny bolster, with the feathers all at one end. Instinct, however, tells you that this is the baby, and you rise with a miserable attempt at appearing eager. When the first gush of feminine enthusiasm with which the object in question is received has died out, and the number of ladies talking at once has been reduced to the ordinary four or five, the circle of fluttering petticoats divides, and room is made for you to step forward.","","","","2008-04-24","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

This morning I've been trying to fix a broken camera. It's totally obsolete now, having so few of those modern megapixels everyone loves so much. But it does, in layman's parlance, have the virtue of being 'dinky'. It will slip into a pocket, and unlike a phone camera it's easy to use. You slide the lens cover open to turn it on; it starts up instantly (or used to); then you press the button. Easy. It's not very good quality, especially compared with my amazing Nikon D40 which knows far more about photography than I ever will. But then it's not fair to compare them, because the little Sony thing is for taking pictures when you wouldn't have room or the inclination to bring a 'proper' camera. Oh, and it's a very pretty blue.","Of course none of that means anything when the thing won't work, so this morning I have - with trembling hands - been disassembling and trying to fix it. The trembling hands come from the fact that camera flashes work by gradually building up a high-voltage charge and then discharging it in a split second to power a little flash bulb. Twice this morning, I have instead discharged that multi-thousand volt charge into me. It's not dangerous because there's no current behind it, but it is acutely painful. And it also momentarily overrides all control over the affected limb causing you to involuntarily fling the camera you're delicately cradling across the room.

Not sure whether I've fixed it. I lost my appetite for repairs after the second electrocution/tourette's like outburst. But I'm hopeful that I've reached some sort of accord with it. What was quite fun, though, was realising that there were pictures in its memory that I hadn't looked at since they were taken.

I want to write this post because over the last couple of weeks I've had a few emails and comments that include, in passing, thanks and kind wishes to me about how hard I work. Hmm. I'm not so sure that I do and I don't want to be a big old martyr type of person, smiling weakly as people fan me with leaves as I bravely struggle on - because it's not like that at all. So I thought I'd spill the beans on exactly what it is that I do with my days. 

Warning: stupidly long post.","Having said that I don't work very hard, we do seem to run an entire business with only three people, so what I really want to talk about is productivity. 

Generally speaking, here are some principles I employ: 

1) Work, not manage
Although it was nice at the time to have a team and work in the office every day, the difference to my productivity now I don't have a team to manage is amazing (Anna, being in MN, is self reliant!) I get three times as much done because I'm not talking all day. And of course I can work from home in the countryside, which is heaven. That includes keeping meetings to a bare minimum, as well as phone calls - I find email much more useful. Meetings and phone chats are nice enough, but not actually necessary. Sometimes, in fact, an email is better than a meeting because you have notes to refer back to easily. And I can tackle email in my own time (I get 50 actual emails a day, (and 2000-3000 junk which get filtered away) which I do in batches rather than as they arrive - seems to take so much less time. 

2) Use scheduling tools
I use <a href=""https://www.rememberthemilk.com/"">Remember the Milk</a> and Outlook tools. I have automated replies called Quick Parts which I use when I'm sending exactly the same email ('sorry, we don't publish childrens or poetry; please process this order for me') or snippet of email ('Hi there, it was so lovely to see you at Frankfurt' - then the rest personalised). In RTM I have various lists including a Waiting For list (very handy to contain things you need to chase up), a 2009 books ideas list, a One Day list and an On Hold list. Other lists are Snowbooks Company, Snowbooks Titles, Snowangels, and Personal. You save a task and give it a date you're going to do it - and I just make sure every day I do all my tasks. It's very motivational for me - it's how I work best. 

3) Automate 
Forget location, location, location - I like Automate, Automate, Automate! It makes such sense to get repetitive tasks automated. I'd say that was the key to keeping a small team and low overheads. 

4) Work is also my hobby 
Let's face it - although I don't work stupidly hard, I don't really stop at the weekends. See, I love my job, because it isn't a job - it's how I choose to spend a lot of my life. I would never do bookkeeping or dull stuff at the weekend, though - it's Special Project time (see below). Anyway, I have Wednesday afternoons off for Movie Night so it's like time in lieu. 

Regarding time I spend at my desk, it's 7-7 on a Monday, 7-9 or 10 on a Tuesday, 9-1 or 2, sometimes 3 or 4 on a Wednesday, 9-5 on a Thursday (then I drive to London), 9.30-4 on a Friday (then we drive back from London), and I have the laptop open pretty much all weekend. BUT you have to factor in a lot of googling, wikipediaing, reading of the Bookseller and the Guardian, reading blogs, XKCD, and staring at bunnies on the lawn. I start at 7 on Mondays and Tuesdays because I get up to take And to the station early. On Weds and Thurs I laze around in bed a bit longer. So it's a fair old week, but it's taken at a gentle pace. 

And now the actual tasks that I do, so you can see that whilst there are plenty of them, they're approached in a way that is pretty efficient and manageable. They are divided into things that have to be done regularly, things that have to be done once or twice a year, and special projects. 

<strong>1) Regular tasks.</strong>

<strong>Bibliographic data management: </strong>I send a weekly update to Nielsen, Bowker and BDS. Since it takes two keystrokes to output an ONIX message from the Anko Publishing Manager that we run, that task takes no more than 10 mins a week. I update the database as updates arise and as I remember - new reviews, availability, price changes (not that we do many of them.) 

<strong>Bookkeeping and accounts: </strong>I do the following weekly: 
<em>Update Northwind:</em> Northwind is our management reporting tool. Rob and I have got it so it's totally automated (except for one thing which we'll do one day). It grabs the (crappily formatted) sales, stock and returns data from LBS's 'r2w' system, reformats it (back into a raw data format - shame they have to prettify it in the first place when we just turn it back again, but you know what boys and their data warehouses are like), runs a set of calculations and spits out a weekly profit and loss account for each title. Very handy. I am bad, though, and tend to run it myself, look at the numbers and then fail to update Rob and Anna properly. I've got back into the swing of proper reporting now, though, and have just completed a massive TPS report (Trading Performance of Snowbooks Report, with hat tip to Office Space) summarising our performance over the last couple of years. I particularly liked the green shading I used to format the report - after all, style over content is what matters. (Ooh, for a moment there I thought I was back at Deloitte.)

I do the following every two weeks: 
<em>Cash flow forecast: </em>I maintain a working spreadsheet in excel which is a record of all current and projected bills, all forecast income and current bank account. This is actually a manual duplication from Sage, which isn't very efficient, but it is accurate and this is such an important area it needs to be done. 
<em>Invoicing and bills: </em>Since we do consultancy as well as book publishing, I have to raise invoices. Thankfully LBS do the credit control, billing and cash collection for the thousands of individual bookstore transactions we do. I pay the bills when they're due, and chase invoices before they're due, every other week usually. Funnily enough, for all my talk of automation, I like to write cheques rather than use online transfers. It means I have a paper trail that really helps me with my bank recs. Also, the money stays in Snowbooks' account just that tiny bit longer. I run payroll monthly - takes ten minutes. 

I do the following monthly: 
<em>Current account reconciliation:</em> when the bank statement arrives, I rec it immediately. There are some items I can't rec, like the income from LBS (on the bank statement there is the monthly number received into the bank, but in Sage there is the net revenue ny week, the trust account entries, then invoices from LBS. I let Kundan our bookkeeper do this because, though I've tried numerous times, it's bloody complicated and I don't want to mess it up) but in general most of the entries are done as soon as I get the statement. Some of the entries will have been entered as I write cheques, etc, but I tend to wait till the statement's in then blitz it. 
<em>Barclaycard reconciliation:</em> same deal here. As soon as the statement comes in, I enter all the transactions and do the rec. It's easier than waiting to do the rec in one big batch. 

<strong>Website maintenance</strong>
I did a refreshed design at Christmas 2007 which is XHTML and CSS compliant. If I get itchy fingers and want to do a redesign,  I just have to rewrite the CSS (the bit that controls the design and formatting, not the content). Author pages, title pages, AIs and catalogue pages are all automated. I tend to do a major refresh once a month, and redo all these automated pages, which takes about half an hour. 
Some other pages have to be manually updated, like the home page, bookseller and author information pages and, of course, the blog. Rob and I probably spend half an hour to an hour between us a day updating the blog, I'd say. 
Most other Snowbooks things on the net are automatically updated, or ignored. Twitter and Squidoo are automatic; I don't bother updating Second Life and Myspace and I occasionally update Facebook, YouTube and Scribd. (Links at the bottom of any webpage on snowbooks.com.)

<strong>Production management </strong>
Haynes, our printers, are very good indeed and don't actually need all that much management. A year and a half ago I tendered our print, and Haynes came out on top on all measures. We have saved 50% on our print bills (which makes me very cross at the previous printer, who I can't help but think was shafting us). 

<strong>Creation of books</strong>
Ah! Something specific to publishing! At last. Anna creates all the files for her books; I do mine. I tend to manage the printers, though, so they have one point of contact. I use <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Covers%20calculator.xls"">this file </a>to calculate the file sizes which I wrote. You can donate money to Snowbooks if you use it and find it useful (or if you've got more money than you know what to do with, for instance).

With regard to the insides of books, they <em>are</em> time consuming, to say the least, especially the four colour ones which need a photoshoot, photo editing, a lot of editing, careful layout and illustrations. If I had just a bit more money I would probably hire an external proofreader as proofreading one book can take three days - probably not the best use of my time.  But that's all as it should be; we're a book publisher, so we should spend the majority of our time on the books. 

<strong>Sales</strong>
Thank god for Allison and Busby! Susie, Lesley and team have taken a huge amount of admin and worry off my hands by making sure that all the various retailer deadlines are met, forms are submitted, meetings are held, AIs are presented, books are provided and blads and samples are chased up. Thank you, ladies, you've improved my life - and sales. 

<strong>Marketing</strong>
This includes PR, which is done by the excellent Cerub PR. Review copies are sent out by LBS, nowadays, so I don't have to spend hours packing up books and carrying them to the post office, and I send an email to let people know the book's on its way. Most other marketing is pretty well automated now - a few years of building up mailing lists, contacts and relationships means that I don't have to start from scratch on each project - and of course all our authors are excellent at identifying relevant, specific reviewers and marketing opportunities. 

What I don't do is a lot of running around organising festivals, days out, evenings out, events, signings, author tour things and so on. I just don't enjoy the hard work and the time away from the business. I feel sure it would sell a handful more books, but to be honest the extra work, extra money and energy I'd have to expend would be massive, the rewards in sales modest and the effect on profit negligible. I feel a bit guilty about this from time to time, but if I did all those extra things I really wouldn't have time for much else. Something has to give - and it may as well be the part I don't enjoy. 

<strong>2) Once or twice a year tasks</strong>

<em>Royalties: </em>Ah, royalties. I have the whole system automated, but then spend about four days checking, checking and checking again. It's too much money leaving the business in one go to make a mistake - and if a mistake is made, I can't very well ask for it back. Interestingly, I have heard from other publishers that some bought systems for managing royalties have some worrying flaws - like, for instance, one system can't cope with rounding very well, and if a large publisher runs it, all those rounding errors can add up to tens of thousands of pounds. I guess I'll stick with my obsessive compulsive approach for the time being. 

<em>Catalogue: </em>As you know, I've automated this. It now takes eight minutes. Lovely. 

<em>Bookfairs: </em>LBF and Frankfurt take a week each. We exhibit with the IPG which saves a lot of time, money and aggro since we don't have to build or break down the stands. I think if we had to do this, we wouldn't bother.

<em>Statutory stuff:</em> includes P35s, P11ds, tax return, annual accounts and so on. Much of this is done by our excellent accountants, Vantis, so takes about a day a year.  

<em>Prize entries:</em> both for books and business. I have a list of prizes which I enter every book for, within the guidelines. And I enter the Nibbies and the IPA awards, as you know. It takes a Saturday per entry, and I think it's worth it.  

<strong>3) Special projects</strong>

You see, I just can't help but tinker. Special projects get me very excited: like writing websites, writing presentations (I'm doing one at the BA conference soon), doing IT projects like making Indesign use XML, and  using Java, thinking about and writing proposals for joint ventures, and so on. But these do tend to be at the weekend, which is why I mentioned that it's helpful if your work is also your hobby. 

<strong>Things I don't do</strong>

One person can't do everything. For instance, I haven't cooked a meal in five years, and I never wash up. We live in a very egalitarian household, you see. I don't really socialise, either, which I'm perfectly happy about. I like it at home with the cats and Andy, and Rob down the road and the internet. Sad, maybe, but I'm happy.  

And as I say, there are things I just don't do that other publishers do - like arranging author tours and events. I provide books if authors want that stuff for themselves, but I don't think those things are profitable activities and don't go out of my way to arrange them.

So you can see, I hope, that though a lot goes in to running a business, we have it pretty well under control, and as much of it automated as possible. So don't feel *too* sorry for me and all the work I have to do! And never feel  - especially authors - that you can't get in touch or ask me to do things because you think I'm too busy. I'm not, promise, and I enjoy it.","","","","2008-04-29","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","5"

I've just been told by Mike Fell of <a href=""http://litro.co.uk/index.php"">Litro</a> that a short story by one Robert Finn will be appearing in next week's edition. Litro, for anyone not familiar with it, is a sort of literary alternative to the Metro (one of the free London papers). It's available to commuters, and others, who might fancy reading a bit of fiction on their journey. It pops up at the places listed <a href=""http://litro.co.uk/distribution.php"">here</a>, so look out for it. The Robert Finn story is in a very different vein to his usual work (we did sneak a link to it into a former blog post - but perhaps we'll do so a bit more overtly after the Litro edition has been distributed). If you look around, you'll see that the Litro site also has an <a href=""http://litro.co.uk/fiction.php"">archive</a> which holds all their former editions. Lots there to dig into for anyone interested.","","","","","2008-05-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

I have a contentious thing to say. Feel free to fight with me. It concerns the role of agents.","Agents are advocates of the author, throughout their long term career, right, whereas usually a publisher buys a book at a time. There are two and three book deals, and publishers often hope to recoup the initial investment in a debut novel by signing up the subsequent books, but if an author is agented, it's the agent's job to sell each book that an author writes, to the author and agent's best advantage. In other words, it's an agent's job to manage the career of the author.  

Not too contentious so far. But let's think this through. 

It's a widely held belief in publishing that, for the most part, reviews don't sell books. Reviews are primarily to make authors feel better. I don't say this lightly: I have several years experience of seeing what affects sales. I am also very clear on the p&l of getting reviews. The costs are: staff and time costs in getting the book ready early enough to print a proof, creating the printer files and paying for the printing proof copies, spending time, or paying someone to draw up a list of who to send copies to, asking those people if they'd like a copy, and the cost and time of posting them. Remember that to get one review you probably have to send out 30 or 40 copies, since it's hard to get them. The sales spike I see as a result of this investment is never sufficient to cover the outlay. I am not alone: I know editors from major independent and conglomerate publishers who say exactly the same thing, sometimes directly to their authors. Reviews may have a long term effect on establishing an author; they may have a positive psychological effect on the author which helps her to write even better books; they may make the author feel that the publisher is doing something worthwhile; they may even sell some books. But rarely do they sell sufficient to cover the costs of soliciting the reviews. 

(A brief aside: I class reviews as different to endorsements. I think having a line from a respected author on the front cover of a book makes a difference.)

(And as a further, psychological, aside, I know all this about reviews and yet I continue to solicit them. It's part of the 'hope' aspect of publishing - that nothing is certain, nothing is set in stone and since we don't, really, know what sells books (otherwise as an industry we'd publish a fraction of what we do and they'd all sell a lot more) we have to try everything. The evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of ditching the idea of getting reviews, yet still I do it. I am some sort of mug. Anyway, asides over.)

So you would be hard pressed to argue that reviews sell books in sufficient quantities to make the effort worthwhile.*  And we agree that it's the agent's role to nurture and bolster and support authors through the long term. So, finally, to the contentious bit: since the agent is responsible for the career of the author, and since reviews are primarily solicited for the benefit of authors, then I think the agent should be responsible for soliciting, paying for and achieving reviews of the author's books. 

Come on. Tell me how wrong I am. But provide statistically sound evidence. 

Oh, and also: this is all strictly hypothetical. I am going to continue to solicit reviews. I just wish that agents did a bit more for their 10%. 

* Cue clamouring from readers of the Snowblog saying ""I read reviews and buy books based on them"". Yes, but you are special. Here you are, reading a publisher's blog. You are so dedicated to books, and reading is so important to you, that you are even interested in the industry surrounding them. You, I am afraid to say, are in the minority. When I say 'reviews don't sell books' it's shorthand for 'reviews don't sell sufficient books to make the time, money and energy spent on soliciting reviews a profitable exercise'. 

//update: and please see my clarification in the comments below about what I mean by a review. Summary: I am not talking about bloggers reviews which I think are highly effectual and trackable, not least because as soon as you've read the review and are inspired you can click through to the book on Amazon, Play, TBD, Snowbooks.com or whereever the blogger has linked to and buy it then and there, rather than having to wait until next time you're out shopping. Plus bloggers don't get funny about having the book 6 months before publication - they are happy with a finished copy. No, in this post I'm talking about broadsheets and journals. //","","","","2008-05-03","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","11"

I've tried to keep baby stuff to a minimum on here, but I think I'll do sporadic updates just so you're in the know! People uninterested in anything to do with pregnancy (which was me until 19 weeks ago) look away now.","So currently I'm in the 18th week (of 40): nearly half way, then. I have what they call an anomaly scan at 20 weeks so am looking forward to that, because I'm just assuming there won't be any anomalies (if there are, worrying about it won't help) and there's a chance we can find out the gender, unless it's being very coy. Some people are anti-finding out the sex, others really want to. I figure that there are going to be so many surprises and new things to deal with that having one big thing known in advance is better. 

Andy and I are going to enrol in hypnobirthing classes in a couple of weeks, too. It doesn't stop it being painful, but it does stop you tensing up as much and if I've learned anything from martial arts it's that the body works a lot better, and hurts a lot less, when it's not tense.

Regarding fatness: I am fat. No question about it. My thighs rub together  - they don't just brush, they rub - which has to be one of the grossest feelings ever to be experienced in life. I have put on 18 pounds in 18 weeks, thanks to my own peculiar brand of morning sickness which meant I felt sick unless I had toast in my stomach. I have huge knockers (which apparantly will get huger) and a big, round, pregnant belly. And I'm not even half way through yet. But, oddly, I still have a waist which makes all the difference in the world. Just so long as I wear my amazing maternity jeans (Next) or my amazing trousers (Isabella Oliver) and a bump band, I look relatively nice. In fact, I probably look bloody sexy, what with all the curves and that, if you go for that sort of thing. And whereas normally I would be horrified about being so voluminous, what can I do? I don't seem to be too bothered. 

Regarding sickness: it is over. I wouldn't say I'm blooming, but I'm definitely feeling happy as larry. That'll be the hormones. They really should bottle them. Nothing seems weird: the fact there's a melon-sized alien in my belly stealing my nutrients doesn't seem weird, which is weird. My hair is quite nice, except for that my Cruella de Ville white streak is ultra pronounced because you're not meant to dye your hair in pregnancy. In fact, I feel very well indeed - if a bit out of puff sometimes as the last vestiges of my fitness crumble away. (Also I read that the hormones and the squishing of lungs make you breathless. I'm hoping it's more that than being dreadfully unfit, which is sadly more like it.)

Oh, and s/he's kicking! With his or her little noodley appendages. That's what it feels like - little noodley arms and legs kicking and punching. Perhaps I am carrying the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster"">second coming.</a> 

We have decided on names - two for each sex. I'm not telling you them, though, because you might not like them and then we'd fall out. 

I am obsessed by fruit, now that the toast phase is over. Satsumas, pineapple, berries, bananas and more satsumas are my favourite. I am also enjoying avocado, tomato, purple sprouting broccolli, cabbage, leek and kale. Oh, and parsley with everything. And yoghurts.  (Not parsley and yoghurt together, though. That would be silly.)

So, in summary, all is progressing nicely and with the minimum amount of bother; much fruit is being consumed and all is well with the world.","","","","2008-05-04","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","10"

Sack the boss 
By Rhymer Rigby 

Published: May 4 2008 16:33 

Emma Barnes, managing director and co-founder of Snowbooks, a UK publisher, recalls the steps that led her to resign in 2001 from Kingfisher, the retail group. As a fresh graduate, Id drunk the fast-track Kool-Aid [believing I would reach] senior management in seven years. But then she had an epiphany. I found I was working 14-hour days  and for what? Selling bin bags to people. It was meaningless. 

So, she decided to quit. I didnt want to burn my bridges so I did my ranting to my friends at the pub and then went into my bosss office and basically fibbed. I said Id been offered an amazing opportunity and I hoped we would keep in touch . . . You do have to assume youll meet people again and it would be foolish to speak your mind. 

While there is a great deal of career advice on how to get the job you desire, there is little guidance on how to reject the job you no longer want. So, how do you resign? 

Ann Gales, a partner at the headhunter Heidrick & Struggles (whose work occasions a fair number of resignations), says: Do it professionally. Prepare thoroughly and think about how you do it beforehand. Id always do it in person unless that was impossible. Think about the future, be as positive as possible and leave on as good terms as possible. Make sure that you hand over your projects properly so that your exit period is well managed. 

The main reason to stick to the script is the need to retain control, advises Sarah Sweetman, of the business psychologists Organisational Edge. Resignation scenarios can be quite emotionally charged  Im leaving because I hate you, I have a better offer  stuff it. But the second you raise the temperature and start to antagonise the other person, the possibility of losing control of the situation raises its head. 

She adds that a well-mannered, controlled resignation is as much about being remembered well as making a clean exit. It is perhaps for these reasons that virtually all the witty resignation letters found floating about on the internet  most of which take the form of an amusing professional assassination of an incompetent boss  turn out to be fakes. 

Much as hardly anyone ever gives a bad reference, so too are honest resignations seldom seen: it is simply easier for everyone concerned if, as Ms Barnes puts it, you basically fib. Besides, you are in some ways sacking your boss. And actions speak louder than words. 

Assuming you have some respect for your boss and company, you should be sensitive. You need to consider the impact on the manager and how to handle that, Ms Barnes says. 

Ms Sweetman takes a similar view: You also have to think about the person on the receiving end. How do they feel? While you shouldnt expose your emotional state, you should not antagonise them either. Both responses mean that you lose control of the situation. She cautions that even if the manager asks you a question whose honest answer may be insulting, youre better off saying youd need to think about it.

Alternatively, the person receiving your resignation may refuse to accept it or may make a tempting counter-offer. In the first case, you need to stick to your guns. In the second, you may wish to reconsider. Ms Gales says that although some managers may not react well to a resignation, most people do accept it  but you may need to give them a cooling-off period. 

So it would seem the best way of resigning is to keep it short and sweet. My advice [is that] its like ripping off a plaster, says Jonathan Kelsey, who resigned from the shoemaker Jimmy Choo to set up his own shoe company. Get it over with. 

However, in certain situations, resignation may not be best the route at all  you may be better off waiting to be sacked. Most people who resign in the public arena are pushed, says Greg Dyke, who quit the position of director-general of the BBC following heavy criticism of the public broadcasters news reporting processes in the Hutton report. 

A lot of people resign to try to save face but they really shouldnt, Mr Dyke continues. It depends on whether theyre right or wrong. If theyre right, theyre better off standing up and saying: Bugger you. Youll have to sack me. In retrospect, I wish I had.

And I haven't posted for a few days. I have been busy, and also it's been gorgeous out there so I've done more than my usual amount of being outside, and also Rob isn't here which for some reason has affected my blogging rate. I think we have chats about things and get each other fired up which leads to a blog post, and that hasn't happened so much. But he's back from his exciting holidays tomorrow which is nice for me, maybe less nice for him. 

I did actually write three blog posts, but they are not to be published. Sometimes when something has annoyed me I blog about it, and then carefully make sure the post is set to 'unpublished'. It's excellently cathartic, stops me fuming and keeping such posts unpublished avoids me getting into trouble. I usually write a much more tempered version a few days later, so they are quite useful source material! I suppose in this respect a blog is less useful than a diary, which is secret and so there's no problem, but I can't be bothered to maintain a blog and a diary. 

To make up for my (published) blog silence, here are some nice photos to illustrate my week.","Firstly, my girth @ week 19. 

<img alt=""week19.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/week19.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""364"" />

No posts for 3 days then two in one hour. Maybe I'm just angling for the prize for blog post 1000 (this is number 972). 

This is a post for people who run companies that are office based. You might like to know how my days in the office break down compared to my working from home days. If you can't be bothered to click to read on, the summary is that I get approximately one million times more things done at home than in the office. It's genuinely worth thinking about whether your business would be more productive if you sent everyone home.","Here is what happens on a typical office day: 

8.30 Leave the house. At the moment I'm walking to work, which is invigorating. 
9.20 Arrive at the office. 
9.20 - 9.30 Chat to ladies on reception
9.30 - 9.40 Pick up post and parcels. Chat to George in post room. Go upstairs to office
9.45 - 10.30 Check and reply to email. 
10.30 - 11.30 Get nobbled by someone in the office (I share with Kogan Page and do a spot of PubServ work for them, so there's usually something going on.)
11.30 - noon Open post, look at letters. 
Noon - 12.30 Go round the corner to get some lunch. 
12.30 - 12.40 Eat lunch at desk
12.45 Leave office to go to meeting in town. I'm in the office so rarely I tend to have meetings most days I'm there. 
12.45 - 1pm Walk to Kings X
1.00 - 1.40 Travel to meeting
1.45 - 3 Have meeting
3.00 - 3.40 Travel back to office
3.40 - 4.00 Do some work. 
4.00 Go home on bus, to get car to pick up Andy at 5 to travel back to the countryside. 

You'll note that in that day there is 20 minutes of work. Now compare a day at home. 

6am Get up and get ready, to take Andy to the station. 
7.20 Back from station and at desk
7.20 - 8.20 Write blog post, answer remaining emails from previous day, check rememberthemilk to do list. 
8.20 - noon Work on to do list
Noon Get lunch from fridge that Andy has made for me (I told you I never cook). Eat at desk
12.10 - 3 Work on to do list
3.00 - 3.15 Tea break
3.20 - 7 Work on to do list
7 Get dinner from fridge and heat up. Eat at desk
7.20 - 9pm Work on to do list. 

In that day, you'll note, I do many hours of work - actual work, not meetings, or emails. 

Seriously, business owners - find a way to escape your staff from meetings, office chat and faffing and you may find yourself with an entirely different business.","","","","2008-05-10","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Sorry for the blog-dearth of late. I've been frolicking about in the States (and then chain-snoozing since I got back) and Em has been off prize-hunting at the BA conference - which is just embarrassing if you've ever seen it: Em takes her big carpet bag with her to Brighton and starts pestering people to give her prizes. ""Can I have that prize?"" ""Well, this one is for literary agents. Are you a literary agent?"" ""Might be. What about that shiny one? Can I have that one?"" ""Well, this one is for innovation. Have you innovated much recently?"" ""Probly. So can I have it?"" And this goes on until someone weakens and says ""Oh, OK"" and another prize goes into the carpet bag.

Anyway, now that I'm back and reasonably <em>compos mentis</em> I just wanted to tell you about a purchase I made while abroad which fits very well with one of <a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/"">Maestro Godin</a>'s views on Valued Customers. I bought a <a href=""http://www.serenitymovie.com/"">Collectors' Edition of the movie Serenity</a>. This is not shocking news in itself, except that I already own an excellent DVD of that movie. I bought this one because it has Bonus Material. The cast and director got together three years after the movie was made to record a second commentary. Is that - plus a few other odds and ends - really worth $21, given that I already own a copy of the film itself? And the answer to that is obviously 'No'. Except if it's one of your favourite movies and you're a bit obsessive about the cast and crew and how the movie got made.","So the market for Collector's Editions and the like might sound like a very small group of people. And the fact that this is a sci-fi movie drives home that point. We all know that sci-fi fans are 'special'. We've certainly learned to associate a heightened level of intensity with fans of sci-fi films and TV. But the fact is that most of us are what the Japanese call '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku"">otaku</a>' about something. We buy digitally re-mastered Beatles recordings that we already own on vinyl and regular CD. Or we have two copies of our favourite books, one for reading and another perfect first-edition copy saved for the day when the works of our favourite author replace uncut diamonds or bearer bonds as tokens of pure, concentrated value.

This comes back to what S. Godin was saying about future revenue streams for industries which inspire this sort of loyalty. In fact, it's most relevant to industries where not only are there hardcore fans, there is also an ongoing process of disintermediation and piracy which threatens to disrupt the traditional flows of income. 

It is now possible to acquire almost any piece of music without paying for it, and to do so at least as quickly and conveniently as downloading it legitimately - or worse still, visiting a store. Compare the process of snagging an illegal copy of an album off the internet with a trip to WHSmiths, including waiting for the bus both ways, possibly in the rain, and it's a wonder that the music industry persists at all. 

Movies aren't far behind. British Telecom's dawdling and hamfisted plan (c.f. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21cn"">21CN</a>) to eventually move the UK's internet connections over to what was considered state of the art in the year 2000 will delay the advent of full-scale movie piracy in Britain. But elsewhere, and for anyone with a cable internet connection, downloading a movie at DVD quality gets easier the whole time.

And personally I believe that the advent of a really gorgeous, practical and cheap e-reader (probably combining functions such as phone, iPod, sat-nav and PDA) will tip the book industry in that direction too. Many people only realised they needed a new phone when they saw the iPhone, or a new iPod when they saw the iTouch. I've said it before, but if Apple ever pour a bag of magic marketing and design dust over an e-reader, electronic books will suddenly start looking as tasty as brains to a zombie. And even though all the commercially available e-readers will be much more restrictive in what they'll permit you to do with your books than the paper version, twenty minutes after they're released the hackers of the world will have cracked open every piece of security, copy protection, DRM and encryption, and books will flood out onto the net in even greater numbers than they already do. After which commercial e-readers with no DRM installed (or hacked-open versions of restrictive readers) will be used to read that content. It will only be a trickle to start with, but that trickle will only ever increase.

As <a href=""http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/14/why-publishing-shoul.html"">Mr C. Doctorow</a> says, it will never be more difficult to make copies of things than it is right now: meaning that piracy and piratical distribution of anything and everything will only get easier.

But you know all this. Or rather, you know that I believe all of these things. The point I wanted to make goes back to the Collectors' Edition of Serenity. What happens when the convenience of piracy butts up against the scruples of the true fan. Yes, you'd illegally download music, but would you listen to your favourite band in the world without paying them a cent for the privilege? And what about your favourite movie or book?

At the moment, most media companies use a big stick to protect their revenues. They threaten and sue. Wouldn't it be interesting to see if the power of love worked better? Will the special connection we feel for our favourite bands and authors outweigh our temptation to deny the faceless corporations their next dip into our wallets? Mr Godin has talked about business models built upon a small customer-base who love you rather than a large customer-base who tolerate you. Might the slightly irrational bond we feel regarding favourite diversions do more to ensure that authors and musicians have a roof over their heads than any brigade of lawyers? I suspect it would. The problem is that the protective effects of that fan-love don't extend to the middlemen: which in the case of books is us.","","","","2008-05-14","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

is the sound that two nibbies and an IPA award make when banged together, which is what I've just been doing. Huzzah, we won the Innovation Nibbie last night.","Here's what I think I said, or should have said, when I collected it on behalf of all of us (I have a feeling it came out far more garbled than this, but since I was in that state of freeze-frame shock that getting a nice prize generates, I can't really remember)

""Stutter, mumble, er, thank you very much indeed, pause, pause. I'd like to dedicate this award to The Book. I won't go into the details of our XSL project, but we wanted to make the most of our ONIX data. We didn't want to hire expensive consultants, so we bought a couple of books on XSL. One was 27.99, the other 14.99. They saved two to three months work per year as a result of reading them and learning from them. Compared to hiring a consultant for thousands or going on a training course, these two books gave amazing value for money. So hooray for the book."" 

Or something. It was definitely less eloquent than that, and that's not even eloquent. Still, you get the gist. 

Thanks to Nielsen for the award, who as Matthew pointed out in the comments in the previous post I'm always so rude to. Not just on the blog, either - I managed to take them to task at breakfast, lunch and dinner at the conference. Poor Nielsen, and when they give us such nice prizes, too. And sincere thanks to the judges for recognizing what we've done and thinking it was as neat as we do. 

And now, having said that those two books we bought were amazing value and better than consultants, if you'd like to hire me and Rob to help you make the most of your ONIX data, then <a href=""mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"">shout! </a>

And huge congrats to both Mr B's and Mostly Books who won Independent Bookseller and New Independent Bookseller respectively. Bloody well done, both, and richly deserved.","","","","2008-05-14","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

At the BA conference I gave a pitch, as part of the Next Big Thing discussion, for a new innovation called BookBackers. As with most things at Snowbooks, BookBackers is Rob's idea which I pinched for the BA conference, and I'm sure he'll be adding in a more erudite way than me to this idea over the next few weeks. But in the meantime, here's the transcript of the presentation, dreadful lame jokes and all. If you'd like to see the slides that go along with it, <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/BookBackers%20fin.pdf"">here they are</a>
 (PDF,451kb). The dots in the text below indicate a new slide!","Hello, as you can see from this slides reassuringly large letters which is a useful prompt in case nerves get the better of me and I forget my name and the companies with which I am afflilated, my name is Emma Barnes and I run Snowbooks, a small independent publisher, and Snowangels, a publishing services business doing things like cover design and making the most of ONIX data. Please do not be alarmed: the next big thing I am here to talk about is not my ever expanding pregnant belly, forthcoming and gravid though it is. No, I am here to talk to you about the reader. 

Uh, no, not that reader, slinky and gorgeous though it is. 

This sort of reader. 

Or maybe this one, to bring us a bit more up to date. Yes, the reader: as an industry the thought of her flits across our mind from time to time. Publishers might have a couple of references to her on their retailer presentations, AIs might note that a book appeals to the reader who enjoyed the last Philippa Gregory. The reader is, after all, the lifeblood of our industry. But do we really care about her? About what she thinks? About whether she enjoyed the book you sold her last week? If we do care, it doesnt show. We spend a fraction of the time and money that other industries invest in trying to understand the reader. Book Marketing Limited is a fine company, but it is the only company dedicated to research in our industry. For a 2.7bn industry, our spend on top quality, deep consumer research is negligible. 

Procter and Gamble, for instance, spend $200m just on consumer research every year. Their turnover is $76bn, so to pro-rata that to, say, the Hachette group who turn over 1.9bn, Hachette would have to spend 6m a year to match that sort of level of interest  not on advertising, or marketing, or product development, but on customer insight research alone. Bet they dont. 

Why dont we spend as much as Procter and Gamble and their ilk? Because books  are not toothpaste. We dont rely on customers coming back, week after week, to buy the same brand. They buy a book, they move on. If they enjoy the author, theyll buy the next book by that author  but thats after months, maybe years. Our modus operandi as an industry is not to create twenty brands and sell a million units, a billion pounds worth of each every year: we are far more scattergun in our approach. So really, just so long as we get our readers money, were happy. Theres not much use in us understanding exactly why she bought it, or what she thinks, because we dont need her to buy the same book next week, and the week after. Toothpaste is a repeat purchase; a book is a one off.  

And even if we did spend that much money, many market research methods are well known to be flawed. EPOS data, built up to give a national picture, tells us what people bought, but not why. Consumer panels and focus groups ask people about their purchases but by shining a spotlight on their behaviour, consumers are more likely to make things up  not because theyre lying, but because a lot of shopper behaviour is subconscious. Methods like filming and eye tracking are a lot more robust but we still cant see inside peoples heads. 

So whats to be done? We continue to publish books with our fingers crossed, hoping that out of all the activities we flail around doing, something magical will happen and well get that elusive Word of Mouth. Heres the model we work on at the moment: 

An agent selects a book on gut feel and whether they think they can sell it. 
A publisher selects a book on pretty much the same criteria. 
The retailer selects the book based on the cover design and whether its in a genre that they know sells well. 
The reader  the poor reader at the end  selects a book based on  what? The cover, the blurb, maybe reviews, maybe because theyve seen it around or heard about it, maybe the first page. Its all a bit hit and miss. We have no idea whether that reader has just discovered her favourite book of all time, or threw the book against the bedroom wall when shes on page 150 because she cant bear to read another page. We just dont know. And because were having to trick the reader into buying a book  to force them to buy the books we want them to buy  thats a pricey process. We have to spend money trying to drum up demand, to force demand, through adverts and POS and price offers. 

It would be so much better  more predictable, more efficient  if the model was joined up, and demand  real demand  already existed. 

If we knew what readers were thinking, agents would base their selection based on their own taste but informed by reader insight. And so round the supply circle it would go: the publisher would make their decision based on what the readers are telling them, and the bookseller would be able to make a decision based on data, rather than a nice cover and the rep hyping on about how much money the publisher is going to spend on POS. At the point of selection, the reader could have information gathered by the industry available to them to make informed decisions, and as the industry solicits feedback the loop is completed. 

Yeah, whatever. Looks great on the page. Nice powerpoint slides of pyramids versus circles. How very 1990s. Its all great in theory, but how the hell do we get this reader insight? And even if we could get it, how the hell do we act on reader feedback when its only relevant to the book shes just read? Heres how. We need to find out readers real thoughts on a book, before publication, so we can learn from it. We need to involve readers in the publication decision. We need to avoid artificial research environments like focus groups, post purchase panel surveys and exit surveys. And we need to do all this for a fraction of the normal cost of extensive research. 

Introducing BookBackers! 

Bookbackers is a way for readers to buy shares in books, so that they have an incentive to make the book work, and so that publishers know the book theyre publishing has real demand from real readers 

Heres how it works. 
	Publishers upload manuscripts to BookBackers website
	Readers, whove register as a Bookbacker, review the manuscripts and buy shares in the one they really rate (around 10 each)
	Once its published, the BookBacker is financially incentivised to spread word of mouth to make it work 
	If the book takes off, the BookBacker gets a cut. 

So to recap: what were doing here is letting readers get first look at books that they can have some say over  and a chance to share in the proceeds if it takes off. Since the popular view of publishing is that if a publisher finds one book, like Harry Potter, it can sell millions, its an exciting prospect. Think of it as a literary version of the national lottery. Heh  the national literary!

Whats in it for publishers, then? 
	We get some money to spend on the book from the initial investment by BookBackers (the people who invest their money)
	We get a ready-made army of emotionally and  financially-incentivised evangelists to spread word of mouth
	Its a cheap way to manage the slush pile, since theres no cost to putting a book on the BookBackers website, and brilliantly we get all the consumer insight that P&G get for their $200m without spending anything near that. 
	Most importantly we can publish books that people want to read, so rather than spending a fortune on marketing to force demand to appear, the demand is already there. 

How about for booksellers? 
	Youll get people to stay longer in your stores, to be more involved, to participate and to feel they're being listened to.
	Youve got various opportunities for involvement that will make you money: 
	You can host discussion events, akin to book groups, where potential investors can discuss the merits of a book. 
	You can sponsor your staff to become BookBackers, providing them with half the capital, for instance, to buy shares in books they love and then champion. Great way to make staff feel theyre being listened to. 
	You can feature books in promotions - ""the top five BookBackers books as chosen by the people of Canterbury"" - when their customers and staff have a financial stake in their success it adds a new layer of interest to a book. 
	Its a great way for booksellers - those at the sharp end of the industry, who hear reader feedback all the time but who have few opportunities to pass it back up the supply chain to publishers - to get their reader insights listened to and acted upon. 

But will this reach the masses, like Richard and Judy? Well an exciting new initiative that places the reader at the heart of things, is full of potential for all manner of media, from radio, magazines and newspapers to TV. 
	Theres scope for pitching for a TV format that either supports or uses the concept of BookBackers. 
	Successful formats to date have hinged around celebrity endorsement. TV format could involve celebrities 'having a go at publishing' with the infrastructure provided by BookBackers. 
	It would be appealing to viewers to be able to do the same as their celebrity idols through BookBackers: choose the books they'd like to see published and see whether they have a better eye than them for a successful book. 

Ten minutes isnt enough to give you all the details on how BookBackers would work: what happens when two publishers want to upload the same manuscript, for instance, or who administers the site, or how the BookBackers get their dividends. But a lot has been thought through and more details are available at bookbackers.co.uk. If youd like to talk to us about taking this idea forward as an industry, here are the details.  Thanks for listening.","","","","2008-05-14","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

OK. I don't speak German, so I don't really know what that means. I just thought it might mean 'little book'. Note to self: bilingual puns are tricky if you don't speak the language. Anyway, the little book in question is the paperback edition of Naomi Klein's <em>The Shock Doctrine</em> which is now out in affordable and portable paperback. It's a love story set against the backdrop of the French Revolution, told through the eyes of one of Marie Antoinette's ladies-in-waiting. Well, not really. I just thought if I said that people would be more likely to read it. It's really about less romantic things like how the world works. People insist on democracy, so if you want to start wars or steal billions you have to do it subtly. This book is about exactly how that sort of thing happens right under our noses. And when I become Emperor, I'll put it on the school syllabus and give tests afterward to make sure everyone reads it.

There's a <a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/in-depth/feature/58755-automatic-for-the-people.html"">little piece</a> in the latest Bookseller sort of written by me. I wrote the first draft, but it's changed a bit since then. Something like that always seems to happen and it's a weird thing being rewritten. I like to think that with a clear brief I'm not a bad writer. I wrote a book about retail strategy a while back and the global head of McKinsey was very complimentary about it. Stuart Rose (boss of M&S) liked it enough to give a quote for the cover. I've also had some success with fiction. I think you could find my novels without too much trouble in most European countries (including this one). So all in all, I don't tend to feel like I need someone to step in and fix my prose for me. A hint or two is all I need. So if you happen to see the article and you wonder why, instead of ridiculing phrases like <span style=""font-family: courier;"">'Publishers often engage with questions of finance...'</span> or <span style=""font-family: courier;"">'The clarity this affords is paramount;'</span> I seem to suddenly be embracing that sort of corporate silly-speak, the answer is that my words were given a smart new suit of clothes and a haircut after I finished with them.","I also would have baulked at humouring publishing technophobes to quite the extent I now appear to have done, but that's journalism for you. Just because I didn't <em>quite</em> say it and don't <em>entirely</em> stand by it doesn't mean it shouldn't be printed with my name on it. So why didn't I object? Because it's not a bad article, it's just not quite how I would have expressed myself. So I simply asked to share the byline with the author of so much of its content. And at least on the evidence of the <a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/in-depth/feature/58755-automatic-for-the-people.html"">online copy</a>, that seems to have been edited out as well.","","","","2008-05-16","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Here's an idea: buy up oil as soon as it becomes available and then sell it to other people at a profit. Sounds a bit farfetched, doesn't it. We're used to the idea of investment bubbles in most areas: bubbles being caused when buying and selling become more about profit than use. Which is to say, when people buy a house or a ton or copper not because they plan to use it, but because they plan to sell it again at an opportune moment. But somehow you don't expect people to do that with oil. You get the impression that it will be used up as quickly as it's available. But the ever excellent Jon Taplin, whose blog I find distinctly more-ish, sees just such a speculative environment. I'm glad to have stumbled upon his explanation, because the record profits of oil companies have had me baffled for a while. Usually, when the cost of your raw materials go up, your profits are squeezed. But not if the price rise is down to stockpiling and tactical selling. See <a href=""http://jtaplin.wordpress.com/2008/05/14/speculation-crude-oil/"">here</a> and <a href=""http://jtaplin.wordpress.com/2008/05/14/from-a-friend/"">here</a> for more.

Phew. Thank goodness. An episode of Doctor Who that didn't make me feel weary and frustrated. All really rather silly, but original, thank goodness. I've really felt the quality of Who slipping even further this season with the previous two stories so fumbling their denouements (ooh, matron) that I'm still not exactly sure what happened. <em>[There be spoilers ahead, yarrr!]</em>","The Sontaran exhaust gas that was sort of killing everyone, except it wasn't, but it would if it reached 80% concentration, except that it wasn't poison it was 'clone food', except not food because it turned you into a Sontaran, except we didn't see any sign of that. That's my best guess as to what that particular two episodes of running around was all about.

And then the Doctor's Daughter where the endless war had only been running for a week and yet no one remembered how it got started, even though the leader of the humans looked to be nearly sixty (and the machine was supposed to create 'mature' offspring, not middle-aged). And what all that had to do with a terraforming project escaped me. And why smashing the glass bubble stopped the war I didn't get. And why was the only person who didn't suddenly decide to stop the war the old guy and why - other than the inevitable demands of plot - did he need to shoot Jenny? So many question; so few answers.

Of course the same could, to some extent, be said of a story which had a giant shape-changing wasp getting angry, thus discovering its true nature and so having its brain imprinted with the plots of various novels currently being ruminated on by the person wearing the special necklace its father had left behind. Are we to believe that there's a lifeform out there which develops one personality for forty years and then uses jewellery to create another one from the uppermost thoughts of the wearer? I can't imagine that works out well very often. Or is particular common among aliens species as a path to maturity. But still, there was enough that did make sense, and enough that was original, entertaining, surprising and humorous to keep me happily distracted. Finally, an episode that I could award a hearty B- to. Well. At least a C+ then.

But that said, I have developed a worrying theory about the lowered quality of this and last season's storytelling. I think the production team actually think they're doing a good job. I think they've got into the mindset of 'the public will never know, it's all brilliant sleight of hand, look at what you can get away with'. I'm starting to worry that they think their sloppiness and lack of invention is actually brisk, efficient and economical television and not second-rate amateur theatricals. I exclude David Tennant from the preceding remarks, of course. Not only is he a fine actor, but he seems to be working so hard to bring charm, humour and a little gravitas to the proceedings that I'm worried he'll have a heart attack.","","","","2008-05-18","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","9"

So, how often are you reading a rather dense book - albeit a supposedly non-technical one - about developmental psychology & neuroanatomy and you come across something which sends a shiver down your spine? Em recently read a book about how babies' brains develop and what role interaction plays. It's called <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Love-Matters-Affection-Shapes/dp/1583918175/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1211199128&sr=8-1"">Why Love Matters</a> - <em>how affection shapes a baby's brain</em>, and it's by Sue Gerhardt. I suspect Em found it interesting from a practical point of view, whereas I think she probably passed it over to me for a more abstract appreciation of its themes.","Here is a typical sentence. <span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;"">""Probably the reason we cannot remember our early infancy is because the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and its links to the hippocampus have not fully developed at that time.""</span> Well, maybe that's a particularly chewy example. But it's not a romp. Although it is very interesting if you're either monstrously nerdy (<em>comme moi</em>) or a very well-read prospective mother (<em>comme La Em</em>). But then I got to a section about the behaviour of a girl, called Genie, who was locked in one room until she was thirteen, and beaten when she complained. She had never learned to speak and so her brain had clearly developed a very different set of connections from children who use words to assess and influence their environments. She was extremely good at communicating her needs non-verbally and one of the things she was always after were plastic objects, which seemed to fascinate her. One of the researchers who worked with her then tells a truly bizarre and spine-tingling story as follows: <span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;"">""One day we were walking - I think we were in Hollywood. I would act like an idiot, sing operatically, to get her to release some of that tension she always had. We reached the corner of this very busy intersection, and the light turned red, and we stopped. Suddenly I heard the sound - it's a sound you can't mistake - of a handbag being spilled. A woman in a car that had stopped at the intersection was emptying her handbag and she got out of the car and ran over and gave it to Genie and then ran back to the car. [It was a] plastic handbag.""</span> And that's the bit that gave me a shiver.","","","","2008-05-19","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Big day, yesterday - Andy and I went to the hospital in London to have our 20 week scan. And we found out the sex! It's a...","...Boy! Hooray! Well, of course I wasn't fussed either way, but it's very nice to know. His name is Rowan Michael Barnes, or will be in October. He can be a historian with a name like RM Barnes, or an artist with a name like Rowan, or a statesman or top publisher or author as Rowan Barnes, and when he's a teenager he can be called Ro which is sort of cool. I think I will nickname him Rowan Berry Boo Boo. And he will love me forever. 

It was a bit nerve wracking as we had to have three scans, since the lady couldn't find the stomach at first. Babies drink aminotic fluid and wee it out (then drink it again, gross) so we had to wait until his stomach filled up. Was all fine in the end, phew. 

But I was SO tired in the evening! I haven't felt that wiped out for ages. A sign of things to come, perhaps... still managed to clear my email and sign off a couple of cover proofs. I am invincible - but you knew that already.  

And last night, once we knew the sex, Andy and I did what all excited new and forthcoming parents do: registered the child's domain name. Er, right? Everyone does that, yes? Andy commented that in the old days you'd register your son's name at Eton once you knew the sex. I much prefer our way. <a href=""http://www.rowanbarnes.com"">www.rowanbarnes.com</a> currently points to Snowbooks' homepage, but I'll build a site eventually. 

Today amongst the paperwork and the bits and bobs I may, just may, glance at some baby clothes. It is quite shocking how gender stereotyping works in kids' clothes - boys are all sailors and combat trousrs, girls are all fairy princesses and frills. There's a site called <a href=""http://www.vertbaudet.co.uk"">Vertbaudet.co.uk</a> which gives you the option of buying for your little princess or for mummy's little soldier. For god's sake! I'm afraid it's cream and green for you, son. And no bloody guns. 

//update - oh, and by the way, this is not an invite to comment negatively on the name Rowan! If you don't like it, or have narky comments to make, do keep it to yourself. My tolerance for well-meaning advice is already at zero... //","","","","2008-05-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","7"

I've just written, and deleted, a long, self-absorbed, pathetic post about how poor I am and how I wish Snowbooks would make more money and how it's not fair that we have to work so hard for so little financial reward. I deleted it because it did its job - it made me realise that I was wallowing and not noticing all the excellent things I have. Writing is very good like that. It's a good tool to use in managing my temperament - one of the big Secrets of Getting Through Things.","Yes, things are tough; sales are as difficult as ever to achieve; people are demanding and sometimes a bit stupid; I have no money. But I could be well off, working for a large company, miserable as sin and having to commute to an office every day - and not be able to tell people what I think of them, not be able to make my own choices and not be building up the wealth (if not cash) of a company I'm proud of. I woke up this morning, feeling the weight of the world on my shoulders. A spot of cathartic blog posting and I'm ready to start the day. Shame you'll never get to read it as it was funny, in retrospect. And I'm mentioning it anyway because you should know that running a small business is hard, and gets me down from time to time, and I feel strongly that you should hear about the downs as well as the ups. I'm also mentioning it to reiterate the idea of how crucial it is to manage your temperament. 

Managing one's temperament is all about self-awareness - realising when you're feeling down, figuring out what the root cause of that is, asking yourself 'do I really want to be the sort of person who lets this sort of thing defeat her?', answering 'hell, no', taking a deep breath and starting again. It helps to have negative role models - people you'd rather die than be like, who crumble at the same sorts of things you're facing - whether that's tiredness, tough times at work, people being difficult or a shaky market. It helps to find tools to process your thoughts, rather than having everything bang around in your head - like writing, or phoning a friend. The most important thing, which I have to keep reminding myself to do, is to get a sense of perspective. It's good to have a day to wallow - but then some self-reflection is important to snap yourself out of it. 

What other Big Secrets of Getting Through Things are there? I think the main other one is being organised. I feel myself slipping out of control within a matter of hours if my structure breaks down. It doesn't matter how many things are on my plate, or how much there is to do, if all the tasks, plans, projects and ideas are written down, ordered, dated, filed, recorded, known about. My to do list at the moment has 54 separate things on it - some will take five minutes, others a week. But I know they'll get done, in a timely way, because I don't have to hold all 54 things in my head and worry about forgetting something. It frees my head up to do other things, like think, relax, manage my temperament.

When I sat down to write today's post, it was going to be a no-holds-barred, deliberately open and honest account of how miserable I feel today, how it was all too hard, whether it was all worth it. Funnily enough, I don't feel miserable at all now. One temperament, managed. Tick.","","","","2008-05-21","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","7"

"41673","","1","People like their favourite authors","Publish","true","<div class=""pic"" style=""width: 120px; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Little-Brother-Cory-Doctorow/dp/0765319853/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1211702785&sr=8-2""><img alt=""LittleBrother.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/LittleBrother.jpg"" width=""109"" height=""108"" /><p>Little Brother</p></a></div>

I imagine there are some highly sophisticated people out there who despise their favourite authors. They probably wouldn't use the term 'favourite' in fact. They might say that some of the work that they find most stimulating and intellectually satisfying is created by human beings who are not intrinsically likable and who might not be especially deserving of praise in other areas of their lives. But I suspect that's a minority attitude. My suspicion is that most people see their favourite authors a little like they see their favourite bands: as well as appreciation, there's a good helping of affection and a hint of awe in there too. It makes me wonder if authors who relied on voluntary donations would thrive or starve. I imagine Cory Doctorow thinks about that too. He has a <a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/"">new book out</a> and it's available in shops... and <a href=""http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/"">online for free</a>.","It's called Little Brother and I'm currently reading an electronic version. It took about three minutes from deciding to read it to starting at page one. I downloaded a copy for my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Reader"">Sony Reader</a>, which means I can take it all the places I would take a paperback (the Reader is actually slimmer than a paperback). Cory has a note at the beginning  of the book suggesting that if you enjoy reading it and want to pay some money for it then you should order a copy online and have it sent to one of a <a href=""http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/"">list of librarians</a> and schools who have requested a copy. He prefers this approach, compared with simply sending him a cash donation, because he wants his publishers to benefit - and he has a soft spot for Amazon too, so is happy to recommend them. It's a little clunky as a process (I had some difficulty even finding the list of potential recipients), but it's very interesting as a concept. The existing split of revenue for author, publisher and retailer is preserved, but it relies entirely on goodwill. I imagine no one who thinks he sucks as an author is likely to buy the book for a school.

What percentage of those who read the book for free will make a donation, do you suppose? And will the book reach a lot more people through being available online, without payment, in multiple electronic formats (there's even one you can read on your Texas Instruments calculator)? After all, those two considerations tend to cancel each other out. If the book reaches ten times as many people by being available to download, rave about and pass on to friends, that would somewhat offset the possibility that only one in a hundred readers will make a donation. (I'm making those numbers up, of course. I have no idea what the real fractions are.)

Now, at this particular moment in history, paper is still pretty popular. So there's an argument which suggests that even if no money is made from electronic versions of a book, online enthusiasm still makes sense as PR for the paper edition - even if it cannibalises a few sales of the paper edition. If one community (those who download it for free) are praising the book, then that enthusiasm may well seep through to the community of paper book readers. After all the two communities overlap in an intriguing way, because there is something of a link between enthusiasm and influence when it comes to the web. Active users of the internet tend to influence passive users. Or to put it another way: those who write blogs and who started doing so before it was so popular are more likely to have built up a readership and thus exert influence online than those who are more hesitant with technology and who have just started to  read a few blogs. So early adopters of an internet-friendly lifestyle are a good group to have on your side praising your work - and they're exactly the people most likely to own a Sony Reader or a Kindle and to download e-books.

Of course one still needs to consider 'friction'. That's a slightly silly strategy-consultants' term for the energy dissipated performing a transaction. If you can buy a book online for the same price as in a shop - and that means you save two pounds in bus fare and an hour of your day - then you might well choose to minimise your friction and buy online. (On the other hand, if you use terms like 'transactional friction' then the chances are that you don't travel by bus much or worry about the fare.) 

Cory's list of librarians seeking donations is a great idea as a one-off, but it's a little labour-intensive to use. You pick a name from the list, (and hope no one else is doing the same at that moment), you order the book from Amazon (or elsewhere) and have it sent as a gift to the beneficiary's address, then you e-mail a copy of the receipt to the lady who updates the beneficiaries' list online. There's room for streamlining there (and what techies call 'record locking' where you make sure you don't have two people unknowingly picking the same beneficiary at the same moment). But since this same process would be useful to lots of authors in the future, it makes sense to create a slicker mechanism for these structured donations either at the level of the publisher, the retailer or the industry itself - rather than have each author try to put something together. If, say, the <a href=""http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/homepage.php"">Book Depository</a> wanted to get their programmers working on a system, there's an opportunity there to do some pioneering work. Whether reading downloaded books ends up being 1% of the market or 95% of it, there's still going to need to be a method for voluntarily supporting the authors you love. It's what I've been thinking of as <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/05/otakunomics.html#more"">Otakunomics</a> and people like <a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/"">Seth Godin</a> have been <a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/files/musicbusinesslive.pdf"">writing about</a> for a while now. Building conduits for fans to support the people whose work they love is likely to be the next wave of development in industries like music, and quite possibly books. In other words, there's an opportunity there.","","","","2008-05-25","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Time to air some of my preconceptions. I think of most SnowBlog readers as being more sophisticated about literature than I am. You listen to more Radio 4 (in the evenings sometimes!) and you like more classical music than I do; you probably have complex opinions about the Dutch School and the Arts & Crafts movement. You can reel off the names of the Bloomsbury set but struggle with the cast of Eastenders. You'd have plenty to say when comparing the merits of Eliot and Dickens, and there are Booker prize winners that you genuinely enjoyed reading, no pretense or lying required. And none of you can write a decent computer program or see why you'd want to. Silly and fanciful stereotypes I know, but if I'm right, then you probably won't like <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Brother-Cory-Doctorow/dp/0765319853/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1211790173&sr=8-1"">Little Brother</a>, by Cory Doctorow. But I loved it.","It's set a year or two into the future, just to give it room to be fiction. It picks up a theme that we're all familiar with: how, over the last eight years, there's been more CCTV everywhere, more no-fly lists, extraordinary rendition, biometric passports, taking your shoes off and throwing away all liquids before you can fly, waterboarding, US scandals over domestic spying and illegal wiretaps, and constant calls for more security everywhere and less privacy anywhere - except if you're in charge, in which case everything you do seems to be classified. It's all about giving up our freedoms to protect them. 

<em>Little Brother</em> takes all of that one small and believable step further. We've all got used to the idea that if we do something suspicious at the wrong moment we could be in serious trouble, even if we've committed no crime. <em>Little Brother</em> follows a rather wholesome San Francisco teenager, called Marcus, who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when something really, really bad happens. The line between suspicion and guilt having become so blurred, he finds himself being treated like a terrorist. And when the authorities have finished abusing and threatening him - at least for the time being - Marcus realises that whoever all these paranoid and invasive rules are protecting, it's clearly not him - or anyone he cares about. For the rest of the book, he uses his inventive geekiness and that of his much persecuted friends to resist the security clampdown and to carve out a little privacy in a world that wants to read his e-mail, monitor his travel patterns and lock him up if he complains. 

Marcus is both more knowledgeable than most seventeen-year-olds and a little more wholesome - but not ridiculously so, and the story requires both of those traits. It needs to show that as a country flirts with the idea of becoming a police state, then sooner or later every type of person will get caught up in the security machine - not just angry young Arab men, but 'good kids' too, because tighter rules almost always tend to criminalise being a teenager. And Marcus needs to be wicked smart because the book is packed with fabulously subversive tips on how to beat security systems, locate surveillance cameras, communicate untraceably and figure out who to trust - which as one of the book's recurring themes suggests - should probably exclude anyone over twenty-five.

Clearly this book has an agenda and if you believe that only bad people have anything to fear from an incipient police state, you'll be annoyed by it. Personally, I thought it was marvellously entertaining: really interesting, really fun. Cory doesn't cheat too much: he has all the counter-arguments to his hero's views in there, some of which drive a wedge between him and his friends and family. And his hero, Marcus, finds time for other things besides intrigue: He meets a girl, and that relationship becomes just as much of a reason to read on as the threat that he'll be detained and perhaps 'disappeared' overseas.

The book is written with something of the YA (=Young Adult) audience in mind - though that didn't cause me any problems at all (draw your own conclusions over what that means). But I'd love to know what brainy mid-teens make of it - assuming you want to put anything so frankly seditious into their hands. Before handing it to them, you might wish to know that there's violence, some sex and lots of <em>information</em> which, if used to its full extent, could get you thrown in prison. But on the plus side, there's relatively little swearing, so buy a copy for a young person today. And then read it before handing it over.

<i>The book's technology: [contains spoilers]</i>
In the comments, Lee cites some critics who think the technology in the book is too convenient, or the bad guys too slow on the uptake, which amounts to weak plotting. There are nits I could pick with the book, but they don't really concern the technology.

For instance, in the book, a group of kids use a future version of the Xbox (the Xbox Universal) to communicate. They load a special version of Linux onto it, in place of the Microsoft-supplied software, and then use the ability of the boxes to link to each other wirelessly to form their own mini-internet which they call the Xnet. The Xnet also makes use of ordinary internet links, often links belonging to unsuspecting Xbox owners outside of the group. The Department of Homeland Security are slow to notice this. One criticism is that the DHS would surely notice an increase in encrypted traffic. This is actually a niggle brought up by the characters in the book, and their fix is to persuade a friend who runs a music site to encrypt downloads of songs as a way to create lots more encrypted traffic and thus hide the suspicious activity. First off, these are several thousand kids in a city of seven million. Secondly, lots of things use encryption already (banking, shopping, some e-mail). And thirdly, because they're often piggybacking off other people's internet connections it's going to spread out the evidence. It's not clear to me that the authorities would notice anything, but even if they did, the story deals with that problem promptly. And while its fix - happening to know someone who owns a music site - is convenient, there would have been lots of ways to achieve the same thing. If it hadn't been done with music it could have been done with file sharing or gaming, for instance. One could modify a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_%28protocol%29"">BitTorrent</a> network to hide a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmorpg"">VPN</a> for communicating. Or how about if they'd hosted their own <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmorpg"">MMORPG</a>, hacked to hide communications within the game transfers? We're talking about two or three thousand techno-literate kids, on the edge of Silicon Valley. It's not a stretch that they would have useful contacts in a game, website or bittorrent network.

There's also the question that the machines running the Xnet are Xbox Universals given away for free. Surely this is just a cute idea, rather than an important plot point. Cory saw that Xbox 360s actually cost rather more to make than their retail price and posited a future where a box is given away for free and the revenue made entirely on the games. But if that idea doesn't appeal, you don't need special Xboxes for the plot to work. You could use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livecd"">LiveCD</a> of a Linux distro on any PC that's not physically bugged. Cory could have had his kids check their PCs very carefully for physical bugs and then, say, boot <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoppix"">Knoppix</a> off flash drives and then hide the drives when they're not in use. Any version of Linux would do, provided the kids in the novel wrote a few extra scripts and tunneling protocols; ParanoidLinux is just a cute idea: having a version of Linux already in existence that paranoid people can use. In fact it's such a cute idea that there's a group at work coding it right now. So by the time the novel takes places, there almost certainly will be something called ParanoidLinux that works exactly like it's supposed to.

Similarly, if you don't think that the Xnet is plausible, then there are already mesh networks in existence, in places like Seattle and MIT's <a href=""http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/roofnet/doku.php"">roofnet</a>. You take a cheap wireless router and load new software on it (freely available for download right now). The routers link to each other automatically and form their own network. 

Another critic thinks the police would notice kids reprogramming the chips in people's toll passes and railcards. But in the novel, the kids use portable devices that reprogram nearby RFID chips automatically and from a distance (after all, the point of RFID is that it doesn't need physical contact). Doing so involves having the reprogrammer hidden in your bag and walking down the street; what's to spot? Whether the specific passes mentioned in the book really can be hacked with freely available equipment, I have no idea. But they could almost certainly be copied and cloned, as <a href=""http://www.smartcard.co.uk/mifare.html"">here</a> (the link discusses a method for cloning Oyster cards).

The point is that if any one technical twist in the book - or even all of them - for some reason seem wrong or bad or silly - an assessment I don't really understand or agree with - there are plenty of ways to achieve the same thing. Cory is an ex-Sys Admin and he had computer security consultants (one of whom writes an afterword for the book) read early drafts of the book. If the feedback had been 'this would never work' it would have been simple to make a few changes and to keep exactly the same plot but alter some of the technical details. To me, that means there isn't a problem with the technical plot points or their convenience.","","","","2008-05-26","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","12"

Hey, it's SnowBlog post 1000! Whoop! 

For post 500, I wrote about the genesis of Snowbooks. This time, here's a State of the Union - a full update on how things are going. Warning - <strong>mammoth </strong>post with many tangents. Get a nice big cup of coffee first.","I can't quite believe that it's nearly June 08. A glance out of the window supports my conviction that my calendar is broken - there's cloud to the ground and a decided nip in the air. Still, it does appear we are nearly half way through the year, and it's true to say that it's been a very good year so far on many fronts. We got our first major  book-related prize shortlisting, for Matthew de Abaitua's The Red Men for the Arthur C Clarke award. We've won a couple of industry awards too: Independent Trade Publisher of the Year and Innovation Nibbie, as well as being shortlisted for the Small Publisher Nibbie. I had a mild sense that it was a long time since we'd won something - the last prize we won was in 2006, and you can't keep rolling that story out in perpetuity - so it was a good feeling to start the clock again in 2008. 

On the editorial side, I think we're much more confident in our publishing. That probably comes from having a smaller team with more aligned views of what's good. Whilst we don't have a fixed editorial strategy, our focus on horror and fantasy - werewolves, zombies, vampires and apocalyptic horsemen - has been a result of our personal taste and has also been a shrewd commercial move, turns out. Certainly compared to last year, when we had a focus on thrillers and edgy fiction, our frontlist sales on our horror are much stronger. Historical fiction is also an area that has done well, and Sarah Bower's latest The Book of Love has got off to a fine start. And four colour non fiction is a fabulous idea - pretty much all our colour books pay their way and then keep contributing every month. Where we've struggled more is on the general commercial fiction. Two books that we adore, have designed really well (judging from people's feedback, not just my own ego) and have done a good sales job on have underperformed against expectations and compared to what we'll call the genre fiction. Is it that the general fiction market is so competitive? Is it that they've actually performed as well as they would with a large publisher, and general fiction really needs a prize shortlisting to sell in quantity? Are we just spoilt because horror and fantasy are so much more lively? As with much in publishing and selling books, who knows. 

I mentioned that we don't have an editorial strategy. Sure, it's not written down or set in stone, but we talk about what sort of books we like, what we're interested in publishing and what we think will do well. Overall, we unashamedly aim to publish books that we think we can sell, and we don't feel bad turning books down if we think the reverse -we'd be doing no author a favour if we couldn't sell his book (although sometimes I do get the sense that some authors aren't as passionate as we are about the actual 'selling books' bit and are more interested in the concept of being published.) One of the things I like the most is when we get a book submitted to us which has pretty much none of the features we may have discussed in our editorial chats. The zombies, for instance - we didn't make any plan at all to publish zombies, but David Wellington's books are so astonishingly good, so captivating and just so enjoyable, that we signed a three book deal - something we'd not considered a possibility before. Ditto a book we've just signed for 2009 called The J-word - a wonderful piece of commercial fiction about Jewish identity. I'm not Jewish, and neither is Anna nor Rob, and I have to say I've not really stopped to think very hard about Jewish identity. This book utterly drew me in to an area that I had no real interest in. If we had to have any editorial strategy, it would be this - a book has to be so good that we may never have considered publishing something like it before we read it. (That is not carte blanche to submit your poetry/illustrated kid's book/spiritual self help/crappy overwritten YA fantasy stuffed full of elves, by the way.)

Regarding the process of sales, we've teamed up with Allison and Busby who now manage all our sales, which is working out very well. Certainly I'm never satisfied, and we always need to sell more books, but the adminstrative load they've taken from me is worth their x% on its own. The really annoying thing about selling is that it's very difficult to automate it (if you've been reading the SnowBlog for any amount of time you can imagine how much that rankles). Every retailer has a different timescale for buying and a different way of receiving bibliographic data. Maybe one day in the future they'll all accept ONIX feeds, but at the moment they use a mixture of CSV files from Nielsen (who collect my ONIX data then wrangle/mangle it into the right form for each customer - not actually their fault if customers insist on using the same method they used 5 years ago), excel spreadsheets with drop down menus (the curse of the automater) and email. And of course, there's the chasing. It's not enough to send off the data, on time - you have to endlessly chase. I find that trying, but the lasses at A&B are masters of it.    

Cash has always been something I've kept a very close eye on, and over the last half year we've also worked really hard to add profit to that focus. (Less of the corp-speak - Rob has gone on and on and on and on at me to sort my act out and do some decent reporting and has sat with me and written code and access queries and has reassured me and kept me going and talked me through the pain of just sitting down and tackling it until - finally - it's done, and useful.) Other small publishers reading this - and probably large ones, too - will know that it's quite difficult, really, to calculate exactly how profitable a title is, and as our list grows if that's a manual calculation then it becomes a huge burden to keep tabs on each title's performance. So now we have an all singing, all dancing MS Access database that automatically grabs the latest reports from our distributor LBS, processes them into a useful file and runs a bunch of queries over them, so we can run reports at a title and weekly level that give our profit. It's not quite as simple as that, actually: here's what we report on for each title, if you care: 

<em>* Number of copies shipped
* Net receipts (how much money we get from the retailer for those copies, after discount)
* Other costs related to the title - like the cost of artwork, if there was any
* Royalty
* Cost of sales (how much it cost to print the copies shipped - not the full print run price, the price per unit, which needs to be averaged out across multiple print runs)
* Take those costs from the net receipts and you get the gross contribution - the margin from the book sales that we can put towards covering non-book-specific costs like payroll, office costs, and other overheads. 
* Then we report what our returns volume and value has been for that title, and from that figure out how much it's cost us to pulp or process the returns. Remember, it's not as simple as the retailer just asking for a credit; LBS charge us to process returns and we have to take a hit to the balance sheet on stock that can't be sold again. 
* That gives us our net contribution after returns. 
* We also look at our stock position - what the value of stock is in the warehouse, and what the value is on the balance sheet.</em>

So that's how we manage our finances. Regarding the actual state of them, well as I've said in the past we have no external debt, no equity and the associated shareholders to keep happy, or otherwise, no bank debt, no overdraft, no loans - in other words, no reliance on outside lines of credit to keep us secure. That's a nice place to be, especially as banks are getting twitchier at the moment. But I do moan about cash flow a lot. I think partly it's because I like to have a large, twenty thousand pound minimum buffer to rely on in case weirdness happens. Sadly LBS find it near impossible to forecast how much money we are going to receive in from month to month, so I don't think I'm being too paranoid and control freaky about needing a buffer, as some months I can be expecting 15,000, say, and receive nothing. Those months are fun to manage, although we haven't had one of those so far this year. 

My overall sense of this year is that we have really improved and stabilised our financial performance compared to last year, thank god. As we've said before, the fallout from Christmas 2006 resulted in a very tumultuous 2007, but from October 2007 onwards things have been a lot smoother. Our Christmas strategy of fewer upfront sales - with the threat of high returns - has resulted in a really pleasing, low returns rate, which I think I can safely say now we're nearly in June (though never say never - I got returns from May 2006 the other day from one major retailer). Our costs are much lower, too - 30% down - having shed a couple of members of staff but upped the amount of automation we do, as well as switching 100% of our print to Haynes the printers, a magnificent printer with whom we have a great relationship and who don't shaft us on price like our previous printers appeared to do. Our main aim is to sell, sell, sell. On high sale titles, the metrics sort themselves out: we enjoy a high print cost to sales multiple, a high average sale price and a low returns rate on all our titles which sell over 10,000 copies. This is not about increasing the number of titles we do. It is about getting more titles onto promotion, in more stores, and achieving higher sell throughs. 

Speaking of key metrics, this is how our titles published in FY2007-8 have performed (figures drawn from the TPS report - Trading Performance of Snowbooks - which I've finally sorted out the cover sheet for. Thanks for the memo, Rob): 

	Average Sale per unit 2.26 
	Average margin per unit 0.88 
	Returns: 20% 
	Stock value: 35k 
	Sales/print multiple: 1.9x

Do share your own metrics in the comments if you want to get a benchmarking thing going. 

We're hardly rolling in money - our salaries and drawings are still pitiful, but growing, at least, as we have each had a mini pay rise recently - which can get me down from time to time. But five years in we have a stable business that is successful on many fronts, and most importantly we're proud of it. Just a bit more money would be nice, but we have achieved what we once thought was impossible - escaping from the corporate world, working for ourselves on our own terms, without having to sell out. That is priceless.","","","","2008-05-28","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","5"

Pesky climate. It's been raining for most of the last week. It's really hit a kind of determined, marathon form of precipitation that just keeps steadily dumping water from the sky. Four or five hours back puddles and pools started to form in my garden. A couple of hours ago, the dip outside my front door filled up and the water started to well up inside my house. Like it did last summer... for the first time anyone could remember (and it's an old building). I did what I did last time - which apparently you're not really allowed to do - which is to pop the inspection hatch on the sewer and set up some lengths of hosepipe to siphon water out of the little lagoon in front of my house and into the drains. The yicky part is sucking on the hosepipe to get the water flowing. It's bad enough sucking up rainwater (and that's really all it is), but this time there was a dead mouse floating in the puddle - half de-composed - where next door's cat had left it. So I've been gargling with dead mouse water. Anyone fancy a snog?","","","","","2008-05-28","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

I sort of feel this flap over fuel prices exposes our real state of preparedness - both mentally and in practical terms - when it comes to averting climate change. Of course, we're going to wean ourselves off fossil fuels in time to avert a global catastrophe. Bio-engineering technologies will save us. And Britain's green revolution is underway. Just don't for a second threaten our ability to burn at least as much fossil fuel as we did last year. Any risk of us having to use less petrol and suddenly it's pleading and threats to OPEC and talk of cutting fuel duties. I understand that people are suffering, but we knew this was coming. Is the plan really to save our civilisation by using up all the fossil fuel as quickly as possible?","","","","","2008-05-29","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

In my <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/05/post_1000.html"">State of the Union</a> post, #1000, I provided some of Snowbooks' key performance metrics. Here they are again if you missed them: 

 Average Sale per unit 2.26 
 Average margin per unit 0.88 
 Returns: 20% 
 Stock value: 35k 
 Sales/print multiple: 1.9x

An anonymous commenter from a business books publisher provided their metrics too: 

 Average Sale per unit 11.17
 Average margin per unit 5.22. 
 Returns: 6% 
 Stock value: 48k 
 Sales/print multiple: 2.32x

Which is utterly fascinating. Please, do post your own here, anonymously is fine (use my email address when you're posting your comment if you like - emma at snowbooks.com.) I think this would be really useful for people to see, and might provide us all with some useful insight. 

I've provided more info on how to calculate these numbers below the cut.","Average Sale per unit 

Total value sales (what you get from customers) for the last 12 months 
divided by
Total volume sales (how many units you've sold)

 Average margin per unit 

Total margin (which is sales, minus print cost for those sales, minus other direct costs, minus royalties)
divided by
Total volume sales. 

 Returns
Either 
Gross sales minus net sales
divided by
Gross sales
multiplied by 100 to express as a %

Or 
Total returns (if you have that data)
divided by
Gross sales
multiplied by 100 to express as a %

 Stock value
a) Calculate your average cost per unit: 
Total units printed across all print runs for each title
divided by
Total invoiced print bills for each title (add up the invoice values). 

b) Multiply this average cost per unit by your total stock on hand.

I have just finished typesetting a particular four colour fully illustrated book that has taken a full month of working time, spread over 6 months. The author doesn't have a computer and - and I honestly thought this breed had died out - is proud of the fact. I think that explains in large part why it's been such an eye-wateringly difficult project. In truth, I'm glad to see the back of it.  

I've moved on immediately to the next project - another four colour book. The author has delivered the manuscript in a Word document, and has used paragraph and character styles. He's used consistent notation to mark where images should go. I reckon I'll have the basic layout done by this afternoon, ready for the (clearly labelled and catalogued) images to drop in. 

Guess which book I'm going to do a better job of marketing? The one I can't bear to look at any more or the one whose author has made it a joy to work on? Prospective authors: making other people's lives easier matters.","","","","","2008-05-30","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","6"

Last time I bought a really small laptop it was about four years ago and it cost nearly 2000. That seems an unimaginable amount to spend now, not just because I'm poorer these days. Last week I bought the smallest and <a href=""http://www.misco.co.uk/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=312047&CatId=2944"">most beautiful laptop</a> I've ever owned, and it cost 300 (ex. VAT.). It's got a keyboard that's over 90% of full-sized, so I can touch-type without a hitch. In fact it's probably the silkiest keyboard I've ever used. It's got a bright and beady little display that crams some ridiculous resolution onto its 9"" screen.

Until a year ago, tiny laptops commanded a really high-end price ; you can now buy one for under 300.

Now <em>that's</em> what I'm talking about. A questionable but very fruitful premise executed with ability, style, humour and intelligence - not to mention a gift for tension - so that one finds oneself inevitably shifting towards the edge of one's seat. <i>[contains spoilers]</i>","I usually dread two-part episodes. Even some of my favourite writing teams fumble the pacing when they have to couple two sets of three acts together into a dramatic whole. But unless Steven Moffat has saved the worst to last, he's off to a fantastic start. Doesn't it just hit you how much difference a good script makes? The production team still have the same strengths and weaknesses, but suddenly they appear to be firing on all cylinders (except for whoever filmed the faces on the Node statues: when faking a face, you shouldn't be able to point out exactly which bits are latex).

On Who Confidential, poor, not very bright Phil Collinson talks about how we're all a bit afraid of libraries because they're, dunno, unsettling or something. Incorrect, Phil. That's just you. It's fear of the dark that's universal; we like libraries. And Russell T. was gushing about how exciting a Steven Moffat episode is because... well the list went on and on, but the executive summary is that they have every one of the important elements of good television, most in abundance. The well-intentioned, but slightly bumbling team were more or less the same group who've been dropping the ball each week, but now with a Moffat script to work on, they seem to have suddenly pulled themselves together. Maybe some of it is courtesy of director Euros Lynn, who has perhaps presided over fewer disasters than, say, Graeme Harper or Alice Troughton. But then he really doesn't come across as a genius. He also made <em>Fear Her</em>, which rather underwhelmed me. With any luck, it's all down to the Moffat Effect. Even the music cues seemed better this week. Once Steven Moffat is sitting in the big chair for the next proper season of Who, do I dare to hope that it's like this every week?

If I had to nitpick, and I can very rarely resist, I might have hoped a fellow who'd been time-travelling for nine hundred years would be used to the idea of convoluted time-lines. The Doctor seemed a bit slow on the uptake. River Song knows him well, but he hasn't met her yet - I felt we'd got that long before the Doctor started to grasp it. But that's not to detract: it's clearly very important to the plot that we get it, so Mr Moffat has perhaps decided to hit us over the head with it a couple of times just to be sure. I'm feeling in an airy and generous mood, and therefore let him off unconditionally.

I have my fingers crossed for next week. And, seriously, if any of you know Steven Moffat - maybe you're married to him, or he owes you a lot of money - please get in touch. He might not know it yet, but he'd love to have me write a script or two for him. (Ooh, plus I really must stop slating the very team I'd love to work with.)","","","","2008-06-01","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

Always missing book development deadlines? Not even aware that there was a deadline in the first place? Why, you need SnoTT: the Snowbooks Tracker Tool!","<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/tracker.xlsm"">Download it here.</a> You'll need Office 2007 (or at least, Excel 2007) and you'll need to enable macros. (Don't worry, the last 5 years have not been an elaborate scam to lull you into a false sense of security to get you to download a virus-ridden .xls file containing macros.) Macro enabled workbooks default to save as a zip file, which is not what you want, so save it instead as a .xslm file, file type 'all files'. Enter your own bibliographic data (title, pub date), and your own schedule and click on the buttons to see which tasks are due this week, next week, last week and all future and past tasks. Presto! Organisation at your fingertips.

You should really get in touch: we charge 595 per cover, all in, for paperback and hardback, including finishes (spot UV, embossing, foiling etc) and printer ready PDFs, inclusive of any original or licensed artwork. Once you've paid, there are no ongoing royalties or anything - we'll send you the layered .psd files to do with as you please. And we'll keep tweaking until it's right. 

I have been approached by lots of external designers wanting to pitch for Snowbooks covers, and so I know that our prices are definitely a bargain. No, we don't charge less just because you're tiny. The cover is the greatest selling tool you have, and 595 is a small investment to get it right.

I've just received in a payment from our distributor for 18,000, when I was expecting anything from zero to, well, pick a number. Now that is most welcome (and a rather huge relief as I was starting to panic about July cash flow - hence the reminder about the cover design services we provide, below!) More windfalls like that, please, universe. 

Does anyone else, by the way, have tremendous trouble forecasting how much cash is going to come into the business? It's weird because our US distributors forecast it to the cent, four months in advance, but in the UK I pretty much have to wait until I see what arrives in the bank. Even when we ask them to manually calculate a forecast, it always varies. Our distributor says it's for a number of reasons: one is that customers may pay late, or have invoice queries (and since our invoices are batched with other publishers, there can be a lot of these). There's also a reserve on our account which varies by thousands each month. Each month, the distributor has a shortfall of collections for reasons ranging from invoice queries to non-payments, and allocates that difference between what is owed and what is collected by looking at the returns profile for each publisher. So last month I had a reserve of more than 16,000; this month it's 10,000. It's a hell of a lot of money, that's owed to us, sitting in a place other than our bank account. Another reason for the discrepancy between forecast and payment is that we're invoiced in a month for the cost of distributing the sales of that month, but only receive the money a matter of months later since we provide credit payment terms, and as it's a percentage you don't know what you'll be invoiced until the sales are in. 

It would save a lot of hyperventilating on my part if I could get cash receipt forecasts nailed down. Any tips?","","","","","2008-06-04","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

In a previous life, I used to think about things like out-sourcing and who should or shouldn't risk it, and under what circumstances. Em's been telling me about her difficulties in reasoning with BT about the provision of a phone line when she moves to her new home. If you think of customer service as the process of nipping customer dissatisfaction in the bud, then naturally you'd keep it pretty close to your core business and out-sourcing would be far from your thoughts (think perhaps of Zen Internet and their remarkable help desk). If, on the other end, you view customer interaction as a source of complaints which need to be deflected, without making the situation too much worse, then you might well hand the whole thing over to a call centre in Mumbai. 

Now, you might say that grumbling about having to talk to Indians is racist, but I think perhaps it's the opposite.","Say BT let you down and you're fuming mad about it. What do BT do next? Do they let you talk to someone in authority? Or possibly the person responsible for the screw-up, so that you can resolve the matter? No, they route your call to a very polite Indian gentleman, who you suspect is getting a pittance for stepping in as BT's punching bag. And considering that English is not his first language, you really don't want to be the one complaining about what is probably a remarkably fluent grasp of English - albeit not up to the task of following the ins and outs of line provision or scheduling problems with move orders. 

Take that approach a few steps further and every time BT make a mistake they'll be offering you the choice of a kitten to punch in the face to relieve your stress, or a little old lady in her nineties, with severe arthritis, to do your housework for a week. When we have a bone to pick with BT, most of us don't want to be insulting the language skills of a low-paid worker halfway round the world - and perhaps hastening the point at which they lose their job and income; what we actually want is someone to sort out our phone service. Hiding behind polite, helpful, but ultimately powerless Indians is not my idea of good customer service. In fact it almost seems to be cynically relying on our reluctance to appear racist in order to simultaneously ignore our grievances and confound our agitation over the fact. 

Now who do you suppose one phones at BT to complain about institutional racism? And does it involve the call being routed overseas?","","","","2008-06-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

I haven't been to the office for about three weeks. A combination of clutch problems on our car, resulting in a lot of time spent in the garage, and a deep seated sense of how much I'm over London has kept me in the countryside. However, today I am, in fact, in the London office - which is presumably why the connectivity gods have conspired to make our server go a bit funny.

A few years ago I was one of the early members of a book group. In fact I know exactly how long ago it was because last night was the five-year anniversary. My pal C&eacute;line compiled the list of what had been read to date (mostly after I dropped out) and it was generally agreed that the total topped a hundred titles. What was interesting was how little agreement there was on whether a particular title was a hit or a waste of time. There was only one book that everyone seemed to have got a kick out of: <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sacred-Hunger-Barry-Unsworth/dp/0140119930/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212766058&sr=8-1"">Sacred Hunger</a>. So thats a 1% hit rate when it comes to crowd-pleasers.","What was also interesting was the hit rate for successes for any particular individual. After a bit of thought, and a look back at the list, it was generally agreed that you couldnt expect to enjoy more than about two in every five titles. Thats pretty damning considering each title was enthusiastically suggested by someone, and normally seconded. There were heaps of Booker and Orange prize-winners in there. There were tons of famous and trendy literary authors too. Several of the participants work in publishing, so consistently there was an informed and thoughtful selection process. I noticed only one populist title: The Da Vinci Code  which provoked one of the best debates, apparently, because everyone hated it so passionately and wanted to air their criticisms. Maybe its just the nature of the beast, but it seems a shame that in the Twenty-First Century we still know so little about how to match a book to a reader, and the average book, no matter how lauded will fail to win over even the majority of those who are reasonably keen to read it. I doubt the donut industry could survive on those ratios.","","","","2008-06-06","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

I'm a bit behind the curve here, but wanted to draw your attention if you hadn't seen it in every blog, paper, and place of news: publishers are pushing on with proposing age banding on kid's books. My view is similar to that of many - it's a foolish, simplistic idea, which will stifle a love of reading and is a symptom of the nanny state. Do take a mo to subscribe to the petition at <a href=""http://www.notoagebanding.org"">www.notoagebanding.org</a>.","<a href=""http://www.fidrabooks.co.uk/blog/?p=249"">Vanessa </a>has a good write up of the issues, and some good links. Aside from my common-sense reaction that this is a stupid, limiting idea, one of the aspects I find most disturbing is the market research that underpins this move. 

Market research can be so elegant, so sophisticated - and so dangerous if misused. Out of interest,<a href=""http://www.acacia-avenue.com/""> the company </a>who ran the research promise to 'use no business jargon or so called TM processes', although I filled my bingo card in a few minutes' browsing (noteworthy examples include 'inter-dependent strands', 'language leaks'; oh, and they 'give ... consumers... a tangible voice inside organisations... which in turn creates a platform for more effective strategic decision-making.' Catchy.) Anyway, sniping aside, the first rule of market research is that it should never be used as a way to force a decision through. It's a data point - not tablets of stone. Methodologies are *never* foolproof. There is always some degree of leading the witness. I haven't seen the full methodology but if the overwhelming result was that age ranging is a good thing, then there will have been a question on the questionnaire or in the interview raising the subject of age ranging - respondents won't just have magicked the idea up, individually. So once the idea is in people's heads, they just have to say whether it would be a good or a bad thing. If the question is pitched just so - 'If a book was stickered to indicate which age group it was suitable for, would that make your purchase decision easier?' for instance - chances are people will tick the box without stopping to think about whether a 7 year old will be mortified at reading a book marked as suitable for a 5 year old. I have witnessed countless reports being prepared to act as some pseudo-science - often from a statistically insignificant sample size - to support an idea a company's board has already decided upon. I bet this is no different.  

Anyway. Go sign up. You'll be amongst excellent company - look at the list of <a href=""http://www.notoagebanding.org/index.php?supporters"">people who've already signed</a>.","","","","2008-06-09","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

Remember what I said about the book group I used to belong to having such divergent views about the books they liked? I was also glancing at some reviews for the recent Doctor Who two-parter that I liked so much and I was surprised to find there were people who weren't thrilled with it. And these weren't obviously crazy people either.

I know books and stories are complicated things and people are too, so it's inevitable that no two people will be alike, but I'm constantly surprised at just how much one person's black is another person's white.  What I'm wondering is how many broad categories of reader there are. Ignoring small differences and pet peeves, might readers fall into three basic types or maybe seven or thirty? Or are we spread out across infinite axes and there are no groups at all. I can't help think that if we could draw out everyone's tastes as dots in a 3D graph, we'd see clusters - maybe not tight little clumps of identical views - but still, there'd be discernible groups, maybe just three or four of them. Then we could name them and label books accordingly. You might still love things in other categories, but they wouldn't be, at their core, quite 'you'.","","","","","2008-06-13","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

I might have shared this with you before, good webfolk, but I thought it worth mentioning again. If you glance at an economics books you'll see the concept of 'utility'. Utility is sort of the benefit a person gets from something expressed as a sum of money. If an ice cream buys you five pounds of happiness, but only costs two pounds then it's a bargain. It's a slightly weird concept, but you can think of it the other way round: once you know what an ice cream tastes like you can ask yourself what's the maximum amount you'd ever spend on one. That's its utility to you. Obviously it will vary from person to person. Now, ideally one would set the price of, say, a book equal to its utility for each individual. Any less and you're giving it away, any more and you'll lose the sale. But how to do that?","A different facet of the same question presents itself when you think about how (to follow on from a comment on my <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/06/divergence.html"">last post</a>) the publishing industry makes no attempt to work out which book sales resulted in happy customers and which left the reader feeling ripped off. The answer: read the book while you're inside a functional imager like an MRI* machine. The price you pay will be based on how much pleasure the machine records you experiencing as you turn the pages. If it was a dud, you get it for free. But make sure you've got your cheque book handy if it's one of those real life-changing riproaring classics. 

And hopefully, in time, the imaging equipment can made to fit inside the kind of gentleman's smoking cap most of us typically wear when reading. Chin, chin.

2) Sodding, useless BT have failed thus far to connect our new phone line. Without a phone line, I can't set up the ADSL line. Without an ADSL line, I can't access the internets.

Well, I wasn't bored while watching 'Midnight'. But I can't see myself ever sitting down and wanting to watch that episode a second time. And you have to ask yourself how Russell T. Davies is feeling at the moment. [<i>Contains spoilers</i>]","The Doctor is first ganged up on and then rendered helpless. I'd assumed that the alien was influencing everyone's minds, in order to make them all behave so abominably, but in Who Confidential RTD explains that really, human nature in those situations is probably just like that. And that the secret weapon which stops the Doctor's voice of reason getting things back on an even keel is simple mockery. It makes reason seem like posturing and glib humour seem insufferably arrogant. Interesting.

If RTD were making a political point about fear bringing out the worst in us, might he not also have shown us what the alternative was? And hinted at how we could combat corrosive fear? But he explains that the descent into despair that we watch is simply what humans are like and even the Doctor can't cure that. The solution is not a changed viewpoint, a resurgence of empathy, or even reverence for thinking things through: it's solitary self-sacrifice by the one who got the ball rolling with all the hatred. Guilt and a sense of duty are all that prevent tourists becoming a lynch mob in the space of two hours. What sort of writer serves us up a parable about the viciousness of human nature on tea-time TV without even a hint that we can be redeemed? The murderous mob aren't won over, they're merely thwarted. 

It was gripping television, but I think RTD might have left his departure a little late. 'Humans are vicious under pressure and no one can save us from that' is not an episode premise dreamt up by a happy man. I tend to think it's not even true either. The exultant Doctor of last week, taking his first steps towards an even more legendary future, was really cut down to size this week. I think once you want to write an episode mocking and abusing your central character until he's fragile and fearful, while drumming it into people's heads that all humans do is bicker and turn on you, it's time to get out of the office for a while and maybe go for a nice walk in the countryside with a few friends. 

P.S. Strange that they would use the novel device of endless repetition to scare us in the Library. And then use repetition differently this week to freak us out and depress us. I can't help but think spacing those original ideas out a bit would have been a good idea.","","","","2008-06-15","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I was just about to step away from the blog when I noticed this wing&eacute;d thing excavating a troublingly deep hole in the Cotswold stone wall near my window (it belongs to my kindly neighbours). Of course before I could photograph it I had to swap lenses. I have a macro lens and a telephoto, i.e. one for close, one for distance. And every single time I want to take a photo I have to swap them over. In this case I had barely done so when the bird flew away so I didn't have time to get a sharper shot. There's now a single lens for my Nikon D40 that combines the macro with the telephoto. If I ever have enough money sitting around doing nothing to buy one I'll seriously consider it. It would double the usefulness of my camera.

Poor Em; she's having to live like folk did back in the Eighties, or maybe the early Nineties. No home internet connection. We've talked on the phone a few times and it's absolutely extraordinary how often some conversational topic gets derailed because there can be no checking, or looking up or sharing or keeping up with things if there's no internet. I mean there could be, but it would hard work. For instance, I bet teletext still carries perfectly good weather-on-demand pages - no tedious waiting for the next major news bulletin - just some tedious waiting around for lots of ugly squares to assemble themselves on your TV screen. Plus I'm sure we could hook up a fax to exchange book covers and other images if there's not enough time to let the postman do it. And, I imagine 35-volume encyclopedia sets have really come down in price for anyone who doesn't have access to Wikipedia and isn't fussed about anything that happened recently. 

But in some ways it's a return to a simpler time. A simpler time when half our long-distance interactions with others and the world at large were either difficult, impossible or undreamt of. Fingers crossed that Em can hold out until the right wires get hooked up.

Hello, hello! I have a connection again! Hello! I NEVER want to go through that again. Over 48 hours of complete enforced separation from my beautiful internets. It's Tuesday night, and since Sunday I have not: 

- read any email
- read the paper
- blogged
- read blogs
- been able to amend my online to do list 
- printed anything (I couldn't download the drivers to set up the printer) 
- looked stuff up

Think of the knowledge I won't have because of this awful hiatus. Thank heavens for Zen internet and their mighty ADSL service who got me online despite the best efforts of BT to balls things up (who I had to pay an extra 100 for the pleasure of bypassing their cock-up). Despite existing in the awful void I have, however, got frighteningly up to date with all my paperwork, which was about the only task I could do offline. 

I had 350 emails, but only 50 of those are important. So I'll be tackling them and their associated tasks first thing! Thanks for your patience, if you've been waiting for me! And thanks to Rob for coming over to my new house and setting up the server, ADSL filter (jacked into the master socket to eke a few more mbps out) and wireless network in record time. Clever, kind Rob. 

Oh, and by the way? Even though the exchange is 5 miles away, this connection is about the fastest I've ever had. 

Lots of pictures of new house and tales of moving will follow. Summary: it's all done, everything's unpacked, the artichokes and rhubarb are ready for picking and I'm in heaven. Gorgeous, silent countryside; fast internets; 3 minutes from the motorway; 13 minutes from the train station then a 55 minute journey to Marylebone; baby baking nicely; happy cats; perfect husband; idyllic cottage; business going well (except for a stupid returns request which I'm just not going to think about until tomorrow) - life is pretty perfect for me at the moment.

What Em is referring to is the sort of thing you see in weekly trading meetings at the big retailers. Imagine the buyers gathered together with a few key representatives of other functions and someone, maybe the commercial director, hauling everyone over the coals and scrutinising the previous week's trading performance. What you see a lot is bad sales being attributed to the weather. Too hot, too cold, too grey, too wet. What you never, ever see - not once ever - is someone responding to <em>good</em> sales by saying ""It's not really me; it's the weather: it's better than expected."" (Weather is never the reason for good sales even when discussing year-on-year performance in a situation where last year's poor sales were blamed on the weather.) Can you trust someone who blames bad weather if they never offer a share of the credit to an unseasonably fine spell?","","","","2008-06-19","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Not sure about '<a href=""http://airminded.org/2007/05/25/the-movie-that-time-forgot/"">Zeppelin v Pterodactyls</a>' as a movie concept, but Zeppelins on their own strikes me as a sound idea. I keep waiting for airships to make their inevitable and magnificent return. Picture a helium-filled Zeppelin, built using carbon fibre and up-to-the-second cleverness. Its skin would form one giant solar panel; its propulsion would be electric impeller engines. Just like the Zeppelins of old it would operate like a luxury cruise-liner of the skies: quiet, safe, comfortable. I can't quite decide whether to run them at a gentle hundred-mile-an-hour canter, so that the trip from London to New York takes a day and a half. Or slow them right down, and have them cruise four or five thousand feet above the waves at a sedate 35mph. That makes the Atlantic crossing a four day event, but you'd be able to walk around the promenade deck and even watch the dolphins through the telescopes on the rear sun terrace.

But selling arms to the world is one of Britain's biggest industries. It doesn't get discussed on the evening news in the same way we might hear about the export of British music or fashion, but arms dealing is one of the main things Britain offers the world. And I'm not even sure we're that good at it. 

When I hear of another Chinook crashing or how Nimrods haven't been safe to fly for years I wonder whether that's better or worse than selling weapons that work. Anyway, since our last PM shut down an investigation into the gargantuan bribes our weapons companies will offer clients, we've been able to go ahead and ship another massive consignment of armaments to one of the most repressive and undemocratic regimes on the planet: Saudi Arabia. And never forget, Osama Bin Laden was a Saudi, as were all but one of the 911 hijackers. I don't say that because I think we should tar all Saudis with the same brush, it's just that when you look at how the actions of a few Arabs seem to have caused the world to look upon all Arabs with hostility and suspicion, it's peculiar that it's Iraqis, Palestinians, Syrians and even the non-Arabs of Iran that suffer the PR fallout; Saudi continues to be a valued customer for our 'defence' industry. And the exciting news is that currently we're the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/21/armstrade.saudiarabia"">biggest arms dealer</a> in the world. We might be falling behind with our Green leadership, but at least we're busy selling fighter planes to an unelected monarchy of religious fundamentalists who don't believe in democracy, women's rights or free speech.","","","","2008-06-21","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Just in case any of you didn't realise what a nerd I am, let me correct your misconception. I'm currently reading a book about how Microsoft's previous game console, the Xbox, was hacked in the early part of this decade. Games consoles have to be set up so that you can't just make a copy of a game rather than buying your own, for obvious reasons. In fact, most of the revenue comes from selling the games rather than the console. And if the console needs to be running validation checks then you obviously have to make it secure from hackers, otherwise they might just turn off the piece of code that does the checking. What's interesting is to look at the struggle going on between the hacker community and the Microsoft engineers. You might think that the professionals, with their engineering degrees, big budgets and well-equipped labs would have the upper hand, but the internet seems to have done something rather impressive to all sorts of communities, hackers included.","In theory, the internet is one big community. Anyone can talk to anyone else - send them an e-mail, post a comment for others to read, set up a blog visible to all-comers. After all the physical wires underlying the web connect everyone to everyone else. But in practice there are lots of much smaller, virtual communities. I say 'virtual' because I'm thinking about the conversations taking place and not the physical network carrying them. When you look at conversations, interactions and relationships online, the single community breaks down into cliques, some of them quite insular. The community hacking the Xbox was operating at a very high skill level, far beyond what most people could (or would want to) follow. To give you one example, not only did they need to understand all the signal and bus timings of the chips on the Xbox motherboard, they also needed to understand the mathematical foibles of the cryptography used to secure its data. Much of it is PhD level expertise or beyond.

One hack involved discovering that the algorithm used to secure part of the Xbox's code was something called TEA - and then understanding the significance of that. To make sure no one tampered with important parts of the Xbox system, Microsoft used TEA to compute a magic number for the start-up program. The magic number was like a miniature snapshot of the program's contents. If you modified the start-up program that modification would show up when the system worked out the new TEA number: if the software had changed, the number would change, and the box would refuse to run your modified program. So you couldn't take control of the console just by writing your own programs and substituting them for the official ones. 

Except that the hackers researched the TEA algorithm, which hadn't been written by Microsoft, but simply borrowed by them. They found out that TEA had a weakness. Almost any change you could make to the program would alter the TEA number, but there was an exception. If you made a change in exactly the right place, by exactly the right amount, the TEA number came out the same. Then it was just a matter of finding a single line of the program that could be altered in this way so that it did something useful. One hacker discovered an instruction that told the program to jump to a new routine. He was able to alter the location the instruction tried to jump to so that it was now jumping to a point completely outside the startup program, to an area of memory that anyone could modify. The hacker could place his own programs in that location and the console would run them.

The point of telling you all this? Well, often the movie stereotype of the hacker is a solitary teenager or twenties slacker in his mother's basement. But the group that hacked the Xbox were a community, spread all over the world, cooperating and collaborating at a very advanced level. They weren't a criminal gang - in fact many of them were very careful to make sure they did nothing illegal - they were a cadre of software and hardware experts that formed spontaneously around a shared challenge. In a very real sense, I doubt whether a hand-picked team of highly-paid Microsoft engineers could exceed the capabilities of such a group, because it was better motivated and in some ways better matched to the task in hand - because it wasn't 'just a job' for any of the hackers - none of them had been <em>assigned</em> to the project. The only hackers on the team were there because they were on the trail of a problem that matched their talents and captured their imaginations.

The internet increasingly allows people to seek out the two or three - or maybe fifty or sixty - people on the planet who are on exactly the same wavelength as them. The book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hacking-Xbox-Introduction-Reverse-Engineering/dp/1593270291/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1214150576&sr=8-1"">Hacking the Xbox</a>, was written by the first guy to devise a way of taking control of the console to run his own code. He was an electronics student at MIT at the time. Microsoft responded to his discoveries by making some changes to the Xbox motherboard. And then the next hack was completed by a Brit, in his late thirties, who'd previously worked as a hardware designer. The next breakthrough came from another student, this term living in Munchen in Germany. But none of these people was working alone. They were all drawing on the advice and freely offered knowledge of the others in the group. And none of the key individuals was interested in pirating games. They were interested in the challenge, and in honing their diagnostic and security skills. In fact some of them thought they were doing a noble thing. Microsoft had based the Xbox on the guts of a PC, and then they'd sold it for considerably less than the components cost, aiming to make their money back by selling games. If you could hack the Xbox to run your own programs - instead of playing games - you could turn a games console into a PC, with the cost heavily subsidised by a giant corporation not known for its philanthropy.

I like to imagine that in the future companies will work in the same way as hacking communities or open-source programming teams. Instead of bored office-workers clock-watching and whinging, a few more of us might be able to find challenges that really appeal to our personalities, capabilities and self-image. Geography can't always be relied upon to provide you with the right individuals to spark your creativity or complement your skills. Hopefully the internet can do better.","","","","2008-06-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

For those among you who read non-fiction, do you ever get stuck into some new book and you realise that everything you're reading is now what you think, and if you thought anything before you picked up the book, you can't quite remember what it was? I've broken off from reading Shaping Things by Bruce Sterling because I know I'm in the middle of one of those experiences. He's talking about the relationship between society and the objects it makes. It doesn't sound exciting, but he's slicing the world and its history neatly at the joints and laying out the choice cuts in ways you've never seen done before. <em>Oh so that's why we think that way! Ahh, I see how we got here now! Yes, that must be how it works!</em> It's funny, personal, brilliant and grand. It's only a slim volume, and somewhat eccentrically typeset, but Amazon thinks you can pick up a copy for a <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/offer-listing/0262693267/ref=sr_1_olp_1?ie=UTF8&s=gateway&qid=1214225984&sr=8-1"">fiver</a> (plus postage).

I've got as far as the author laying out all the reasons and the central summary of the book and I'm about to get into the detail. Having read his work before, I don't think I'm likely to be let down by what follows. And the idea is this: being a gas-guzzling nation isn't a great idea for America even if (and it's a huge 'if') you set aside any thoughts of global climate change.","That's because the gas-guzzling lifestyle wastes most of the oil it consumes. It's also because America puts vast amounts of cash and effort into securing its future oil supplies. Even before the current Iraq adventure, America was spending billions on keeping troops ready to deploy in the Middle East - by some estimates the cost was around $25 per barrel. (And in the Seventies, Nixon was apparently discussing invading Saudi if they continued to keep the price of oil high.) And sudden oil price spikes have been seen as an important factor in the last few American recessions. (This book was written a couple of years ago, so I suspect there'll be another data point to add to that trend when the second edition is printed.)

So the book's central thesis is that it would save America a lot of money and hassle to wean itself off oil. There would be a lot of investment required but it would more than pay off: economically, in terms of national security, in terms of world opinion and in terms of not nuking the planet's thermostat. It's both a moral imperative <em>and</em> a profit opportunity. 

Which would be a very uplifting and reassuring message... if I thought there was a chance someone might act on it. (Can someone send a copy of this book to Upcoming President Obama with a 'very urgent' sticker on it.)

<hr/>

I'm really currying favour here, because I know Amory Lovins is a personal hero of one SnowBlog reader. If I add a quote from Nixon, I know I can keep at least one other SnowBlog reader (and Nixon fan) happy:

President Nixon addressing Congress in 1971: ""One reason we use energy so lavishly today is that the price of energy does not include all the social costs of producing it. The costs incurred in protecting the environment and the health and safety of workers, for example, are part of the real costs of producing energy - but they are not now all included in the price of the product.""","","","","2008-06-27","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

<a href=""http://historicalboys.blogspot.com/2008/06/interview-with-sarah-bower-author-of.html"">Here's </a>a lovely interview with Sarah Bower, author of The Needle in the Blood and The Book of Love. 

And click below to read a lovely piece by Sally Zigmond. Thanks to Sally for letting me reproduce it here:","<div style=""font-family: courier; color: #000080; padding: 0px 50px;"">

Although expelled from Spain by royal edict in 1492, young Jewess Esther's fate is more fortunate than others of her race. She journeys eastwards, her mother tragically dying on the way, to Rome and her father who lends money to the Borgias and where, after arranging her expedient conversion to Christianity, he secures her a post in Lucrezia Borgia's household. From that moment on, her fortunes are not only tied to those of her mistress but to her brother Cesare with whom, from the moment she sees him, falls deeply and irrevocably in love. But is this love or a nave infatuation? And can it ever hope to be fulfilled?

            Although dubbed by Cesare 'La Violante' (oath-breaker or treacherous one)  Esther ultimately realizes that she is only one pawn, not only in the power games played between the Borgias and their enemies and allies alike, but more dangerously, in that more darkly intimate one between brother and sister. 

            With her secure knowledge of and intelligent take on Medieval Italian politics and her innate ability to create compelling and convincing characters, Sarah Bower has again woven a rich tapestry in her second novel. It is indeed a book of love in all its guises. More than one love story unfolds as the pages turn and love, as well as blind, can be twisted and crippled.

            Although Esther may not appear as immediately empathetic a character as Gytha in Sarah's debut novel, The Needle in the Blood  there were times I wanted to scream at her for mooning over of one of history's nastier creations  you gain a deep understanding of her total powerlessness and alienation from the world in which she finds herself through no fault of her own. 

            The Book of Love is a richly satisfying historical novel. It deserves prizes. But there is one award Sarah Bower will never ever win and that is the Bad Sex Award that awaits those hapless novelists whose descriptions of the sex-act are either pornographic or toe-curlingly naff. Her love scenes are charged with the most delicious eroticism! But she is also heart-wrenchingly tender and surely no-one could fail to weep for the pain Esther endures as she learns the hard way where your dreams can lead you. </div>","","","","2008-07-01","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Strikes me I haven't done much Amazon bashing lately. Let me correct that. Amazon have been doing more of their ham-fisted cross-selling again. In retail circles there are often innovative ideas about what we (ex)shopkeeping types call 'merchandising' and you call 'deciding which products go on which shelves'. The old chestnut is a supermarket display set out on a Friday night that contains cold beer next to nappies for all the supposed dads with young families stopping in on their way home. I think the logic is that the housewife they're married to asks them to pick up the nappies and their eye alights on the adjacent brewskis. But you can imagine that the success of this sort of thing is all down to the execution. You don't want to make it obvious you see your customers as either stereotypes or clich&eacute;s. You don't want to lay out your store entirely based on cute cross-selling opportunities so that there's no Beer section of the store any more, only <em>Buddies' Fishing Trip</em> and <em>Parents Out of Town</em> departments. In Amazon's case they sent me an e-mail recommending one DVD based on my purchase of another. I bought the recent Sci-Fi Channel re-imagining of the Wizard of Oz story (which I found really laboured, badly structured and disappointing, despite a pretty solid cast). On the strength of that they recommended a DVD about reducing my stress levels through meditation, courtesy of a celebrity stress-doctor. Ahhh, how well they continue to not know me. Celebrity-endorsed lifestyle fads are among the last things I would ever take an interest in. And how did they get there from a Sci-Fi mini-series? Customised cross-selling is clever; Amazon's version of it is not. (Unless they knew the mini-series was rubbish and recommended the de-stressing DVD to help me not blame them for the fact.)","","","","","2008-07-01","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

I have an aching shoulder. This is because I have been concentrating very hard on a particular task for a few solid hours this morning, which I suppose has made me tense up a bit, and my shoulder seems to have seized up as a result. It could also be because I'm not using my RSI-avoiding padded wrist rest. Sadly, that item has been put to other uses, namely as a brilliant fly-swat. As Rob pointed out at the weekend, it is ironic that a device designed to lower the likelihood of RSI is being actively misused on a task that employs a wrist-flicking motion, repeated over and over again. He suggested adding in a slight right-left movement (he used a fancier word which I've forgotten) which apparently would really guarantee that I'd give myself repetitive strain injury (think of the perpetual small movements made in using a mouse). I seem to have managed quite well on my own, with my patent brand of concentrate-lean-forward-squint-at-too-small-font-whilst-tensing-back-and-shoulders working method. Bah.","<em>Rob's comment:</em>

<a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/news/62067-felix-dennis-behind-bt-buyout.html"">This news</a> made me happy - Butler and Tanner are going to get a new lease of life from entrepreneur Felix Dennis (whose rather excellent book I read last year - even though I had to hide it on the bus since its title is How To Get Rich which is not the sort of thing you really want to be spotted with, no matter how genuine my desire to do exactly that). It made me reflect on the importance of suppliers to the publishing industry, and on our own suppliers in particular.","In the olden days, at Kingfisher, my profession was managing suppliers, since I was a buyer. I know, and understand, all the theory. I have run really quite brutal tenders, and culled 60% of an inflated supplier base. Remember that this is not a period of my life I am particularly proud of, whilst I tell you that one discontinued supplier would phone me late at night with his wife and child crying in the background, yelling at me, telling me I'd ruined his business and his life by discontinuing his products from B&Q. I probably had. I was just following orders. Sigh. So much to make up for. 

So it's important to me at Snowbooks that we have good relationships with our suppliers, that we work with companies we like, and that we treat them in a nice and friendly manner. Some, like Zen Internet, Cerub PR, the fabulous and wise ladies at Allison and Busby who manage our sales, our accountants Vantis, our bank Coutts, my wonderful, frequently-life-saving bookkeeper Kundan, the office supplies company Euroffice and the IT supplies company Dabs take my breath away with their astonishingly good service, charm and all round efficiency. Others who I am forced to deal with, such as BT, are of course appalling, and I'll move away from them the first chance I get. Still more don't even seem to realise that they're suppliers, and we're the customer, like some sales agencies, literary agents and, indeed, authors. 

And there are others who I talk to day in, day out - without whom, and their support and competence, Snowbooks would be lost. Take, for instance, the marvellous JH Haynes and Co., Ltd, of Sparkford, Yeovil, Somerset. They print all our books, to what I feel is the highest standard for the cost, in Somerset. Yes, they even print our four colour books, at prices that are certainly comparable with the Far East and definitely in a more convenient location. 

It is a real pleasure to have a working relationship with a company who clearly care about their work, and who have a lightness of touch when it comes to balancing cheerfulness with competence. They keep their promises. If something goes wrong, they're straight on the phone. They worry, obsess and panic on my behalf over problems that I wouldn't really worry too much about, like whether a piece of embossing is going to stand up proud enough - but they do, because they are Good Eggs. Charles, my contact, often emails me at 7.30 on a Saturday morning - I think he works more hours than I do. 

I would recommend them above all others - and I've used many of the others at some point. Although I'm trying to atone for my sins as a multiple retailer buyer, I still obsess about cost, and Haynes knock their competition into a cocked hat on that score, to the extent that I actually feel rather aggrieved at some of my previous print suppliers for charging me so much more for a lower quality job. 

More companies should be like Haynes - diligent, obsessive, friendly, hard working and proud. I don't think anyone there actually reads my ramblings, but if you do, thanks, chaps, for all you do for us. And thanks to all the suppliers who really do work so hard on our behalf.","","","","2008-07-02","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

At the other end of the 'good supplier' spectrum, I have today taken three phone calls, from the same chap, who does not own a computer. He would like to submit his novel - which he has typed on a typewriter - to Snowbooks. I have tried to explain that not only do we have staff based 4000 miles apart, which means email is our preferred means of communication, but that we would struggle to have a meaningful working relationship without his being online. He didn't know what 'online' meant, and although I tried he couldn't fathom why I wouldn't agree to accept his typewritten manuscript. 'Even if I hand deliver it to the office?' he asked. Even then. 'But it's 200,000 words!' All the more reason not to chop a tree down. 'And how long has the company been established?' I'm dreadfully sorry, I'm rather busy and all the information is on our website. 'Website, dear?' 

Phone call number two was to clarify our postcode. 'N for nothing, one, nine, J for Jezebel, N for nothing?' 

Phone call number three was to ask whether Staples was a good place to buy an email address. I suggested he go to his local library and ask for help there. I hope the concept of a library isn't too modern for him. 

Yes, I am being tough on him - probably over-tough. But he has taken up a half-hour of my day because he scorns computers and 'all that email nonsense.' And I tell you what - if his book's the best book I've ever read; if it's sweeping in its scope and reduces me to impassioned tears, there's no way on earth we're publishing it. There's more to being an author than being able to write.","","","","","2008-07-02","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","9"

Another pregnancy side effect. This one's funny.","The doorbell rang at 8.30, and being a lazy lummox I was still asleep. I worked till midnight, if that makes it any better - but, essentially, I had overslept. I pulled on the nearest dressing gown - one which, as it happens, I haven't worn in a while - and rushed to the door. You can see where this is going. Having flung open the door and apologised for keeping him waiting, the poor postman was assailed by the sight of my pants* **. The dressing gown, turns out, doesn't really fit any more, now I have a rather large bump. 

Ah well. I suppose a gradual stripping away of my dignity is good preparation for childbirth. 

* Thankfully they were good, big pants.

Write a bad review of any of our books or authors, that is. Or say anything remotely negative. Or give a prize that our books should have won to someone else. Or do anything to reduce the chances of our authors' success. It does something to my head which turns me into a rather primal, angry, unreasonable beast.

This week I seem to have been far too busy achieving nothing. In my quiet moments, I've been reading about, and experimenting with, various sorts of electronics. Perhaps it was reading the book about the <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/06/collaborative_hackery.html"">Hacking of the Xbox</a> that did it, but I've been following links to other links and tinkering with off-the-shelf kits for building all sorts of gizmos and spimes. This morning I happen to be exploring the website of one <a href=""http://www.ladyada.net/"">Lady Ada</a>. Girl geniuses in the realm of complex electronics seem a little thinner on the ground than I might have hoped, but Lady Ada certainly qualifies. I was particularly tickled by her <a href=""http://www.ladyada.net/pub/research.html"">Masters Thesis</a> from MIT. In her words <span style=""font-family: courier;"">""In contemporary Western society, electronic devices are becoming so prevalent that many people find themselves surrounded by technologies they find frustrating or annoying. I designed two counter-technologies to help people defend their personal space from unwanted electronic intrusion. The first is a pair of glasses that darken whenever a television is in view.

"41753","","1","The Mystery of the Empty Desk","Publish","true","<img alt=""minidesk.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/minidesk.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""134"" />

I was surprised at the comments a couple of posts back about my empty desk. I don't really notice it - but since you've mentioned it, here's why.","It comes down to batching, just like with my email. I don't open post until I'm ready to deal with it - and usually that means I open a week's post in one go, unless it looks like a cheque! We don't accept unsolicited paper submissions, so there are few huge stacks of paper from them, and the hard copy ones we do get - bound copies and manuscripts alike - go straight in the recycling. That's right, prospective authors and agents - straight in the recycling. Anna lives 4000 miles away and she reads all manuscripts before me. I am not posting them overseas. If there's an SAE enclosed I'll scribble a 'please submit by email' note to the covering letter and return it. But please, just <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/submissions.html"">email them</a>. 

Most post is bills, which is why I open it once a week when I've got Sage open. The bills get logged on Sage (accounting software, as you'll probably know) and then filed in my Invoices Pending black folder (black for the colour of death; money flowing out of the business. Boo. I may be over-dramatising, or at least embuing my filing system with too much symbolism.) There are thirteen dividers in said black folder: one for every month plus a 'queries' tab (or an 'I'm not paying this, cheeky sods, billing me for something I never got' tab). The invoices get filed in the month they're due, and that month gets looked at once every two weeks when I am ready to pay bills. As the bill is paid (always by cheque, for my paper trail which makes bookkeeping so much more simple, and to keep the money in the account just a day or two longer. I know, I am idiotic. It's a known weakness) it's recorded as such in Sage and the invoice is moved to the blue (colour of the sky, hope, release) Receipts folder, with 'paid' and the cheque number scribbled on it. 

Stuff that needs filing upon opening (insurance and legal docs, VAT and tax stuff,) goes in a 'to be filed' folder which is the middle of my in trays, and gets attended to by filing docs in the right lever arch folder when it's full. Stuff which needs doing (prize entry forms, the occasional retailer order, things to be signed etc) goes in my 'in tray' which is the top shelf. Long term stuff that I want to keep on hand, plus stamps for some reason, go in the bottom tray. If the occasional bill sneaks through my defences, it goes in a clear plastic wallet in my intray, ready for batching. 

I have a set of auto-reminders in my Remember the Milk to do list which pop up on a schedule, too. 'Bookkeeping', 'Filing' and 'Pay Bills' pop up every other Monday. 'Bank rec: current account' and 'Bank rec: Barclaycard' pop up every month when the statements are due in. I have a number of these auto reminders - 'sales reporting', 'pay commission', 'update bibliographic agencies', even 'hoover', 'put washing on' and 'check cat food levels'. The more I can get written down and scheduled, the less I have to carry in my head. It sounds so anal, written down like this, but it stops me waking up in the middle of the night because I've forgotten to renew my tax disc / haven't got any milk / forgotten to do the VAT return. 

I don't really struggle with paperwork, then, since there's a system and it's pretty much automatic, or second nature, now. I use the same sort of batching system with email, and think that *is* kind of a big deal since I get so much more email than post, and regularly delight myself with seeing my email at zero (I know, I'm a simple soul). But, weirdly, all of this goes out of the window with our personal paperwork: utility bills, rates, bank statements and so on. They're all on direct debit, and Andy pays most of them, poor thing, but I just HATE filing personal paperwork. I don't see why it's different in my head from company stuff, but it is - like having a main course stomach and a pudding stomach, it is just different. So I don't do it. Witness the Basket of Shame, otherwise known as Amber's Rending Box:

To see the queen. Well, not really the queen. Just Tottenham Court Road and environs, really. But this is the third to last time that I'm planning to be in London until I pop in September / October. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a source of great joy to me. 

It's quite all right, actually, going to London for a day trip. I can poddle to the station in 10 minutes; the train takes under an hour, and then, well, you're in London, aren't you. Muay conveniento. I will take <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Vesuvius-Club-Lucifer-Box-Novel/dp/0743257057"">The Vesuvius Club</a> to read which Andy was chortling over last night. I want a go. 

I have also been thinking about all the ways I am completely inherently disorganised, too, and have been feeling a bit guilty about going on about how organised I appear to be in my desk post below. My desk is one thing; the confused chaos rattling around in my head most days is quite another. You should have seen my computer desktop last week before I reorganised it - there were so many files on it the icons couldn't all fit on my (28"") screen.  I think that's why people like me try to maintain some sort of system to keep everything in order - because if we didn't it would get very ugly, very quickly. Anyway, I didn't want you to think I was doing that trumpet thing again.

This week, I have a head full of quirky electronics (I'm referring to ideas, of course; to the best of my knowledge, my brain itself is still 100% organic). <a href=""http://tinkerlog.com/2007/12/04/arduino-xmas-hitcounter/#more-61"">Here's a foolish gadget</a>, designed in the run-up to last Christmas. It rings a little handbell every time someone visits your website. How cute! I'm wondering if I could adapt it to create a device which until this point has been purely conceptual: the Snowbooks Genre Bell. Not sure who invented it, but I'll guess Em. We mock our own lack of an editorial policy in that the bell is supposedly rung every time we publish a book in a genre that's new to us. And for a while that was pretty much every new title, such was our profligate multi-variedness. I reckon I could knock up some code that scans our outgoing Onix files and, if it sees a genre it hasn't noticed before, gives the bell a bit of a ding. The only question is whether to put it (perhaps even hide it) in Em's office or not. On the one hand, it might be fun. On the other hand, the last time I scared Em she thought she was being attacked by an adder, and that's not a nice thing to do to your best pal and business partner, particularly when she's busy being so pregnant (not to mention the very real threat of reprisals). Maybe I'll fall back on my old favourite spooky trick of making the printer start up and print a message - usually a ghostly 'Boo!' - when Em's the only one working late at night, but this time make it a 'ding'. Less chance of finding an adder in my morning mail that way.","","","","","2008-07-09","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/jul/10/health.nhs"">The front page of the Guardian</a> today is all about the state of maternity care in the NHS at the moment, which I have something of a vested interest in. Summary: it's not pretty.","The Guardian reports that ""the most serious concerns at poorly performing trusts include:

 Insufficient midwives available. Some women report being left alone and frightened during labour. 

 Women not getting the continuity of care with the midwives they met before birth. Obstetricians not spending enough time on the labour ward - despite the Royal College's recommendations. 

 Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence on risky pregnancies not being followed. 

 Too few beds and bathrooms being made available.

 Care and support for women after the birth not being good enough.""

Yep, sounds like my experience so far and the experience of almost every mother writing on <a href=""http://www.mumsnet.com"">mumsnet.com</a> who's given birth in hospital, the leading forum for all things motherly. This is why Andy has saved my bacon by shelling out 3000 for an independent midwife, and why I'm having a home waterbirth with hypnobirthing (all being well). No, I'm not a hippy. No, I don't trust medics. Ever read <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/House-God-Black-Swan/dp/0552991228"">The House of God</a>? 

Could be worse, though. I could live in America, where childbirth is almost entirely medicalised, midwives are a dying breed and the intervention cascade is even more prevalent than here (the thing that happens if, say, you get induced, which leads to stronger contractions, which leads to more pain relief required, possibly epidurals, which leads to a slow down in labour, which leads to a distressed baby, which leads to a c-section.) If you can find it on the internet, watch The Business of Childbirth (the makers are enforcing their copyright so it's not freely available to view, but worth it if you can find it). 

And on the note of independent midwives, here's an astonishing thing. In two years, they could be outlawed in the UK. Yep, it would be illegal to trade as one. Why? Because currently it is impossible to buy insurance as an indie midwife. (Well, you could go to Lloyds, but the annual premiums would be in the hundreds of thousands per policy.) Since there are so few independent midwives in the UK, the market isn't big enough for the insurance companies to make any money from it, so they just don't offer it. That's fine, since those of us who hire indies recognise that there's no insurance. However, the government are currently proposing legislation to make the practice of midwifery illegal without insurance cover. Ergo - illegal to practice. <a href=""http://www.independentmidwives.org.uk/?node=8765"">Read more here</a> and sign the petition - please.

I am 'on holiday', as I think the kids call it nowadays, tomorrow. Not exactly resting, but packing all my London possessions into boxes, ready to be moved to the sticks, before I get too fat or preoccupied with a baby to do this rather onerous chore. So apologies if you try to reach me, but I'll be buried under a large number of boxes filled with books and clothes that don't fit me any more. 

<italic>Update: tomorrow is now today. </italic>","10am: I hate packing things up. I also hate throwing things away. Although I have just thrown away a copy of Vernon God Little, which made me happy. One room down, three to go... 

11am: Four to go, actually. They keep opening up before me like a horror movie house. Surviving on mini Magnums and weak tea. Lots of hard decisions: do I keep the A4 size box of artist grade charcoal? The still-in-its-box wooden blinds from Ikea, bought in 1996? The seventeen pairs of gloves I've unearthed (when I must have spent at least ten non-consecutive hours of my life searching for a single pair)? Kevin McCloud's Lighting Book? The Lexmark printer that came free with a laptop? Other choices are easier: I have so many clothes, and so little desire to wear them again. The bin bags are piling up...

12.45 Ha! Be gone, Possession. Away with you, Midnight's Children (what a joy it was to chuck that one away). Get thee to the bin bag, What Do I Do With All These Zuccini? (I think that last was a printer's sample. I hope, anyway - what possessed me to buy it, if not?) But now, here's a difficult one. What do I do with all my cassettes? For those of you born after 1990s, cassettes were a technology used to record and play music. I don't even have a tape recorder any more. But I have most of The Cure's back catalogue on cassette (as well as CD), and seminal works (Blue Lines, 3 Stone Roses tapes, My Bloody Valentine), and mix tapes! Mix tapes full of crackly, unlistenable-to-quality world music, mostly. But I want to keep them. But it's pointless. What do I doooooo? 

8pm: Done. Knackered. Never again. Sleep. 
(The cassettes are saved! And yep, I threw Possession away - a book with the lowest expectation to enjoyment ratio I've ever known. Plus we'd been using that copy to prop open a window so it was rather sodden.)","","","","2008-07-10","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","5"

Though it happened last year, I've only just noticed that SF author, Neal Stephenson, came to London and gave a talk about genre publishing. He spoke for 40 mins and the <a href=""http://fora.tv/2008/05/08/Neal_Stephenson_Science_Fiction_as_a_Literary_Genre"">video is here</a>. He's a slightly monotonous speaker which means it takes a while to warm to him, but after a bit his flatness starts to seem like a comic device and actually makes his little witticisms funnier. Sadly, the presentation flags a bit in the final ten minutes, but before that there are lots of good, chunky insights and (to the best of my knowledge) some completely original dissections of what's been going on with the genres of storytelling in the last half-century. To whet your appetite: one of his early theories is that previous genres have to some extent disappeared outside the world of books because the romantic genre has suffused the whole world of movie-making while the crime/mystery genre has been incorporated into most television.","","","","","2008-07-11","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Over the last couple of weeks I've done a lot of Snowangels work - the branch of the business that offers cover design, consultancy, that sort of thing. It's both enjoyable for me, and a good way to boost the Snowcoffers, although it does mean that I have to work quite hard. However, I've just checked our weekly sales, which get updated on a Saturday. We've had returns that come to pretty much the same value as the consultancy work, give or take a tenner or two. 

It's rather - sobering? upsetting? frustrating? - to know that instead of working 13 hour days for two weeks managing both Snowbooks and Snowangels, I could have sat staring at the wall and had the same net financial result.","What's to be done? Returns are idiotic, and it's taking all my reserves not to pepper that description with expletives. I've said it before, but here's the effect of returns:

1) We have to print books in order to send them to stores - let's say 0.80 per copy
2) We have to pay the distributor to send them to stores - let's say 0.63 a copy
3) When a book is returned to the distributor they charge us either 6% of gross revenue to process it back into stock, or 2% to pulp it. We pulp all mono paperbacks that are returned to us. Dwell on that for a moment. 
4) It's at this point that we realise the cost of print / the stock value, which sits on the balance sheet - because there's no chance of being able to sell that copy again.
5) We may also have paid royalties on goods sold that then get returned. The amount owing to the author on their ledger is reduced, but since most fiction's sales are front loaded, it's unlikely that the book will earn its way back for us to recover this loss. 
6) Returns wreak havoc with our cash flow. Imagine budgeting activities based on how much money is on your sales ledger. Then arbitrarily reduce that number with no warning. It's nigh on impossible to forecast cash flow. 
7) Our distributor doesn't collect all the money owing to all their publishers every week, because of invoice queries, late payers and so on. They divvy up the difference between what they're owed and what they receive between publishers based on their returns profile. So at any time we have 5000-25000 'reserved' against our account (depending on our returns rate and on how much money has not been collected) which is made up of money that's actually nothing to do with Snowbooks, but is owing to various different publishers.

Not to mention the shocking waste of diesel, paper, effort, store labour - god, it's completely retarded, and so, SO frustrating when the simple, tried and tested stock management methods I learned ten years ago would eliminate returns overnight. We had a chance to dramatically reduce returns with the Industry Returns Inititative - but all that did was automate the returns process, rather than get to the root of the problem.

On the other hand, if we published books that sold a million copies with no effort, I wouldn't have this problem. So I need to acknowledge that we need to publish books that sell - both into retailers and out to readers. That's what it's all about, after all. I think we do an ok job of this most of the time - we're still here, after all - but there's always room for improvement.   

That doesn't mean that returns, at the current rate that we all experience, are acceptable. My feelings are that the publishing industry can be charmingly backward all it likes. But when its idiotic idiosyncracies make it so hard for me to run our business, and result in so much needless waste, it really does infuriate me.","","","","2008-07-12","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","6"

but it's just possible - just, fractionally, within the bounds of possibility - that I may be slightly hormonal at the moment.","On Saturday, as you can guess from the godzilla-y tone of my rant about returns, I was dismayed about sales being down, thought everything was doomed, was completely freaked out at the idea of having to give birth really quite soon (I have dubbed it The Cleaving), and felt quite odd.

Let's assume that normal service will be resumed sometime in November, once all these hormones are watered down a bit - or I'm too knackered to have extremes of feelings.

<em>&agrave; propos</em> of nothing at all, I was mulling plot ideas the other day and wondered about this one for a TV series(s): the pilot sets up the various goings-on of a group of people culminating in a Sliding Doors event - that's to say some development that has a major impact on the future storyline, but we follow not only that narrative, but a parallel one in which the event didn't happen. The twist here is that from one pilot there are two TV series, shown on different nights of the week, starring roughly the same group of people - one for each parallel world. In one Danny is revealed to be Frank's murderer but in the other world Frank's widow seems to be getting romantically attached to him. Will she guess the truth? When Devon learns who the father of Michelle's baby is he leaves her, but in the parallel world his drinking is making him increasingly violent; how will he react when the secret finally comes out.

It's all very well me going on about how awful returns are. But so far I haven't offered a solution. Here is what I would do if I ran a bookshop chain. 

(Warning - I haven't written the post yet but it's bound to be long.) 

(I've written it now - it is.)","A lot of what follows comes down to learning from other retail sectors. The history of stock control and forecasting is long and (if you're me) interesting. In the 1980s, many of today's leading retailers were starting their careers at the Burton Group, Mars and P&G, where they learned what at the time were cutting edge supply chain and merchandising processes. 

Several such processes, which have been standard in high street retail for many years now, concern forecasting and stock control. To forecast how much stock they'll need, supply chain managers group products according to their sales profile: 

1) core stock - products which stay on the shelf week in, week out. Think Stephen King's backlist, the Dummies series, OUP's Very Short Introductions, Maeve Binchy, etc. 

2) new products - those without a sales history. 

3) promotional products - those which will be introduced in store and sold within a short period of time

Further layers of complexity get introduced when it comes to the stores themselves: 

1) Store size and shape. Not all stores within one retailer are not the same size and shape. Retailers who grow through acquisition are especially susceptible to having stores, as well as fixtures and fittings, of different shapes and sizes, since the old shelving tends to get used - it's jolly expensive to refit 100 stores in one go with standard shelves. 

2) Store geography. A store in Torbay has a very different customer profile to a store in Covent Garden. I was extolling the virtues of our horror novels to Matthew from The Torbay Bookshop yesterday who gently told me that their core customer base is approaching or in retirement age - not obvious lovers of American vampire novels. 

3) Position in town. There are two big DIY stores in Morden, South London, but one is on an out of town retail estate and one is in the town centre. They serve different shopping needs for different customers. 

So you can have neither the same range nor forecast for all products in, say, a 30,000 sq ft store in Covent Garden and a 7000 sq ft store in Carmarthen.  That's fine, though, because you develop ranges. Ranges are typically planned and communicated to stores via planograms - a drawing of the shelf fixture, with the products indicated. Here's a 12ft, 8ft and 4ft planogram for some power tools. 

<img alt=""plano.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/plano.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""134"" />

The 4ft planogram contains only the lines with the highest sales and margin forecasts. It makes sense that if you have restricted space, you only include products that are going to give the highest return. On the 8ft planogram, you can include more products with more modest forecasts. On the largest planogram, you have more space to include the full range of products. 

(As an aside, in our previous roles, Rob and I  lost count of the number of times a buyer said ""oh, I need to include product X for 'range credibility'"", by which they mean you need untested, sexy products that the buyer really likes in the range to give shoppers a sense that the retailer is an expert in this field. This has been proven again and again to be nonsense. There've been many studies which prove that the fewer the products in a range, the greater the perceived choice by the shopper. Too many, and it's brain overload - you just can't process all the different choices. This is where packaging and genre clues come in, but that's a cover design discussion for another day (or indeed, a previous day, as we've blogged about this before.)) 

So if planograms are based on projected/forecast sales and margin, how do retailers come up with those forecasts? And how do those forecasts translate into actual orders? 

<u>Forecasting</u>

With lines that have a sales history, it's easy. You look at what's sold before, adjust for availability and seasonality and assume that the following 12 months will look pretty similar. 

Adjusting for availability means if sales were 1000 units per month except in July when they were 50 units, you check that you actually had some stock in July. If you were out of stock, that's a clue that July's sales would normally have been 1000. 

Adjusting for seasonality means that if the sales graph is a nice bell curve peaking in May and dropping to zero in November, you're probably looking at a barbeque or a summer dress. You usually have to adjust for Christmas and Easter bank holiday, as well. Buyers will often try to adjust for made up events like The Diana Effect (the UK marked its mourning for their princess by not shopping for a couple of days), The World Cup Effect (everyone was drinking too much to shop) or The Weather (the catch-all excuse to get buyers out of trouble if sales are poor) but you shouldn't listen to them. 

For lines that are new, and promotional, you might think that there's no data available so it's finger in the air time - but no. Contrary to what manufacturers (and I'll include authors in that) believe, their product (book) is not unique. There is always a similar product out there that retailers can learn from. I remember a meeting at Superdrug when I was Men's Toiletries assistant buyer. Gilette were launching the Mach 3 and were adamant there was nothing else like it. Well, correct, there wasn't, but we used the Sensor Excel launch sales profile with an increase of 7% and were exactly right - we had 92% availability and only 8% stock outs. That's notable in itself - you don't want to have 100% availability, and you do want to sell out of stock. If you have 100%, it means you have far too much stock. If you sell through, you've not got a load of stock left over to sell at discount or - ah, we come to the point - return to sender. 

Fashion retailers manage far more new lines than book retailers. Take Zara - they seem to have new stock in every week, which they sell through. They are vertically integrated - they manufacture their own goods - so they can't rely on returns. Instead they hedge their bets by delaying manufacture till they see what sales are like. Say they list a wrapover dress. They will cut the cloth in various sizes and colours, make up a certain number of each, send them into store and see which sizes and colours sell the best. They'll rapidly make up the waiting stock and ship out only the bestsellers. 

<u>Orders</u>

So once a forecast is agreed, how are the orders calculated? Various algorithms can be used, but here's one normal approach. 

Orders are divided into two different types: store and warehouse. (Some retailers use direct to store deliveries, but this is very old fashioned. Oddly, Borders are just closing their warehouse and moving to store direct delivery. I can't say I quite understand this.) To calculate warehouse orders for an ongoing line, the analyst looks at the average weekly sale for the last 4 weeks, then at the number of week's cover they'd like, then at the agreed lead time with the supplier. So if the average weekly sale for a line per store is 13 units, and there are 100 stores ranging the line, and the stock level is 2300 units, you have 1.7 week's cover. If your lead time is 5 days, you might want to place an order for 400 units, to take you up to 2 week's cover which is your target. Any more and you have quite a lot of stock - and that's bad for the retailer's balance sheet (especially if it's coming up to year end). 

Once the stock is in the warehouse, you can pay attention to store orders. Many lines are on autoreplen, or automatic replenishment. This means that a computer program does a quick calculation based on the average weekly sale in store, the presentation quantity (how many units you want to have in store at all times to make the fixture look nice - usually two units), the required weekly sales cover to be held in store (usually 1.5 weeks if a store has two deliveries a week) and the weekly sales forecast as entered by the stock analyst. The analyst will scan these automatically generated orders to see that nothing's too amiss (for instance if a product is coming off promotion the analyst will pay special attention to future orders - you don't want to base them on promotional sales). 

For promotional and new lines - say, for a Christmas range - it's very important to stagger how stock gets into stores. Usually the team will agree how the stock allocation will be weighted - say, 40:20:20 (Sept Oct Nov) with the final 20% left on hand at the supplier to call in if sales are on track. There is also a planned sell through calculation. Most retailers aim to sell through (in other words, sell out) of their Christmas range by mid December, which gives them time to prepare the clearance paperwork to send to stores. They are perfectly happy to have some lines that have 90-95% sell through by early December. This is a different mindset to a lot of book retailers. 

The key to managing stock levels like this is communication with the supplier. Retailer and supplier together agree what the lead time is, what the supplier's reserve stock levels should be, what the sales forecast at store and warehouse level should be and what the exit plan is. Perhaps the book retailers do this detailed category management planning with the large publishers, but it doesn't happen for smaller suppliers. We receive orders rounded to the nearest thousand or hundred - always a warning sign. 

Let's be clear - this isn't the buyer's problem (although, of course, it impacts on their days). This is an infrastructural problem - seems to me that book retailers are missing a couple of functions that have been normal for ages in other retail sectors. Those are a pricing function (because in our industry it's the manufacturer that sets the retail price), and a collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment function (CPFR). I also get the sense that the IT systems of book retailers are less than fully integrated across all functions (which Borders appear to be addressing at the moment). This isn't that unusual - systems often grow organically, with one chap in the IT department frantically lashing together the old IBM AS400 mainframe that they bought in the 90s and adding a data warehouse here, a bespoke planogram tool there until it's a bit of a mess. That chap then usually gets a really good job offer from PriceWaterhouseCoopers or somewhere, which means that next time a bit of the system starts to unravel the company goes into meltdown. Usually happens around year end, when you start to hear heroic stories on the grapevine of people sleeping under their desks for days on end to manually haul the business back into repair. To say that I am glad I'm out of this picture is something of an understatement. 

<u>Summary</u>

I started this by saying 'this is what I'd do'. To summarise, then, I would:

1) Introduce standard range planning systems, to include planograms mapped to sales and margin per linear foot forecasts, including range planning for seasonal promotions, not just core stock. 
2) Ensure that an autoreplen system was working well and had the correct assumptions in it - like supplier lead time and agreed weeks' cover - and that all products were assigned a sales profile based on either their own historical sales or historical sales of a similar title. 
3) Establish CPFR workgroups with suppliers to manage the product lifecycle. This would be to get the right level of availability, to keep the supplier appraised of how much stock they should be holding for the retailer to call off, the agreed lead times, and the promotional plans for the next 12 months. 

I would also revisit the convention of having pile-it-high tables of stock at the front of store. I would make these tables browseable but not like bargain basement tables. To satisfy shoppers' need to rummage, I'd have dump bins, but would reserve the tables to be dressed - think about the tables in Laura Ashley's Home stores, which give the shopper a beautifully merchandised taster that leads them into the rest of the store. This would return the book to icon, special product status rather than the old Tesco pile it high model from the 60s.

I am also going to pinch one of Rob's ideas now, and propose that my chain would have one or two Clearance stores - like Next have. I would ship all overstocks to these stores and discount them heavily. There's a Books Etc store in Bicester Village like this, near me - but the stock seem to be damages and special purchases rather than overstocks. This would result in overstocks generating a bit of money, rather than being returned to the supplier for zero gain. 

<u>Finally...</u>

I would love to talk to other independent publishers about this sort of thing. It could even be the case that we might want to form a bit of a group - Independents For Forecasting would probably be better than Independents Against Returns (purely from the acronym point of view, IFF is better than IAR). As I say, perhaps the large retailers and publishers do get together to plan their stock properly - but since we hear tales of high returns from publishers large and small, there does seem to be room for improvement. If you'd be interested, say so in the comments. I'd also love to hear if you have any further things to add to how we can together manage stock control - I am aware that this post only glosses over the surface of the subject and there are lots of omissions (I haven't even described category management). Come, one and all!","","","","2008-07-16","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

A speech and a sad demise.","Yesterday I went to Birmingham to the BA's independent bookseller conference do a speech on Online Social Networking. No, I don't really know what that means, either. In it I advised people not to bother with Facebook, Bookrabbit, Flickr, Second Life and everything and to focus on blogs. I also said don't bother doing anything at all if you don't enjoy it, or are dedicated to it. The slides I used are <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Social%20networking.pdf"">here</a>. It was lovely to catch up with some old friends, some of whom blog, some of whom don't. What I was rather alarmed at, though, was the handful of people in the audience who actually didn't know what a blog was. A steep learning curve is ahead of them, I feel. If you were in the audience and want clarification on anything I said, do drop me a line - emma [@] snowbooks.com. 

Secondly, Publishing News is to cease publication. This is deeply sad, and since the fine editorial team there are to be made redundant, traumatic too. Deep sympathy to them. Aside from the personal sadness, I think this is the first instance I have witnessed where *not* having an online strategy has possibly resulted in the demise of a business. PN's website has not been a patch on The Bookseller's, and since they cite ad revenue moving online as a key reason for their problems, they have not been in a position to switch the ad revenue to a strong online offering. Question is whether having an online presence of a trade mag is sufficient - diversification of revenue streams is probably necessary, although of course PN did that through their sponsorship of the Nibbies and ownership of BML which will continue in business. It's awfully sad, anyway, and fondest wishes to the team.","","","","2008-07-16","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

There are some strange ways of marking time.","There are also some very normal ones - months and years. It's our fifth anniversary this year, for instance. I like clocking up prizes, too - those are good milestones. Another (rather fundamental) way of measuring progress is financial. 

But we've also had another milestone recently - we've run out of our first batch of 100 ISBNs. You have to apply for - and pay for - ISBNs from the ISBN agency, and you can get them in blocks of 10, 100 or, I don't know, a million if you're rich - I didn't read that far in their oh-so-fascinating documentation. We started with 10, with a prefix (as it was pre-13digit days) 09545759-- - apparantly the first warning sign for retailers that a book is from a small press. We then bought 100, prefix 9781905005---, and it's these we've run out of. 

I remember when we got them, in early 2005, flicking to the back of the pack and wondering what the business would look like when we got to ISBN number 100. The first title on the list was EM Forster's Celestial Omnibus - our least most profitable title ever. Good job. The last was a book Anna's just signed for next year, The Blue Handbag by the phenomenal Fiona Robyn, which I'll rave about separately. 

There's certainly been progress. We're not exactly rich, though - or anything approaching not-poor. There's a long way to go before I'd consider ourselves properly successful. But it's fascinating to mark this milestone, and think where we've been, what we've done, and what's to come. I wonder where we'll be at the end of this next batch of 100 - prefix 9781906727...","","","","2008-07-16","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

A little while ago I talked about how the weather can lower your retail sales, but <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/06/i_would_write_a_brilliant_post.html"">never raise them</a>. That's retail; in other industries, different scapegoats are required. Here are a few. If a server or website goes down, the first thought is never in-house incompetence or poor preparation; it's bound to be hackers or viruses. And music, movie and <a href=""http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/07/17/scea-ceo-jack-tretto.html"">games</a> manufacturers don't lose money because they've put out an unpopular product; it's piracy and illegal downloads that are to blame. Airlines weren't in serious trouble as far back as the late Nineties; their woes started with 911. (Likewise, Coalition soldiers don't get attacked by Iraqis; it's Al Qaeda who do the damage.) Banks didn't make crazy high-risk bets this decade; they were caught out by an unforeseen credit crunch. Western oil companies may make more money than any previous human endeavour but the fault lies with OPEC. Which is also why the American auto industry is dying; not because they make engineering dinosaurs that would be wasteful even if this were still the Sixties. Trains are delayed by late-running predecessors; they are never the original cause. Any more?","","","","","2008-07-17","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

...is yet another house moving day for us. This time we're having Men come round to take all our old junk from the London house, which we're about to put on the market (and if you make a comment on what a great time it is to be doing that I'll block you from this blog), to the recycling place, then we're having More Men come over to take our remaining stuff to the countryside. And then that will be all the moving house a couple can do in one year.

Lady Ada (who I've <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/07/lady_ada.html"">posted about</a>) has produced a video with one of the guys from <a href=""http://www.makezine.com/"">MAKE: Magazine</a> (which I've <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/04/tips.html"">posted</a> <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/03/make.html"">about</a>).

Then Lady Ada takes a secondhand New York payphone, converts it work on Skype, demand a quarter before it will work, after which she modifies it so that it will work with the first generation of phone hacking tools which date back to the days when there were no hackers, only Phone Phreaks.

your tolerance for house-moving updates will be as low as my tolerance for house-moving, by now. But you'll be reassured to hear that it's all done and dusted. Literally.","Is it just me who has to suffer the Skirting Boards of Shame, on a house move? I mean, I'm hardly the most diligent of housewives, but do people really pull out their wardrobes, cabinets and chests of drawers to hoover behind them? Oh, you do? Oh dear. When we looked around our empty London house, I couldn't believe the state of what's been going on behind our furniture. I blame smoky, smoggy, filth-laden London - not my cleaning habits. 

Anyway, filth aside, the two sets of men did their thing (one of them 24 hours late, it should be noted, but never mind) and we now have one empty London house ready for decorating (thanks, Dave!) and one gorgeous country house with the furniture in the right place and - and be impressed here - all the books on the shelves, and all the clothes neatly folded and put away, AND everywhere hoovered and polished and dusted and cleaned to a sparkle. I am quite tired today! I'm not sure if cold viruses live in wardrobes, or dust or something, but Andy and I appear to have acquired one each, plus my hips are jippy, so we feel like physical wrecks today. Still - at least publishing requires you, for the most part, to be sitting down. 

In other news: our weekend reading for when we needed a breather has been about bread and grammar. I'm going to badger Andy to do a guest book review for this blog on the book he's reading at the moment - <em>Bread Matters: The State of Modern Bread and a Definitive Guide to Baking Your Own</em>. The only possible conclusion from it is that, due to something called the Chorleywood process which allows manufacturers to make a loaf of bread in a couple of hours, eating shop-bought bread is very bad for your health. The process destroys all the vitamins present in the flour, which manufacturers then have to add back in (and put a nice marketing spin on it - ""fortified with Vit C, E and B!""). It was only after this process was introduced in the 1960s that Coeliac's disease was recognised. It makes bread practically indigestible for many people. And we've been eating it now for 50 years. Gulp. 

My reading has been Strunk and White's grammar book. I've never read it, because it's American probably, but Andy bought a copy recently and I was intrigued. It's so thin - about 70 pages - but incredibly concise. I find I can't read more than two pages at once before the grammar centres of my brain get overloaded. 

So that's our weekend - bread, books and back-breaking homemaking. Hope you had a good one too!","","","","2008-07-21","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

<p><a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/Emson_schedule.html"">Look at what </a>horror writer extraordinaire Thomas Emson has sent in - his writing schedule for his new horror novel Skarlet, which Snowbooks is delighted to be publishing next year. Such discipline. </p>","He says: 

THE SKARLET ROUTINE.

THE writing of Skarlet started, as you can see from the sheet, on February 22 this year, with 390 words. That week I wrote just under 5,300 words. I set myself weekly targets. Theyre better for me than daily ones. If I had a daily 1,500 words target, and I missed a day, Id be frustrated. But with a weekly target of between 5,000 and 10,000 words, it doesnt matter if I miss a day: I can always catch up. If you look at that first month, youll see I did miss a few days: March 5, March 16, a few here and there. But, as you can see from the weekly totals, I always caught up: 12,313 that second week; more than 9,000 words on each of the other two weeks. The 36,305 figure is my word total for the month. The second month of writing, youll see, resulted in more than 45,000 words  and just one day off: March 21. I finished the first draft on April 26 with 2,753 words  written, there, in red. I revised a little in the following days, but then took some time out, focusing on other projects. And for the past couple of months Ive been going re-writing and revising that first draft.

I'm starting to notice reviewers of various high-tech goods also giving opinions on the packaging of the gadget in question. Too much? Too wasteful? Or in the case of the all-cardboard packaging in which Sennheiser ships some of its headphones: singled out for praise. And you'll be aware of how far ahead of the UK countries like Switzerland or Germany are when it comes to rules about recycling. Presumably their lead will exert some influence on us to follow. Which brings me to a point I made a while back: how long before someone's eye alights on a paperback bestseller and it dawns on them that this is just cheap, disposable packaging for text that could be delivered in other ways? Some people are already talking about CDs that way: pointing out that pressing millions of shiny disks, putting them in cases, driving them around the country just so that someone can end up with a few extra strings of digits on their iPod is rather wasteful.","Should a decent eReader emerge, that's satisfactory for reading thrillers and romances on, won't the same logic be applied to the millions of novels a year that are read once and then spend uncounted years gathering dust? Lately I've been frightening the life out of myself by looking at predictions of what will happen to our climate if we don't take massive action in the next seven years. Then I take a quick glance at the newspapers and note that none of this action is either underway or really under serious contemplation. Which presumably means we'll see a series of climate-related cataclysms and everyone will suddenly wake up to the drawbacks of a disposable economy. Might massmarket paperbacks be an early casualty of an anti-waste backlash?","","","","2008-07-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Before I moved to the countryside, and lived beside open wheat fields, I'd never heard of thrips. They're tiny little black insects, like a barely noticeable snip of black thread, but around this time of year they exit the wheat fields in their billions and make a nuisance of themselves. They wiggle their way into LCD displays (I have a couple with permanent black dots inside them), into picture frames and land on your skin, moving around just enough to make you itch. They're easy enough to pick off but there are so many of them. And the outsides of my windows at this moment contain hundreds of them, queued up and waiting to get in. Hopefully if I stay indoors, under a blanket, I'll be OK. See you again once it starts getting frosty.","","","","","2008-07-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

I have had a completely traumatic week, because of a personal something that I'm not at liberty to discuss on the blog, but for which it would be very useful if I could find a webpage from March 2008 - now deleted - that proves a certain thing. So I've been researching caching, archiving and recovery of old web pages, and in my travels I've come across The Wayback Machine - and oh my god, it's awesome. 

Run by <a href=""http://www.archive.org/about/faqs.php"">archive.org</a> - the Internet Archive - the Wayback machine (named in reference to the famous Mr. Peabody's WABAC (pronounced way-back) machine from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon show) is a service that allows people to visit archived versions of Web sites. Sadly it couldn't find me my bit of evidence, but hoo boy, did it make up for it in other ways.","So of course the first thing I checked out was <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.snowbooks.com"">snowbooks.com.</a> There's a <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20031220163706/http://www.snowbooks.com/"">snapshot</a> of our homepage from December 2003 which I have no recollection of - but there it is. Then recorded there for posterity are all the iterations thereafter: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20040613155345/http://www.snowbooks.com/"">early 2004</a>, before we had published a thing, <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20041126005809/http://www.snowbooks.com/"">2004</a>, <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20050303201511/http://www.snowbooks.com/"">2005</a>, <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20060701205343/http://www.snowbooks.com/"">2006</a>, <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20070209111504/http://www.snowbooks.com/index.html"">2007</a>. Some of the images are missing; many of the links weren't archived but it's fascinating to remember these old designs and words. 

Then I looked up what <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/*hh_/amazon.co.uk/"">Amazon.co.uk</a> looked like in 1999. Answer: not much different, but their <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20001018062323/www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/subst/misc/jobs/index.html"">recruitment page </a>from 1999 is a hoot. ""Founded just five years ago, Amazon.com is the leading online retailer of books and music and one of the most widely used and cited commerce sites on the World Wide Web."" I wonder if they still do this: ""Stock options are awarded to every employee that we hire to promote a sense of ownership, focus activity on critical business issues and reward us all in the event of long-term success."" Pity about 2001, eh. 

I also looked at google. Here's their <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/19981111184551/http://google.com/"">prototype page</a> from 1998. Here's their <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/19990125084553/alpha.google.com/"">beta page </a>from 1999. This stuff makes me tingle! It's proper history, but so recent. 

I think we should do a book on this - but to be honest, it's much more fun to see these sites in situ, on a screen. It's amazing. Hours of fun for all.

Call me selfish perhaps, but I have a me-centric idea for a solution to Em's (and my) weather dilemma. Hot weather is nice, but I can't stand more than a few days of it before I want a break. Not unreasonable if you think about it. The same is true of many other things too, so why should the weather be allowed to get stuck in a monotonous rut? I mean you wouldn't want even your favourite food for <em>every</em> meal (unless it was ice cream, of course). My solution? Wobble the Earth on its axis so that instead of 365 days, a year takes a week, or maybe two. We might also have to lay the Earth over on its side a little more to accentuate the seasons, because otherwise they might not kick in quickly enough. But the upshot should be a couple of days of scorching sunshine followed by a nice, refreshing snowfall. The precessing of the Earth's axis might have to be rather abrupt because you want that snow to kick in quickly, like a cold drink after a hot afternoon, so there is some risk of shaking the Earth to pieces, but if we're not planning to fix the whole man-made climate change thing, then what have we got to lose?","","","","","2008-07-28","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

It's about man-made climate change and the grubby power politics that slow our response to the problem. It's neatly written and capably acted, with a very solid cast. Despite unhurried pacing, it's good meaty stuff with occasional high points that hold the attention (well, mine at any rate). It's the sort of drama I wish there were a lot more of (even if we set aside its worthy intentions). What's extremely depressing is the audience viewing figures for the second instalment:

...and one invoice stands out. It's for 587.50 - not a small sum, indeed greater than my monthly salary - and it's for promotional support for a work of fiction published this summer. Promotional support, to the uninitiated, is the amount of money a publisher pays to a retailer to cover the costs of promoting a title. You and I both know that whilst it does cover some of the costs, it's a rather blunt instrument (it's a flat rate, so it's not like retailers calculate the actual costs each time). This particular invoice covers one week's front of store promotion in a chain retailer. 

Having worked in retail for most of my adult life, I know that it's impossible to get all stores to do what you want them to do, at the right time. And for a promotion that lasts only a week, a retailer would have to be pretty world class to get all the stock in the right place, displayed correctly, stickered correctly and on sale. I bet that only half the stores were running the promotion on Day 1. I bet that 30% of stores never had the stock out at all. 

What am I saying? I don't really know. I'm not ever going to stop supporting retailers - they make our business viable - they are our cherished customers. And having worked in most retail functions, including stores, I have every sympathy with the challenges they face. I guess all I'm saying is that 587.50 is a lot of money, but I don't think we'll necessarily have got what we paid for. Remember my story about Xmas 2006, where we experienced 19% promotional compliance? (i.e. stock was only visible in 19% of the places it should have been.) Our business can flourish on the trading terms we have down on paper. It's just real life that gets in the way sometimes.","","","","","2008-07-31","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Poor <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jul/31/hacking.hitechcrime"">Gary McKinnon</a>. An unemployed IT worker from North London, he hacked into the Pentagon and looked for evidence that the government knows about aliens. (Which is interesting, because he always looks like a vulcan to me.) He actually thinks he <a href=""http://www.projectcamelot.org/gary_mckinnon.html"">found some</a> - but while he was rooting around he left a few messages on people's desktops. One said 'Your security is really crap'. That seems to be the extent of his crimes. But he's to be extradited to the U.S. so that they prosecute him for imperilling their national security. And apparently he caused $700,000 of damage. Though I've seen plenty of instances of how calculations like that are performed and I've yet to see one that isn't nonsense. They're probably including the cost of patching their own faulty security in that estimate. Anyway, sentences of 70 years are being mentioned (plus sketchy references to the death penalty). Thanks to Gary the Pentagon's security is now more secure and no one got hurt - just as he intended. If only he'd been sensible and killed someone. He'd be looking at a fraction of the jail time.","","","","","2008-08-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Really getting freaked out as I keep reading estimates of how we've only got seven or so years to re-structure our industries and lifestyles if we're to avoid really cataclysmic climate-related damage. We should be seeing huge changes to our economies underway and there's no sign of them. Just out of interest, are any of the readers of this blog doubtful about the threat of man-made climate change? I'm not planning to ridicule you; I'm just interested to know if anyone feels the case has not been made yet? And if so, would you say the main reason you're not convinced there's a man-made apocalypse in the offing is that if there were, surely everyone would be talking about it and the government would be acting?","<em>Update:</em> I genuinely appreciate the comments so far. Can I ask for more info, though. It seems to me that almost every industry and government would much prefer to carry on as they do now, so I can't see there being much ulterior motive for a climate change scam. Whereas I acknowledge scientists are more likely to get a grant if they scare people. So is it mainly scientists chasing grant money that's caused so many of them to claim this thing is real? Why so many scientific studies saying man-made climate change is happening if it's not?","","","","2008-08-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","19"

I have to say I've been stunned by the comments to Rob's climate change post, which broadly say 'there's not much wrong'. It's shaken me because if you and I feel so differently, what can I say - about anything - that's going to resonate with you? So I find myself a bit short of things to say, because I have to recalibrate who I thought I was talking to. Instead of writing, then, here's a list of the webtools I use in my everyday life.","First up, <a href=""http://www.rememberthemilk.com"">rememberthemilk.com</a>. I've mentioned it before, but it is my structure, my sanity, my salvation. I have 15 lists on it ranging from Snowbooks Company, Snowbooks Titles and Snowangels to Personal, Things to Chase Up, and Things To Do One Day. It's free, but if you love it to bits you can upgrade to give them $15 a year. 

Next, Firefox's web developer plug in. I only use this when reviewing our website, or building other people's, or spying on other people's (if I find a particuarly nice site I want to see how it works) and then it's indispensable. You can display the CSS (the code that defines the layout) of any page; .you can outline anything you like, ranging from images to headings; you can display things like links and divs; you can hide elements like images. It's amazing. Also free - google 'firefox plug in web developer'. 

To run the Snowblog, we use Movable Type. It's fine and dandy and does the job, although it does something weird to commenters every now and again. I suppose we could upgrade, but the chances of something going catastrophically wrong are always present, and it's kind of low on the priority list. Nowadays, when I build new blogs for people, I install <a href=""http://Wordpress.org"">Wordpress</a>. It takes no time at all, it's pretty and robust and runs on mySQL databases which tend to be supported by most people's hosting package. It's free (are you discerning a trend, here?) 

For tinkering with code of any kind, like XML (ONIX), XSL, HTML or even Java if I'm feeling very brave indeed I use <a href=""http://www.contexteditor.org/index.html"">ConTEXT.</a> It's a free text editor that I like because it colours different elements in different colours and I like the layout. If I'm getting really serious, though, I'll use <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"">Eclipse </a>(free) which is much more robust - in fact there's nothing it doesn't support, for my level of programming - but is overkill if I just want to change a few lines. You also need <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp"">Java </a> to run Eclipse. 

I use a few Yahoo Widgets. I have a job timer (helpful for doing boring tasks like bank recs that I want to speed through. I set myself a goal of getting them done quicker than the last one, then use the Yahoo timer to time myself. I did the last one in 44 minutes - w00t!) There are gazillions of widgets for every eventuality, from time management to personal organisation. <a href=""http://widgets.yahoo.com/"">Worth a browse. </a>

I use iGoogle to track blogs and newsfeeds. From the Google homepage, click on Sign In in the top right corner and use your gmail account (which everyone should have, just for convenience) to sign in. I decorate mine with an artist theme (link at the top of the page) and have a newsfeed, the Bookseller's feed and a smattering of blog RSS feeds. I only have four blogs I'm tracking at the moment because I've just had a cull - I was reading 25 a day and it was getting silly.  

That's probably all. Needless to say I use lots of other software, but it tends to be the paying kind - as you have noticed, every one of the tools above is free.","","","","2008-08-05","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Hasn't this been fascinating? Lots of detailed replies to <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/08/selffulfilling_lack_of_prophec.html"">my question</a> about man-made climate change and those who doubt its reality. Given that so many people are working hard to begin a process that will turn the planet's economy upside-down in order to reduce CO2 emissions, and given that based on our little sample plenty of people think the whole idea is bunk, it seems like there's still a lot of work to be done on establishing the facts. I thought this debate had been settled and we were all just ignoring the inevitable. But it seems like the debate still needs to happen. Every bit of evidence that any of us have heard needs to be dragged out in public and affirmed, or debunked, and then placed in its appropriate pigeon hole in the consensus view of what's going on. Because we clearly need a consensus view of what's going on, and not just six billion different variations on anecdote, instinct, analysis and trust.","I've been taught the basics of mathematical modelling once when I studied physics, once when I studied physical chemistry and again when I worked as a business analyst, and I can say this for sure: those models are best left to the experts. If our faith, or lack of it, in current climate predictions hinges on our own personal assessment of someone else's mathematical model then I think we're all in big trouble. No, all of us are going to have to trust someone on this - to be swayed by people we've decided are experts (unless we plan to train as climatologists). It seems very clear to me that this argument needs to be had in public, in detail, right now. We need every theory about sun spots or medieval warming or feedback mechanisms or ocean temperature trends to be given a proper airing, where all of us can watch if we please, so that we're clear on the transparency and rigour of any findings. Not only do we need to get the strongest consensus we can; we also need to do it in full view, so that no one feels anything has been covered up or brushed aside. I would think everyone - those who think we must act now, as well as though who are certain that there's no need - would all agree this needs to be publicly settled very quickly. Any thoughts on how we could all end up broadly agreeing about what's happening? (Clearly deciding what to do about it will be much more contentious.)","","","","2008-08-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

So it's just conceivable (geddit) that in as little as six weeks I will have a baby. Could be as long as ten weeks, of course, but point is it's rather soon. Read on for the latest update on how this will affect Snowbooks.","As I've said before, I'm not planning on taking any official maternity leave and will be working up until the birth. My chiropractor asked me yesterday when I was stopping, and I said I wasn't, and she said 'oh, but you'll be deskbound'. I had to admit that the only alternative would be that I'd be sofa-bound, so probably sitting up straight at a desk, exercising my fingers at least, is an improvement. Since I'll be needing to check my emails daily, this means I can't claim any maternity benefits. Anyone out there who wants to give this charitable case some pin money, feel free. 

I'm working from home exclusively from now on until at least December. 

Post: all post is currently being redirected from our London office to my home. Please continue to post any paper matter to 120 Pentonville Road. Any post that isn't redirected by the post office (you know what they're like) is kindly being forwarded by Kogan Page, our benevolent landlords. 

Phone: for a while Snowbooks' number has been my mobile, so there's no change there. However, I really do prefer to communicate via email. 

Customers (booktrade): Allison and Busby manage Snowbooks' sales. Please contact Susie or Lesley at <a href=""http://www.allisonandbusby.com"">A&B </a>and they'll be more than happy to help. Direct orders can be placed with our distributor, LBS, on 01903 828800. That said, I am <em>always</em> ready and available to talk to customers, regardless of how many nappies need washing, so please don't hesitate to get in touch if you need to. 

Customers (SnowAngels): Please continue to email me with all ongoing and future work requests, and I'll either get them done or ask for support from Anna and Rob. 

Authors and agents: Authors with whom I have an ongoing conversation at the moment - for instance, if I'm doing your cover design or am your editor - should continue to email me, but, when it's announced here that I've given birth, should email Anna (anna [at] snowbooks. com) if you want a reply within the week. If I'm not actively doing your cover design and edits, Anna should be emailed with all queries, gossip, updates and so forth. She'll let me know if there's anything I should know - no need to copy me. Anna lives in the US, so communication with her is email based and she's not going to answer immediately if you email at 9am GMT since she's still in bed, it being 3am her time. And it would be really helpful if all communication with me can be email based, too - not just because of Baby Rowan but because that makes it possible for us to manage the more than 60 authors we have (not to mention agents). 

Prospective authors: continue to use the manuscripts@snowbooks.com email to send your mss in. Anna is the primary reader so there will be no material delay in us reading your ms as a result of me having a baby. 

Prospective employees, work experience people, etc: you most likely won't read this but just in case you are - I'm afraid we're not hiring, or running any kind of work experience programme, unless you want it to consist entirely of changing nappies and hoovering my house. 

Suppliers: please email me with all queries as Rob and Anna will be reading my email and if there's anything I personally need to attend to urgently that they don't know about, they'll let me know. Note that our sole printers are Haynes and so we won't be interested in moving our print elsewhere. 

I'm hoping that I can take it pretty easy on the work front for at least 6 weeks. I'll be planning on keeping my side of things ticking over - the finances, SnowAngels, print, PR, emails etc - but I'll be leaning a lot on Anna and Rob, so do be gentle with them both and bear in mind that their workload will be heightened. 

Thanks for all your understanding and support!","","","","2008-08-05","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

No gems of wisdom here, I'm afraid. I'm after your ideas.","So I'm all for planning. I like to know what's happening, quite far in advance; I like to be ready, and to have everything under control. But there are curve balls that affect the running of a small business / small publisher. Here's the list I have in mind at the moment:

- returns
- sales 
- suppliers going bust
- customers dramatically changing their MO
- cash collections

So for instance, I would love to be able to forecast, reasonably accurately, when and to what extent books are going to be returned. I don't mind if they're high (well I do, of course) but if I know a few months in advance I can prepare for it. At the moment, though, I just get completely random emails not linked to time or promotions or pub date or anything - truly random - requesting returns from retailers and wholesalers. 

Another example - sales. Oftentimes I don't know whether a retailer is going to promote a title until after we've gone to print. It's bonkers! 

There are lots and lots of other examples of real life getting in the way of smooth business planning. So I'm asking you other small business managers out there - retailers, publishers and others alike - how do you do it?","","","","2008-08-06","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","7"

They're peaceful (which I feel Jesus was more than clear about) and tolerant, and egalitarian and non-hierarchical and all in all pretty groovy. What's more, their beliefs fit pretty well with what I thought Christianity was all about when I attended lots of Sunday School: peace, love, acceptance, humility and being a good egg. And check this Wikepedia excerpt out: ""many Quakers believe that the depth of [a] loving relationship is more important than [the] genders involved"". Now that's some good religion. Not sure about the god aspect, but everything else gets a thumbs-up. They even eschew designer labels. I think Quakers are people I could really respect. Assuming my endorsement counts for anything.

*Though goodness knows you can't avoid upsetting some religious group whatever you believe. Oops, there I go again.","","","","","2008-08-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

I wish I could remember exactly the logical granny-knot my teachers used to tie themselves in when explaining what's so great about the Olympic Games. There was something about nations setting aside their petty differences and their pointless vying in order to scrabble for national glory in a range of slightly exotic sports - although it was never clear to me that they couldn't do both at the same time (or even the latter as a seamless extension of the former). And then there was something about how great it was to watch amateurs competing for once, instead of people who had dedicated their lives and careers to the sport. Of course that stipulation has now gone and achieving appropriate amateur status is as simple as saying 'I want to win a medal'.","Anyway, why am I being such a sourpuss? Probably because I've always been rubbish at sport and find it boring to look at - as well as suspecting it's a brilliant trick to distract 90% of military age men from marching on Whitehall and/or the CBI and demanding a few changes. The one pleasure I do get out of the games is wondering what would happen to the viewing figures if - as in the original games - contestants competed in the nude. Are straight men now so homophobic that they couldn't watch naked blokes doing <em>anything </em>just in case someone thought they were ogling? Probably. Some viewers would drop out; others would tune in for the first time. It's probably worth trying it once just to see. Perhaps in East London in 2012.","","","","2008-08-09","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Well that was fun. A weekend lying on the sofa in varying degrees of pain as my bump exerts its ever-growing pressure on a range of ligaments, arteries and organs. I read (""Childbirth Without Fear"" by Grantly Dick-Read, written in 1942, still relevant, except perhaps for the advice on how to suspend your stockings during your confinement) and knitted (bobble hat, in the round, drove me crazy, never tackling socks), but it wasn't particularly enjoyable. I should have sat at my desk - I have an excellent office chair which seems to make everything settle down. But no, the siren call of leisure smashed me into the rocks. Hey ho. 

Anyway, whilst lying there, I was musing on lists. You know my view on them - I think lists are a very fine thing indeed. Life wouldn't run at all well without them. But I thought about a terrible flaw in a life of lists, and it is this: if it's not on the list, it doesn't get done.","Sounds simple enough to fix - put everything you want to do on the list and it'll get done. Easy, right? Well, it dawned on me that there are certain things that require a bit of inspiration, an elemental spark. I got to worrying that if I don't have a task on my list that says 'spend 30 minutes coming up with genius new ideas', that it won't happen. 

There's no point in saying 'don't be so dependent on the list.' Too late. So I resolve to put things on my list that break me away from my list for a while. Today, for instance, I have down to 'analyse the way I make print quantity decisions'. Yes, I KNOW, boring, but it's the only example I have to hand of stepping back, looking at something from a new angle, and not getting bogged down in the day to day minutiae of stuff. 

Also, one last big up for lists. They take care of all the run of the mill, often repetitive bits and bobs that always need doing, and by taking care of them it's more likely that you'll have more time and space in your head to spend pondering the really interesting things in work and life. Like WHAT can that baby possibly be leaning on to make THAT part of me hurt so much?","","","","2008-08-11","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Aside from the Wicker Basket of Shame which you were introduced to a few weeks back re: domestic filing, I have a further, deeper affliction. I have a relatively addictive personality and whilst I work hard to make sure that doesn't manifest itself in really bad ways (step away from the online gambling and G&Ts, Barnes), I do have weak spots which I indulge. One of those is collecting domain names.","I know, sounds innocuous. But it's got to the stage where I own more domain names - eighty - than I can ever build websites for.

Most, in fairness, are to do with Snowbooks, but that's because it's hard to see where I end and Snowbooks begins, oftentimes. (Indeed, Rob's first cry when I update him on our cash position if it's bad is 'Embezzeller! Embezzeller!' (deliberate phonetic spelling). I don't  - it's not true and he can't prove it anyway because I do the accounts. Hahaahaha.) 

Anyway, those domain names. As I say, many are Snowbooks related, like city-cycling.com, crafterscompanion.org, historicalnovels.org, i-2-i.org (remember that?) and of course every variation on snowbooks.com that I can think of, you know, for when we are big in Malawi and need a suitable domain suffix.

Others are me buying domains which should really have been bought already by other people, like bookindustrycommunication.com, bookonix.com, onix4books.com, ipodbk.com, fictionfiction.com, kindlethebook.com and onixcentral.com. I don't need them, but I like to have them.  

Others are becase I think they're pretty. I know, sad. But codicology.co.uk, oi0io.com, oi8io.com, koobbook.com, nixtopia.com and snowpod.co.uk are nice to look at!

Yet others I bought intending honestly to do something with. onemillionreviews.com would be cool if I ever did it. lovezombies.org, lovevampires.org, love2cycle.co.uk and mortvivant.org would all be good ideas if I hadn't realised that no one wants a business trying to create a community. If a community exists, give 'em what they find useful - but don't try to get down with the kids, it's just embarrassing. onixopolis.com was a good one, though - it was intended to be a free tool for publishers to enter bibliographic data on a webform and get an ONIX file back in return. Should have done something with that, and would have done but we didn't get the 3000 Arts Council grant we applied for to make it happen! 

Some I did actually do something with. <a href=""http://www.bookbackers.co.uk"">bookbackers.co.uk</a> has a description of our idea for a new way of publishing from earlier this year. <a href=""http://www.thepubbench.com"">thepubbench.com</a> got built and still runs. <a href=""http://www.snow-angels.org"">snow-angels.org</a>, <a href=""http://www.love2fight.com"">love2fight.com</a> (woefully out of date, must see to that), and <a href=""http://www.cookingwithbooze.org"">cookingwithbooze.org</a> (built and run by James Bridle, author of the book, with awesome videos illustrating the recipes which are well worth a look) all came to something. 

And there are plenty more. Erg. At least I use an ultra cheap US domain vendor. Still, if I can't use domain names nicely I shouldn't be allowed to have them at all. They are just so moreish...","","","","2008-08-13","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

I found one, who turned out to be crap (not returning calls or emails, overpriced) and at the last minute googled to find Pelaw. I gave them a ring, said I needed a slipcase doing within the week, and would they oblige? They have been nothing but attentive, responsive and organised since. True, there was a slight hiccup with the die, but they kept me informed and we worked to resolve the issue. The final delivery has been made and the slipcases are spot on - even the delivery driver was charming.

<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/madeleinebunting"">An article</a> in today's Guardian talks about the high social price paid in Nordic countries for their amazing social programmes. The downside is that everyone is bound by a strict set of cultural rules which would be stifling and alien to most Britons. But the glimpses the article gives of specifics suggest they're not rules, as such, but principles: respect for each other and a determination to foster the common good. It sounds fantastic. And their reluctance to accept outsiders who don't want to abide by those rules could almost be called racism, the author points out. Well, that's not my definition of racism at all. The one example given of why this strictness is a problem is that the author, a Brit, was the only one whose family was running riot in a Finnish restaurant. Imagine, giving up the freedom to behave inconsiderately in exchange for a measly efficient and benevolent state. Pah. But what if you already happen to be the sort of person who thinks it's appropriate to keep your voice down in restaurants and to generally limit your own behaviour so as not to inconvenience or intrude on others?

Lately, one of the books Ive been visiting in my spare moments has been the semi-classic <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0465067107/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1219130395&sr=8-1"">Design of Everyday Things</a> by Donald A. Norman. Theres something very satisfying about reading the catalogue of bad designs which led D. Norman to put quill to parchment. Less thrilling, but rather unsurprising, is that what prompted Donald to begin the book was an extended stay in Britain where he was regularly baffled by which light-switch controlled which set of lights, or which combination of button pushes would put a telephone caller on hold. Youd think, like a stand-up comedian doing a routine about the difference between cats and dogs, there wouldnt be much to say about the design of taps, light-switches, phone keypads and door knobs  but actually this book, which is now twenty years old, is full of critical observations which still apply and simple recommendations which still need taking up.","Unfortunately, that twenty year delay across which Donalds words are reaching us means his scorn is frequently ladled upon video recorders, cassette decks and computers which give you a more or less blank screen when you start them up. He tackles the eternal problem of the right height for a typewriter desk. Hes right to imagine that one day an undo function would make computers less frustrating to use, hes farsighted to imagine that the Apple Macintosh might hint at a more user-friendly interface, but its difficult to read anyones advice on software design after theyve felt the need to explain what a mouse is and what you do with it. But (and you might have to take my word for this) theres quite a bit of fun to be had re-imagining plumbing, electrical and interior design bad habits  once youve read what he has to say about doors, youll be all set to design your own  but I recommend skipping over any mention of consumer electronics or computing. In 2002, when Donald Norman took a look at the first edition, he decided that all it needed was a more up-to-date introduction. He even changed the title on the front cover without feeling the need to do a search-and-replace on the text itself. What he really should have done was to roll his sleeves up and drag the manuscript in to the twenty-first century. But given that he hasnt, you can still have quite a bit of fun with the original edition.","","","","2008-08-19","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Problem solving, when the problems arent too grievous or pressing, can be fun. Provided youve got a metaphorical easy-chair to recline in and a figurative pipe to puff upon, then thinking up neat solutions to whatever pickles you encounter in daily life can be every bit as rewarding as tackling crosswords, blurting out the answers to University Challenge questions or dreaming up revenge fantasies. Unfortunately, when the problem has a social dimension, theres a temptation to come up with solutions that are a little bit mischievous.","To give the example thats currently flickering at the periphery of my attention, Im thinking of dropping in to a local bookshop to chat to the owners. I have met them on many occasions and have spoken to them at length. Em and I have taken them in free books, Ive sought their advice on <em>[deleted]</em>* and even discussed collaborating on a book with them. In total perhaps weve talked with them for two and a half hours in our various meetings, and on each occasion the first few minutes are taken up with reminding them who on earth I am. To the best of their knowledge, each meeting is the first. Even hinting that this is how the last half dozen conversations have begun hasnt helped, and I confess this is where the mischievous part of my brain comes into play. What is needed, it insists, is an encounter thats properly memorable: something so outrageous or eccentric that the next time we bump into each other therell be no need for a seventh introduction; theyll remember perfectly well who I am. Is this the impulse that leads people to wear colourful bow-ties, brightly coloured braces or florid and clashing waistcoats? Those tactics might work, but Id like to try something a little more dramatic. Maybe wearing a magicians cape and concluding conversations by disappearing in a puff of stage smoke? Or would it be in poor taste to pretend to have Tourettes? And would the excuse Im on my way to a fun run fail to fully assuage their curiosity if whenever we met I was dressed as a giant fox? In reality Ill probably just continue to repeatedly introduce myself, but that doesnt stop me having fun inventing gaudily theatrical ways of being a little less forgettable.

About the new site design, that is? Too spare? Or nice and clean? I thought the basic background could be quite low key so that when pictures and cover designs appear, they are the centre of attention. Is the font legible to everyone? Rob sent me through an idea for a lovely, delicate design yesterday, which made me think 'ooh, site redesign!', but when I started tinkering I couldn't get his lovely light design to look right and it evolved into this. I am less a designer, more a grand tinkerer. 

Anyway, thoughts very much welcome. The only changes have been to the CSS and the images so it's a snap to tweak and fiddle. I use Firefox's Developer plug in to 'Edit CSS' in a live browser, so I can see immediately what the changes I make look like. Then I copy and paste that revision into a new doc and upload it. The only thing is you have to be very careful not to hit 'refresh' after tinkering for an hour, as I found yesterday...! 

And of course, doing a redesign was a displacement activity to actually uploading some new content for our forthcoming books (which is also very easy, but I got sidetracked by the pretty colours). So those enticing new covers you see in the header up there? More news to come on them later in the day!","","","","","2008-08-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","13"

Hey there -- it's Not-Often-Heard-From-Anna.  It seems to me that whenever I make my presence known in the form of a Snowblog post, it's always because I have something to complain about.  But not this time!

See, a friend of mine recently became <s>unemployed</s> freelance, and he was having a difficult time giving structure to his days.  Knowing that I work from home, he asked me about my daily routine.  I blinked a few times and then tried this new word out for myself. 'Routine?'

It turns out that some people are suited for working from home and some just aren't.  And despite my utter lack of routine, I am <i>definitely</i> a work-from-home sort of person...","It's a bit cheaty to say that I have NO daily routine -- but the scheduled events in my life don't have much to do with publishing (they have everything to do with food, in case you were wondering).  I explained my work-from-home philosophy to my friend thusly: Everything I do is work.  

In any given day, I have to run errands, take care of the garden, cook meals, tidy the house, make books, etc, etc.  Only one of those actually brings in money, but they all have to get done.  It makes no difference to the outside world if I decide to do one before the other, as long as all my tasks are completed when they need to be.  Sometimes I can sit at the computer for hours, working on a cover design, but other times I only manage to proofread ten pages of text before I flit outside to see if there are beans to pick for dinner.

The sort of work I do really lends itself to my approach.  There are deadlines to meet, and as long as I'm meeting them, everything runs smoothly.  I think my friend was a bit thanks-for-nothing after my explanation, since he was trying to come up with stories to pitch for radio -- something which takes much more 'push' than what I do.  I imagine he would have done much better chatting with Em, who's driven in ways I might never understand.

So I wonder about other people.  If you work in an office, are you one of those people who says, 'Ooh, I could NEVER work from home!' or do you think you would thrive on the lack of official structure?  I certainly find that writing is best done on some sort of schedule, but are there authors out there who sit down and write whenever the urge strikes?

As for me, I'm on a big proofreading binge right now, so I suppose I should scuttle back to that. . . maybe after I check for ripe tomatoes.","","","","2008-08-28","2013-03-29","","","","Anna","10"

There's been <a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/news/65910-borders-rejigs-buying-team.html"">news this week</a> of the 'rejigging' of the Borders buying team. I feel for anyone going through organisational changes, simply because it's stressful and distracting, so wish everyone who's going, and staying, well. 

But it reminded me of a point Rob first made ooh, about 12 years ago, because, in the press release announcing the news, Borders' Head Office was referred to not as the Head Office but as the Store Support Office.","That, of course, is what retailers for the last twenty years at least have insisted is the shape of their companies - stores are the sharp end and all those well meaning folk from Head Office are just there to support them. Sometimes it's true. Usually, though, when I was a buyer, I used to wish that stores would just bloomin' well do as they were told because if the company gives the buyer a 20m sales budget to meet, but stores are allowed to do their own thing, the role becomes untenable, quickly. 

Anyway, Rob's point was this. If Head Office is there to support stores, why isn't it staffed at the weekend and bank holidays, with a freeze on vacations over the Easter and August peak seasonal events and double staffed over Christmas? Aren't these the busiest times, the times when stores need support the most? And surely the point becomes even more relevant if you actually call your Head Office the Store Support Office... 

Or, in fact, do stores work best when they're busy serving customers without emails, faxes, dictates, reminders, bulletins, allocation reports, sales challenges, and bits of paper marked 'JFDI'* in the top right hand corner (like the Ops director at Superdrug used to use) arriving every quarter of an hour?

Personally, I think that if stores were doing as good a job as they have to  in the first place, and if head office were organised sufficiently far in advance that there were no last minute changes of plan, there would be no need for all the bits of extra paper - but I'm a weird hybrid of an ex-store manager and ex-buyer, so can see both sides. 

Makes you think, anyway.

I've been a bit wrapped up in other things lately and I haven't even been <em>trying </em>to entertain the baying horde of SnowBlog fans out there in InternetLand. Sorry about that. I've decided to see whether I can write screenplays and naturally, to ease myself in gently, I thought I'd create a TV series. Initially I broke my own rule and truncated the planning process before I knew <em>exactly</em> where everything was going because I wanted to get some scenes written and I thought I could learn more about my characters by letting them interact. I'm not unhappy with the results, but I realise I <em>am </em>unhappy not knowing what happens next. Especially in a screenplay, there's not room to have too many standalone scenes or character moments which don't also advance the overall story - which you can't do unless it's already mapped out. So I'm back to planning again and while it's not fun it feels a lot more comfortable. Like eating your vegetables before you tuck into the ice cream. Not instant gratification, but probably what you'd  wish you'd done all along if you don't do it. Anyway, while that's taking up my time I might write fewer blog posts. Perhaps I can offset that with bribes. I've got a few duplicate DVDs in my collection and I thought I might rehome them. First, is a copy of the fabulous and strange <em>Dark City</em>. Let me know why I should send it to you and the best suggestion wins.","<em>Update:</em>

When my son says to me, in six years time, 'Mummy, tell me about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse"">data warehouses</a>,' I shall settle down in the sofa next to him, adopt a far-away gaze, and launch into a story that would vie with any other piece of barely-comprehendable nostalgia. And he will gasp with wonderment and say 'but surely you didn't have to wait more than five minutes for a report to run? And why was defining a set of report parameters so clunky? And why, why did every keystroke hang the computer for minutes at a time?' And I'll say to him, 'Son, in those dark days you had to shoulder all sorts of unspeakable burdens to get access to perfectly straightforward data. Consider yourself blessed that you live in the post-Data Warehouse age.' And he will look relieved, and go off to jack in to his super-cool 3D virtual game pod.

Below the cut because it's too boring for normal consumption.","But honestly. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse"">data warehouse</a> 'upgrade' I mentioned? So much of the data has magically, and subtley, changed. If you are a human, for instance, (as opposed to a computer) you might not think there's much difference between this record: 

Spectral Crossings - 9781905005918 - 01/Oct/08 - Paperback

and this:

Spectral Crossings-9781905005918-1/10/2008-Paperback

But there is! There is a universe of difference! Because the first has spaces either side of the hyphens, and the second doesn't, and the date format has completely changed. So now I have to update all my Access records to reflect their changes, so my Access queries can match their dumb layout (why there isn't a plain ISBN13 field available I cannot say). 

It just incenses me that someone's done an upgrade, assumed that all their users are too dumb to actually want to manipulate their data in any way and now I've got a twenty minute task to add to my workload. I know, it's not much, but I've got better things to do than track down and fix bugs like this. It's really irritiating that people can make blanket changes without either appreciating the knock on effect of their actions or informing users of the changes they're making.

"41856","","1","RNC Arrests","Publish","true","","I'm a bit of a fan of <a href=""http://www.democracynow.org/"">Democracy Now</a>, a daily news programme from the States. Its host, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_goodman"">Amy Goodman</a>, was one of those dragged away by the police outside the Republican National Convention in St Paul this week. You can see a video of it <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYjyvkR0bGQ"">here</a>. She and her colleagues had their press credentials on display, as well as their passes to get into the convention, but they were still arrested. What's a little bit scary about that sort of thing, even beyond the idea that protesting can be treated as a crime, is what happens once you've been arrested, because it's all shades of guilt after that.

If there are violent protesters in a crowd, then the whole crowd is suspect. And if the whole crowd is suspect, then so are the reporters covering the event. And of course, once you're arrested, you're treated like a criminal. And since a lot of criminals are uncooperative, sometimes violently so, there seems nothing wrong with knocking them down, bellowing at them to shut up  and tightening their handcuffs if they make a fuss. But of course, when the 'fuss' they're making is to explain that they are accredited press, the bellowing and rough treatment seems positively barbaric. And once they've been arrested, it seems sensible to charge them with something, so Amy Goodman will be charged with Interfering with a Peace Officer, and her colleagues with Probable Cause Riot. 

It seems doubtful to me that hers will come to court, given Amy's high profile, the heaps of journalism awards she's received for being good at her job, and the fact that her arrest was caught on video, meaning that over 400,000 YouTube viewers have seen her <em>not</em> interfering with a Peace Officer. Her colleagues' chances are less good, despite it being fairly obvious that a professional reporter carrying a camera is unlikely to be a rioter. But for any ordinary citizens caught up in the arrests, whose only real crime is a desire to protest the wreck the Republican Party has made of America, the prospects are probably a lot worse.

The only lighter moment was that one of the reporters arrested was from the New York Post who apparently protested without success, ""But I'm with a <em>Republican</em> newspaper.""","","","","2008-09-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","10"

It's a strange thing, language. On the one hand I find myself wanting to understand all its rules and struggling to enjoy the sort of prose which talks about 'less mistakes' or 'if I was to make a mistake'. So much so that I found myself writing a text message the other day and looking for the semi-colon key; nothing else would quite do. On the other hand, those of us who write or work with books for a living often forget that language is old and books are new, so the written word cannot possibly be at the heart of language in the way the spoken word is.","While books explaining and emphasising the rules of English are popular, they're not nearly as interesting as books exploring the evolution and the continual metamorphosis of language. It's fascinating, at least to me, how languages divide and combine, and the forms they can take. Pidgins and creoles spring up and diverge from the parent languages that their vocabularies are sourced from. And the 'rules' of English have constantly shifted.

Yes, standardisation is important and we all like to know whether a sentence is 'correct' or not, but really, it is rather haughty to believe that there are people who can't speak their native language 'properly'. They may not speak it according to the accepted 'rules', but everyone speaks grammatically by their own set of rules, and almost always by the rules of their native linguistic community too. I've written before about how for a while, the language of Aquitaine was the noble French, until the capital moved North and it was reclassified as a peasant tongue. I've also talked about how saying 'I was, you was, he/she was' for the singular and 'we were, you were, they were' for the plural is the logical way to speak given the history of our language, but accidents happen, and slightly weird dialects - which happen to be spoken by the minority in charge - end up outlawing the perfectly consistant and sensible usages of the low-status majority. And as for 'rules' like not ending a sentence with a preposition or splitting an infinitive, does anyone really believe that they are important, necessary or a real aid to communication?

To learn heaps more, I heartily recommend dipping into John Mc Whorter's <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-Babel-Natural-History-Language/dp/006052085X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1220604758&sr=8-1"">The Power of Babel</a> or Stephen Pinker's <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Language-Instinct-Science-Mind-Penguin/dp/0140175296/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1220604826&sr=1-4"">The Language Instinct</a>. 

It seems to me that linguistics is full of interest because it brings in knowledge of history and patterns of influence, thought and the development of our brains, the nature of communication, and teaches us about other cultures. And it is fundamentally egalitarian because no other approach makes sense. Modern English is a trade language and it's a bit of a mess, with the withered remnants of a defunct case system; it's littered with pieces of dead languages (like the Old English plurals: children, oxen, brethren); and most of its words aren't assembled from smaller units that make sense to us the way German is, giving it a rather opaque vocabulary. 

The languages of developed nations in general are neither impressively complex nor laudably simple. The dialects spoken by the richest and best educated communities are no more rational, accessible or distinguished by their merits than the speech of Cornish fishermen or Scottish crofters. And Standard English is neither truer to its history than most rural dialects nor more in tune with modern times than the slang-filled cant of many teenagers. There just is no basis for the historical accidents of one dialect being considered more 'correct' than popular alternatives beyond the decision of those in charge to prefer their own speech as the template for standardisation rather than someone else's. It's almost impossible to delve into linguistics without becoming more respectful of the way other people speak. Though it does also help one apply the arbitrary rules of our betters, so there's something there for everyone.","","","","2008-09-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I knew it! OK, I know I start a lot of blog posts like that, but this time I almost, practically did know it. 

When I was a teenager, and dinosaurs stalked the land, I used to lay on my front, on the living room carpet, a foot or two from the TV screen and watch Horizon, especially loving programmes devoted to quarks, black holes, the big bang or the nature of the fundamental forces. I didn't understand all (or probably much) of it, but I got just enough sense out of the explanations (and Radiophonic sound cues) to realise it was all extremely cool.","Now, after lo these many years, I know a lot more science, and I've sometimes wondered whether that's the reason modern Horizon programmes seem to me as though they're pitched at dizzy labradors rather than science fans. Perhaps they're telling me things I already know. But that doesn't really explain it. These days there's vanishingly little science content, only human interest stories and abstract visuals - which though pretty, tend to over-punctuate every programme, giving you six seconds between each utterance so that you can meticulously process the boilerplate hyperbole, e.g. ""But what was to come next was to turn those ideas upside down. It was a revelation that no one could possibly have foreseen."" Yawn. I get very tired of being given five minutes build-up to each pre-digested fact. And my suspicions about the good old days were finally confirmed when I watched <em>Lost Horizons: The Big Bang</em> at the weekend. It was a sort of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clip_show"">clip show</a> of Horizon instalments mainly from the Seventies and Eighties. And there they were, sequences of facts delivered one upon the other in a brisk but unhurried sequence. We weren't told how to feel about each one before it arrived. We didn't have to endure a mixed metaphor or even a stale cliche about how 'things would never be the same again'. Those old programs attempted to convey complex science to an intelligent audience of scientific amateurs. I knew there was a reason I used to watch it.

Now I will give modern Horizon this: it does some wonderful things with out-of-focus images of cityscapes or headlights on highways, and its mood music is often excellent; but in terms of contaminating its chilled-out bombastics with any educational content, it's become a sort of scientific muzak. Ideally I would like it to return to its original mission and stop thinking we're afraid to learn anything, but I don't suppose that's going to happen.

But at least their recent retrospective enabled me to identify the problem. You'll all be relieved to know that I haven't got incomparably smarter since I was a teenager; it's just that the BBC has decided we're all morons.","","","","2008-09-08","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Do you ever wonder, in your bleaker moments, whether the world would be better off without you? Well, I don't mean to depress you, but the answer is 'yes'. It would. Without all of us. I've been reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/World-Without-Us-Alan-Weisman/dp/0753513579/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1220878387&sr=8-1"">The World Without Us</a>, which is sort of the book precursor to that History Channel show I <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/05/battling_misanthropy.html"">mentioned a while back</a>.","The book considers the question of how long it would take for our impact on the planet to fade if we all disappeared today. And it alternates with a similar hypothetical enquiry: what if humans had never existed? But the author seems a little fidgety about sticking to the 'world without us' premise and often goes for many pages at a time without a nod towards the linking theme of the book. Instead he's busy listing all the awful things we've been getting up to. 

Even so, it's fascinating - if depressing - stuff. For a start we've created rather a lot of compounds which can't be degraded by any bug, worm, mould or form of erosion in Mother Nature's arsenal - more so than I realised. The sea is increasingly full of minuscule pellets of plastic, the ground-down remnants of bags and bottles which get smaller and smaller but never dissolve or decompose. Imagine that: oceans full of microscopic plastic sediment which gets in everywhere (including inside living creatures) and might never go away. Even bio-degradable plastics don't necessarily break down in the ocean depths.

But the book also charts our history of battering the planet, and the charge sheet goes back so much further than I realised. There's a mass extinction that's much more recent than the death of the dinosaurs and it coincides with Homo Sapiens getting the hang of hunting in packs. That's the timeframe within which all but a handful of large animals were wiped off the face of the planet. America, Europe and Australia all had their equivalents of Africa's megafauna - and Africa had a lot more of it. Monstrous giant slothes, impossibly huge mammoths, and gigantic big cats were all wiped out on a timescale which leaves our early ancestors the likeliest culprit. And like the TV program, the only melancholic comfort we can take from this history of devastation comes from observing the way in which wildlife is proliferating at Chernobyl or in the mine-strewn DMZ between North and South Korea. Ecosystems bounce back with amazing speed if humans can be removed from the picture. So if you fancy a nicely written and authoritative total downer, might I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/World-Without-Us-Alan-Weisman/dp/0753513579/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1220878387&sr=8-1"">The World Without Us</a> by Alan Weisman.","","","","2008-09-08","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

For terrorism to be effective, it has to scare a lot of people. Terrorism must cause people to quake in their boots and threaten to vote differently otherwise it's shoddy and  poor quality. Thus making fun of terrorism is a good thing. Our momentary amusement reduces our terror levels and makes us less likely to do what the terrorists want. (That said, it's still a good idea to also have a few police looking into the problem - laughter, though a powerful medicine, is rubbish at detective work).","With that in mind, I wanted to share with you my concern about the gentleman's agreement the US and UK governments have with Al Qaida (and affiliates) that the focus of future attacks will be passenger aircraft. We've already seen one act of bad faith in London, where tube trains and buses were targeted, as well as the terrible Madrid bombings which affected trains. Can we really trust Al Qaida to keep their word?

Take the men accused of trying to blow up planes with <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/sep/09/3"">liquid explosives</a>: on the face of it, that's business as usual. But a lot of people have pointed out that binary liquid explosives, where two innocuous and stable liquids are combined to make a deadly high explosive, are actually less a chemical reality and more a popular but fictional Hollywood movie plot. Yes, binary liquid explosives exist, but no, they are not made by adding either Oasis or Tang to anything. The approximate steps involved are mocked very professionally <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/17/flying_toilet_terror_labs/"">here</a>.

It's one thing to lock up a man because he wants to kill the president with a handkerchief; it's another to believe that the president's life was in danger. Planning to blow up a plane is appallingly anti-social, and fits most people's definition of evil. But it's important not to confuse how evil someone is with how much of a genius they are. Just because these would-be terrorists fit the movie stereotype of having brown skin and Arabic names doesn't mean they also have the resources and technical know-how of movie terrorists. No, much more likely is that a handful of Al Qaida wannabes were going through the motions - doing what they're supposed to by appearing to threaten airplanes - without any real capability or rigour. I mean, if I wanted to blow up a plane, I'd do it with one of those rocket launchers you balance on your shoulder... from the ground. They're kept under a lot less security than planes, and the beauty is that you don't have to show your passport - or worse still stand within the blast radius - if you want to use one.

So while it's all very well to confiscate every tube of toothpaste and pair of sewing scissors from airline passengers, a partnership needs enthusiasm and commitment on both sides if it's to work. We can double our efforts, and make everyone who even visits (or better still lives near) an airport take off their shoes, but that won't stop Al Qaida getting bored with the idea of planes and going after some much easier and more effective target. 

Planning attacks can be boring, and the temptation to inject a little novelty might become overwhelming. What if some lazy terrorist with a short attention span decides that it makes more sense to blow up the houses of parliament where the leaders of the country meet, rather than a plane-load of ordinary people? And what if they decide to use real explosives and not movie ones? (On second thoughts, it's not clear how attacking the British Parliament would have any effect on the War on Terror, but getting into America these days is too much hassle.) But still, the point is that we can't guarantee that terrorism and airline travel will always be synonymous. Anywhere people congregate is a plausible target, and given the funding that American airline companies have received for being 'on the front line' when it comes to terrorism, it's only a matter of time before other transport sectors, and then the food, entertainment and heritage industries fancy a little bit of that government-subsidised security action. Plus, to be honest, a terrorist who can make bombs out of fruit drinks probably has magical powers and won't be stopped by the grumpy and underpaid security staff who work for BAA, so why not let us have clean teeth on the flight while we work on our embroidery unhindered? After all, if a little old lady is forced to sew samplers with a disposable plastic fork and a parched throat haven't the terrorists already won?","","","","2008-09-09","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

'Passion' is a thing you're meant to have, and display in copious quantities, if you want to get a job - along with 'ambition', 'drive', being a 'self-starter' and all sorts of other qualities that have boiled themselves down to cliche through over-use. You know my view: working for other people is always an exercise in wearing a mask, and the degree to which you display management qualities is a measure of your skills as an actor. 

The passion I'm interested in, though, is the emotion I've felt since co-founding and running Snowbooks. Let's take a look at that.","There are some veins of emotion that run throughout my history with Snowbooks which have remained at about the same level of intensity. One is my fury at being conned for 10 years before the veil fell from my eyes and I saw the world of employment for what it is: an unbalanced emotional contract between the employer (who - surprise - doesn't care one jot about you, it being a corporate entity without human emotions) and the employee (who gets suckered in to believing that his life should centre around his job, and therefore is surprised and let down when, upon resigning from the job, all he gets is the modern equivalent of a carriage clock (usually a mug, some chocolate, some booze, a funny gift - perhaps novelty socks, perhaps novelty condoms, perhaps an oversized card - and never a backward glance from the company he has worked his heart out for.)

Another is my determination to prove people wrong. From the very start, most people we spoke to rolled their eyes and delivered a verdict on our business plan which didn't waver too far from 'it'll never work'. Funnily enough, many of those same people have developed selective amnesia and are big fans of Snowbooks now, which is fine - I don't mind since I was never after their approval in the first place. I don't think it's a unique attribute to feel that the more people push you back, the more you want to prove them wrong - and the greater the sense of glee when you win. 

So senses like fury and determination have remained pretty constant in my mind. But what about passion? It's an emotion of energy, something you have to keep up, something that can be as draining as it is energising. In my pregnancy, for instance, people have said 'oh, you must be so excited!' Well, not every hour of every day. I can't maintain a steady output of excitement for 9 months straight - I'd collapse. Passion could be said to share the same characteristics. 

And in musing that notion, it got me thinking. What, exactly, gets me out of bed every day? I haven't had a holiday - or even a full day off - since my honeymoon in 2005. I do at least a bit of work most weekends. My hobbies tend to be things that can benefit the business, like learning code, reading relevant books and using the internet. And I don't feel at all burned out. I don't have that sense I used to get at work of trying to gee myself up, thinking 'ok, it's the end of May now. I just have to get to August and there's another bank holiday then. I can make it. It's only three months.' 

Indeed, the feeling I get when we find a new book that we want to publish, or when a book we've just published starts to take off, or when we have a good week of sales and see backlist titles still selling well, or when people compliment us on a cover design or a way of working, is still as electrifying as ever. And on a day to day level, the sense of satisfaction I get from getting through my list, making sure everything is running smoothly, using technology to reduce the amount of time we have to spend on the dull parts of running a business, getting our books out there and selling, and revelling in the way we do things is as strong as ever. It is also bloody hard work, and hard to keep the cash coming in too - and knowing that only makes me more proud and determined. It also feels as different as ever to how I know normal companies work, and I still get very excited knowing that we cut out all the nonsense (the meetings, the office politics, the busywork, the manual data entry, the sign off procedures, the waste of money on things that make no difference) and get on with the bits that matter: the design, quality and presentation of our books. 

I know I'm going on, and you might think I'm being tiresomely self-congratulatory. I just find it incredible that here we are, five years in, and I still genuinely have this burning sense of passion about what we're doing. It's probably because I don't need to prove it to anyone that I still have it, thinking about it. If I had to argue my case at my annual appraisal, it would be a lot less convincing. 

If you don't feel passionate about your job, your life, the way you spend your days, do consider changing it. It's the kindest thing you can possibly do for yourself. I have met some wonderful people in the last five years who run their own show, and they are remarkable and I'm sure share this genuine, long term sense of passion that I'm talking about. I'm looking at you, Mr B's team, and Mostly Books, Salt Publishing, Tom at Legend and many of the other indie publishers I know. We've done the right thing.

I've had a difficult history with advice. I used to take too much of it. The downside with that is that you're no longer making decisions based on your own understanding of what's best, so once you've done whatever you were advised to do, you have to go back and ask what's next. It's unsatisfactory. And that applies to writing as well. There's a risk that after you make the changes, as instructed, you then have to go back and ask whether you've done it right. It's no longer about your judgement. It's the difference between a bricklayer and an architect (and, apologies to bricklayers everywhere, in this scenario it's good to be the architect).","Of course being thickskinned, pigheaded, bloodyminded or oblivious isn't good either. So many problems can be avoided if more than one perspective is involved, more than one set of eyes is applied to the matter.

My solution: it's a sort of wine-tasting idea. When given advice, you should take a sip and slurp it around to get the flavour and then spit it out. If the idea is something that would have occurred to you eventually, which makes sense to you, then you should feel free to obey it. Good advice is just about saving you time, maybe years of it, in coming up with the same idea yourself. But if the advice would take you far enough from your own personal understanding of events that you'd effectively be putting yourself on an advice drip-feed forever more, then ignore it.

One of the most important aspects of decision-making is to build up your own ability to manage your life. If you're not making your own decisions, with a full understanding of the pros, cons and consequences, then you're robbing yourself not just of autonomy but of valuable experience and the opportunity to develop. That can be a bigger risk than making the odd short-term blunder.

And I think the same applies to writing. Try to see the criticism. Try to understand why the person making it feels that way. Try to imagine addressing their suggestions in a way that makes sense to you, that improves the work in your eyes as well as theirs. But if you don't get it, then stick to your guns.

Most of the all-time top-ten movies were short-term commercial failures which went on to inspire future film-makers, change lives and bring glory to those involved (not to mention making a packet via DVD sales). Movies like The Shawshank Redemption or Twelve Angry Men would not have survived the modern test-screening process intact. Diluting the vision might have made short-term popularity easier to achieve, but it would have done so at the cost of a much more influential longer-term success.

So how to resolve creative differences where an honest attempt to understand the other person's viewpoint results in stalemate? I think all sorts of situation which are treated as though there is a right and a wrong are really a lot more akin to dating. It's about finding a good match; it's not about some absolute scale of goodness or badness. Artistically, I think it's best to let people do 95% of what they want to do, exactly as they want to do it - with the understanding that you may have no interest in what they subsequently produce. But if they work that way it helps them get better at what they do and it makes your life easier. It's much easier to go out and find good work than it is to mould it out of something you don't like. And in life I think it's best to let people pursue whatever half-baked notions they have (assuming their lives aren't put at risk) because it's the best way for them to learn about themselves and what works for them. Someone who knows their own mind and what makes them happy as a result of making lots of decisions and living with the consequences stands far more chance of leading a fulfilling life than someone who's good at doing as their told. So my advice is this: listen to advice and then do your own thing.

Agree? Disagree? Got a better way of looking at it?","","","","2008-09-11","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

So, Scott Pack (over at <a href=""http://meandmybigmouth.typepad.com/"">Me and My Big Mouth</a>) has a gratis Sony Reader <a href=""http://meandmybigmouth.typepad.com/scottpack/2008/09/my-sony-reader.html"">courtesy </a>of a digital ad agency. It'll be interesting to see what he makes of it. I tend to think of Scott as equal parts quirky Amish versus up-to-the-minute trend-tracker. I seem to recall him saying he didn't watch TV (although he makes some horrible exceptions), but he's not averse to iPods (being a zealous music fan), computers and gaming paraphernalia. And he's a very prodigious reader. So I can't really predict which way he'll jump with the Sony whatsit.","It seems the first hurdle Scott has encountered has been finding books to put on the thing. I think if I were looking to make one of these devices commercially popular I'd start out by focussing on what these gadgets can do that paper and glue can't. I'd put some effort into software that could package up text for these gadgets in an easy-to-use, automagical way. That way folks like Scott, and us here, could read submissions electronically on something with a crisp, daylight-suitable display. I've spent entirely too long exporting PDFs from InDesign, copying them across to e-readers, discovering that I get eight words to the page, or eight thousand, and starting again.

I think I'd also throw a few quid in the direction of Project Gutenberg and provide a Sony Reader-friendly version of every single thing in their vast collection. And since carrying these books around costs nothing, I'd make it very easy to pop five hundred classic novels on to the Reader for those just-in-case moments. 

Then I'd approach other content providers so that free online newspapers and magazines got all the help they could need in offering Sony Reader-formatted editions. If your Reader had up-to-the-minute newspaper stories, editorials, articles, columns, features and interviews already loaded, when you got a quiet moment, you'd be sure to find something to glance at. 

Penultimately, I'd provide templates and CSS stylesheets for Blogspot and Typepad and others so that subscribing to a few dozen blogs, and reading the archives and the recent updates on your Sony Reader (in/on the bath, train, plane or bed) was cinchy.

And finally I'd create a bit of software for the Sony Reader owner to run on their home computer that makes all this functionality and content easy-peasy to access. Something along the lines of the iTunes store: just tick here, tick there, and your gadget fills up with fresh content whenever you synch it.

Given that these things are well within Sony's power - and they haven't been done (thus leaving Scott scratching around for suitable content) - does that mean Sony isn't serious yet? I've said it before, but if Apple ever decide to produce an electronic reader, it's suddenly going to become clear to a lot of those on the fence why they'd want a gadget like that. And the reason will be that Apple will make it very useful, very easy and very desirable.

I like my Sony Reader, but I wouldn't pretend it does any more than point the way towards the genuinely usable electronic books of the future.","","","","2008-09-13","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Marketing an experience is always a tricky thing. If it's something you can't get anywhere else - say an amazing theme park ride - it's difficult to explain to people what they're missing until they experience it for themselves. But if it's something more accessible, like a movie or a book, you can release snippets or summaries of it and let people work out for themselves whether they're interested. The only trouble with that is that you can find yourself giving away more and more of the plot and the experience in order to stimulate people's appetite. I've read back-cover blurbs which gave away plot twists occurring in the last fifth of a book and most of us have seen movie trailers which contain all the good bits of the movie.","That sort of marketing is very short-termist. You bring in the customers and their money, but you send them away disgruntled. By revealing too much in the advertising, you've strengthened the marketing and undermined the product itself. The marketing has become more important than the customer experience. We have a word for that in Britain: it's known as a 'swizz'.

The problem gets worse when you think about who your marketing is acting upon and how you go about swaying those people. I think of it like a target or a dartboard: there's an inner circle of people who don't need marketing to; they've already decided to be customers. Then there's people in the outermost ring who aren't going to buy your product whatever you say. Marketing, just like political campaigning or seduction techniques, is aimed at those who might be undecided.

The problem with undermining the product in favour of the marketing is that in people terms what you're doing is punishing the loyal customer in order to entice the indifferent one. That can't be the right order of priorities.

A blatant example of this faulty approach is the whole idea of Next Week On... trailers. The last thirty seconds of a TV programme is devoted to telling you as much of next week's plot and highlights as possible before you can find the remote and turn it off. (I send recordings of Doctor Who episodes to Anna in America and always edit out the 'Next Week' teasers). If I'm planning to watch it anyway, why do I want the plot twists of the first fifteen minutes revealed? So I can sit there and watch characters on screen struggle to solve mysteries I already know the answer to? No, because that's not fun. It's for all those who were wavering, who aren't really sure they like this show, who might give it one more try if next week looks promising enough. 

For those who are fans, it's rather insulting and irritating. It's akin to wandering past a queue to see The Mousetrap and shouting 'The butler did it' (except doing so back in the days before everyone knew that the butler did it). Even more annoying for me, is the five seconds before a TV show comes on, when the announcer just has time to blurt out 'And it's trouble for the team now, as Sally is kidnapped and Bob has to work out whether it's an inside job'. Arrrgggghhh! When you think of the months of work that go in to making an hour of television, the thought that a hastily scripted five-second link is allowed to spoil the surprises of the first act is baffling to me.

So what's to be done? Personally, I have three solutions to this sort of thing. One is to start a trend of honest marketing. I've said it many times before, but there's no product so great that a marketing team won't try to create a sense of anti-climax in the customer by overstating its merits. Marketing teams compete with other marketing teams to outdo each other and to grab the attention of the customer. They don't try to match customer to product (as though they were a dating agency) they say whatever they can to bag as many customers as possible (like lotharios on the pull). And in doing so they risk leaving a large number of customers feeling used, instead of making a smaller number feel special.

And secondly, business in general needs to learn to cut its cloth better. We need to learn to cater to niches and spend our budgets on that basis. Instead of always trying to attract everyone to every product, we need to create products that a subset of the populace will love and accept that the majority won't be interested. And we need to spend our money on that basis, so that we can afford to be a hit with only a slice of the total population.

And following on from that point, we should endeavour to shift the balance back towards organic growth of audience or customer base. Not everything can be a big splash and an instant success. Not everything can have a huge PR push. Let products win over their critics rather than drown them out - in fact plan for it. It's a good idea because it provides a much better quality control filter than allowing ad spend to carry the day. Retailers who promoted books praised by readers over books supported by publishers would lose short-term revenue but build longer-term custom. TV companies who counted the number of loyal viewers a program had rather than the number who tuned in for a week would end up refocusing their efforts towards niche TV that its target viewership loved rather than trying to find shows that could attract the biggest audience.

That's not to say that the huge PR splash doesn't have its place, but most of us have learned that it tells us nothing about whether we will enjoy a book or a movie. We know it's as likely to be a trick as not. So it's not as though it's a system that works particularly well as it is.

Imagine an alternate world where advertising was banned and only customer and viewer feedback was publicised. There would be a lot wrong with it, I'm sure. But struggling to find good books to read and entertaining (though possibly very low budget) TV shows to watch wouldn't be one of the drawbacks.","","","","2008-09-15","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

I seem to recall there's a cultural pendulum that swings between rationality and a sort of gothic romanticism. On the one hand you have the slightly dull but worthy view of humans as logical plodders and on the other the idea that progress comes from moments of divine inspiration. I know which is more fun, but what I've never liked about the inspiration model is that it always seems to fall for the idea that 'there's a fine line between genius and madness', that you have to be a troubled borderline schizophrenic to have a really groundbreaking idea. Right at this moment, I'd say the rationalist view is in the ascendant. It's my preferred mode, so I'm happy about that. But one area in which it falls down is via a sort of intellectual Protestant work ethic: the sense that effort equates to output and that putting in the hours is the best way to make progress. I'm not disagreeing with that as a general principle, but one needs to be aware of the exceptions. How many of the things you do each day could be automated if someone took the time and trouble to work out how? Slogging away at dull tasks takes commitment and stamina, but that doesn't mean it's always the right approach. Sometimes it's OK to take a short-cut. In fact, sometimes it's better all round.","When I was a management consultant, I did a lot of that sort of thinking. I tended to think of jobs in terms of decision points. If there were no tricky decisions being made, then in principle a task was better suited to a computer. I still feel that way, although I'm mulish about it. I'd rather spend two days programming a solution to something than half a day doing manual data entry to achieve the same thing.

For one-off tasks, that's a bit of a waste of time. But should the task recur, having an automated solution brings enormous productivity gains. And once you know you can do something automatically, you can often think of ways of putting it to new uses. There's a sort of synergy at work which means that the more automated solutions you have, the more each individual solution pays for itself.

To illustrate: Em has put a lot of effort into storing our book data in database form so that we can create <a href=""http://www.editeur.org/onix.html"">Onix messages</a>* easily. Once we've got that, creating web pages where the words are filled in from the relevant Onix messages becomes a possibility. And once we're converting Onix messages into web pages, we can convert them into data files ready to import into InDesign just as easily - which puts us in a good position to create catalogues automatically. And once we can do all that, we offer it to other people as a <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/onixcentral/index.html"">service</a>. That means that spending two days automating something that can be done manually in half a day not only begins to pay for itself, it leads to gains throughout the business and eventually turns the process of automation into a new revenue stream for the company. It's not only a hundred times more satisfying than manual data entry, it's giving a boost to pretty much everything we do.

So might I suggest a Thought for the Day? Have a quick think about what you do every day that could be automated. If you feel like it, leave a comment describing what you wish you could automate and I'll make suggestions about how you might tackle it.

And a final point to think about: I've been tinkering with computers since before there was such a thing as a PC. But Em used to hate computers. She hated maths and had no interest in programming. These days she writes her own programs and only tells me about it afterwards. Ten years ago, she had no idea how to make the simplest, two-line web page. Now she can earn money from designing gorgeous websites for others - and she can tailor a piece of software to populate that site with information about hundreds of books, a task that could take weeks but now takes seconds. Em didn't go on courses or do a computer science degree. She just read a few books, asked a lot of questions and gave it a go. The chances are that you could do the same if you wanted. You'd save time, you'd make money and you'd have fun. And the only downside is... what? Opting for a romanticist burst of inspiration in an age of predominantly rationalist plodding? That doesn't sound too bad.

If I get put in prison I think it's pretty likely it will be because of a misunderstanding. I spend a fair amount of time looking up extremely suspicious things on the internet. Characters in stories I've written need to convincingly shoot people, blow things up, steal valuables, conceal their identities and confound the authorities. If someone ever asked me why I was so interested in firearms or lockpicks or police procedure I hope they'd believe the answer. And I think perhaps it's affecting the way I look at goods and services.

About Microsoft's Office 2007 suite, that is. Today's focus: Word 2007.","The bad, first. That bloody Ribbon. For those who have yet to upgrade, it's an 'innovation' which nests and reveals whatever menus are considered, by Microsoft, to be relevant depending on the context. So if you are formatting some text, for instance, the format menu is displayed. 

The obvious downside to this is that a) Microsoft often get it wrong and b) the nesting is fiendishly done. I have had to use the help function almost every time I've used Word 2007, and we've had it for nearly a year now. The styles and formatting menu, for instance, used to be on Format / Styles. Now, it is a small, unlabelled curvy arrow shape at the bottom right of a box labelled (in blue, on a blue background) Styles. Change Case is a bland icon on the Font menu, under Home. I still haven't discovered where Page Setup is (I enter Preview where it is on a sub menu - but it must be somewhere else). Paste Special only exists on an unlabelled drop down arrow under Paste - on the Clipboard menu, which is in turn under Home. And much of what used to be under 'File' is now under a round, yellow, unlabelled button with the microsoft logo on it - naturally. 

However, there are some good parts to it. I am enjoying using the Document Map facility to edit a book I'm working on at the moment which contains a lot of multi-tier headings. Rather than have to hold in my head which level a heading should be at, I have a live list of all headings in the document - which are hyperlinked so I can navigate quickly and simply.  Naturally this requires the use of paragraph styles - another excellent reason to use them in your documents. Local formatting is evil, remember. 

What else is cool? Nothing really stands out, so I come back again to the Ribbon - something that features in all the Office products from Excel to Powerpoint. I get the sense that the poor developers were yelled at to innovate at all costs so felt forced to come up with something - anything - that looked new and swishy. I've yet to talk to a Word 2007 user who feels it's an improvement. (Er, that would be Rob and Anna, then.)

Oh yes, and the icing on the cake? Office 2007 is XML based, which normally I would celebrate except there's hardly anything cool (on the Developer menu) that one can use, easily, in everyday situations. I end up using Adobe products for my XML fun. But now that the code underlying Office 2007 is so fundamentally different, the files it saves are different. Result? Dreadful backwards compatibility - which means that if I save a Word 2007 document in its correct format - .docx - the recipient has to have Office 2007 to read it. It means I end up saving most docs as .doc, which tends to entirely defeat the point of upgrading. 

Have you upgraded? Any thoughts?","","","","2008-09-18","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

And if they get the big bucks for taking all the big risks, how come they can retire to a private island after a few years while their employees are queueing up at the dole office? Is it really true that you can't fill the top spots with the right people unless you pay those sorts of salaries? Or is it just a sort of Old Boys Club? And do you really want a boss who'd walk away if you paid him less than a million a week? 

When too many ordinary folk start noticing that the system awards a king's ransom to the people who lose them their jobs it's time for a few concessions. I fully expect to hear a fair bit of socialist, populist rhetoric in the coming months from our elected representatives.

"41887","","1","Star Simpson","Publish","true","","First off, I'm pleased to see that <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/09/rnc_addresses.html"">charges</a> have been dropped against the reporters at Democracy Now!. You recall they were covering a demonstration outside the Republican National Convention and were arrested for participating in it and obstructing police. Granted, I'm not psychic and I don't know what happened, but they did film their arrests and they're established and award-winning reporters, so it was always going to be a bit of a stretch to believe they put down their cameras and sneaked in a bit of rioting.

<img alt=""StarShirt.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/StarShirt.jpg"" width=""315"" height=""275"" />

But elsewhere, the story of Star Simpson suggests equal levels of official paranoia. Star was an MIT student who went to pick up a friend from the airport a year ago. It was chilly so she put on a sweatshirt. Unfortunately for her, the sweatshirt was one she'd modified for an art project. It had wires and a breadboard on the front which could light up a group of  LEDs. While asking for information at the airport, the official she was talking to noticed the electronics and concluded it was a bomb. Star tried to explain it was no such thing, but state police with machine guns arrived and arrested her. They confiscated the pink plastic flower she'd brought as a gift for her friend - it had looked to the panicked official like a detonation device. There was a massive amount of press coverage. Once it was clear there were no explosives involved, most press coverage seemed to suggest Star staged the whole thing as a hoax and to get attention. 


<img alt=""StarsFlower.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/StarsFlower.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""274"" />

Eventually the hoax charge has been dropped. She has been charged with the equivalent of disorderly conduct and required to perform fifty hours of community service and make a public apology to the city. As she points out, in her soft-spoken way, the police statement at the time of her arrest said that she did the right thing for doing exactly as she was told by the police, because otherwise they would have shot her. But doing exactly as she was told has morphed into disorderly conduct.

Star was in a section of the airport open to the public and she'd passed through no security checks. Under local firearms laws she'd be allowed to carry a gun plus up to eleven pounds of ammunition with her. Instead she had a 9v battery, some LEDs, a plastic board with wires on it and a pink, homemade flower. Her college, MIT, called her conduct 'reckless' and said that the alarm it caused was 'understandable'. That, plus people spitting on her in the street, has led her to drop out of college and relocate.

Lots of people have suggested that she was criminally stupid for wearing a shirt with electronics on it to an airport. Certainly it seems that (as I've mentioned <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/09/terrorists_can_we_trust_them.html#more"">before</a>) airports are the places where nail scissors and soft drinks morph into weapons and explosives. Star admits that she hadn't realised that green leds and wires on a sweatshirt, rather than looking pretty, were somehow bomb-like. I suppose one could criticise her judgement, but given that she turned them off and tried to explain as soon as she realised, it's not clear to me why an incident like this would ever need to get as far as armed arrests and multiple press conferences.

<img alt=""InstructablesBreadboard.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/InstructablesBreadboard.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""210"" />

The purpose of terrorism is to make us consistently over-react like this, to make us afraid of everything and everyone, and what I absolutely don't get is why we believe that following the terrorists' agenda in this way is somehow fighting back. But this level of paranoia, where a nerdy girl holding a plastic flower, came within a hair's breadth of being shot as a terrorist surely can't be the right response to those trying to disrupt our society. And any attempt to make out that she deserved what happened to her next just proves to me that we're getting more than a little confused about what 'defending our freedoms' should involve. We're supposed to be protecting people like Star, allowing them to be a little naive, not making their innocence a crime. It certainly doesn't make me feel any safer.","","","","2008-09-20","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Bah. I was so sure he was going to come this weekend. Anyway, here are some late pregnancy observations I have made.","Late pregnancy is: 

1) A bit like trying to sell a house, in as much as you try to maintain a state of household perfection at all times - because who knows when you're going to have a viewing / have a baby and so be unable to hoover for three weeks? Yesterday I did a load of laundry which contained 4 items - daft. Also we have a new hoover (one of the dyson ball ones) which I am slightly obsessed with as it looks a bit like the Starship Enterprise.

2) A great motivator to get properly caught up at work. I am completely up to date on the everyday stuff (for instance, I've done the 2008 financial year end, not usually due until next March, plus my tax return, the <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/Snowbooks%20FF08%20catalogue.pdf"">spring 09 catalogue</a>, the website refresh, all the bank recs, all the bills for the near future, all the filing and paperwork, most of the current editing and layout work, and so on). For how long can I maintain this state of Email-and-list-zero, though? 

2) A bit like being a bouncy castle, because all your edges are rounded and overinflated, and you're being kicked and punched and bounced on with abandon. And you're bright yellow. (Not that last one.)

3) Painful. Don't get me started on the horrors of heartburn, which I have never suffered before and hope never to again. But that is nothing compared to SPD. I have had it (a kind of pelvic girdle pain) for the last two and a half months. It means that I can't walk without my pelvic bones and muscles hurting, and it's only getting worse. For the last few weeks I've been enjoying very fractured sleep, as pressure on the pelvis makes it worse - and of course lying prone results in pressure, no matter how many funny shaped cushions you use. I'm told it magically disappears after birth - but not for everyone. I hope it does as I have about a tonne of excess fat to lose and need to be able to run... 

4) Illuminating, of others. I've been amazed, and sometimes quite entertained, by the shockingly personal/rude/misinformed/patronising/irritating things some people say/do. Things like 'was it planned?', 'oh, you're having a homebirth - but how will you feel if your baby dies?' and worse. Go to any pregnancy website and read what shockers pregnant women report - and rest assured, I've had them all. 

5) The most astonishing thing? I've loved it all. Despite the pain, the discomfort, the tiredness, the frightening weight gain (although I haven't weighed myself since February, for mental health preservation reasons), the daftness of others, the worry of impending parenthood, it has been the most wonderful experience, and completely at odds with whatever other people have said it would be like - just like when we started Snowbooks, in fact.

And now I'm ready to meet my baby - not least so I can stop doing bank recs every other day in case he arrives. Please send eviction vibes this way.","","","","2008-09-22","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","7"

Sometimes I'm not sure whether it was a blessing or a curse that the <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9780954575915.html"">first book we ever published </a>turned out to be a total, runaway bestseller. Ach, what am I saying. Of course it was a blessing - without it we wouldn't be here. But it did make me think 'Ha, this publishing lark is great! Hellooo easy street!' and so on. Turns out that it's a wee bit trickier than our original experiences would have had us believe. But heck - at least when we're doing well we know that we deserve it! And for the first time since Adept, I have that runaway bestseller feeling again - with The Affinity Bridge.","I can't describe the feeling of logging in to Vista (our comedically archaic sales and stock management system run by LBS) on a Monday morning and seeing that another 150-250 copies have been magically ordered, and then have that happen again on Wednesday, and Friday, too. It seems so effortless - and yet I know how many things have to be arranged and stacked up just so to make this happen. One of those things is cover design (and yes, as you know, I'm particularly proud of The Affinity Bridge's <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/bookimages/9781905005888.jpg"">cover design</a>.

Then there's the hard work of the author. George Mann is not coming to authorship from a standing start: he progressed through the ranks of bookselling and now heads up a major SF / Fantasy publishing house - and has put the hundreds of hours in in getting to know every face in his sector. Lucky for Snowbooks, it's resulted in lots of doors being opened and some amazing reviews: 

""An enormous pile of awesome"" Chris Roberson, World Fantasy Award finalist and Sidewise Award Winner.

""Mann's imagination has clearly run wild in this quirky and well realised version of the world, and this is no bad thingIt's fun, it's exciting, and Mann has a very agreeable hand that's easy to appreciateHe has a sharp talent for writing and a surplus of enthusiasm for the genre..."" SCIFI Now

""The author does a superb job of recreating nineteenth century London...a thoroughly engaging storyExcellent world building; captures the Sherlock Holmes feel; never a boring passage. Bottom line: A hugely entertaining book. 4.5 out of 5."" SF Signal. 

""I absolutely loved it"" Lou Anders

""Fans of Alan Moore's work will likely enjoy Mann's depiction of Victorian asylums, slums, aristocratic soires and things that go bump in the night."" Strange Horizons 

""Automata, clattering railway carriages, hansom cabs and 'pea soupers', gas lit streets and the doffing of caps, gruff policemen, mad scientists, arrogant industrialists, sances, pentagrams, addictions to laudanum and a few ravening zombies...Mann is at the forefront of the new generation of UK genre movers and shakers."" SFRevu.com
a science fantasy novel that should appeal to lovers of both genres... one of the biggest surprises of the year and I cant recommend the book enough. Fantasy Book Critic

F. Brett Cox, SciFi.com

Then, of course, there's the quality of the writing. We wouldn't have these reviews were it not for the fact that the books is an absolute corker. 

And finally but probably most importantly, there's the response from the retailers to our stellar sales team of<a href=""http://www.allisonandbusby.co.uk""> Susie and Lesley</a>, which has been outstanding, supportive, exciting and totally heartwarming. I heart you all (especially Michael Rowley who, you'll note, we're practically naming our first born after, since he will be named Rowan Michael Barnes).

So I read through the post below once I'd published it. A big question raised itself: what makes a bestseller?","The unavoidable conclusion, from my experience to date, is that it's actually very little to do with the publisher. Snowbooks' bestsellers have been, in volume sales order (which is certainly not the same as profit order) Adept, Boxing Fitness, Plotting for Beginners, The Other Eden and The Needle in the Blood. Snowbooks has sort of intervened with each one - but have we really been the catalyst for their success? We've done appropriate covers; given our twopenneth on not much more than spelling and grammar; gathered a handful of endorsements and reviews for each; and made sure that timely and compelling sales information has been communicated to retailers and the trade. We've stumped up the cash, up front, for printing and promotion. Is that a lot of work? Have those activities made all the difference? Only one of those titles has benefitted from significant intervention from us - intervention without which the book wouldn't exist - and that's Boxing Fitness. 

It certainly seems like each time we create a book we put a huge amount of work, time, money and effort in - particularly for four colour non fiction. But I wonder - how much value do we really add? 

I suspect that the things we do which matter most and which have the greatest effect are: 
1) Retailer and sales connections
2) Cover design
3) Stumping up the cash. 

All else being equal, I reckon Rob, Sarah, Sarah, and Sue could have self published their books to look exactly like our editions. They might well have come unstuck at the actual selling part of it, though - and, of course, getting the books into stores in sufficient quantities to be noticed has always been our main priority. The question about what happens once the book's in store is pretty much down to the cover, I think (which includes any reviews and endorsements we might have garnered). 

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts. What do you think makes a bestseller? Why do you think some books take off and others don't? What's the point in publishers? Do you think publishers add sufficient value or would the world be better off with more self-published books? All interesting questions.","","","","2008-09-22","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","9"

There's something in my chimney. 

(updated)","I have a disused fireplace in my home office room, but there's a critter who's using it. I have tried to explain that it's disused, and the meaning of that, but it just makes scrabbling sounds at me. 

I do not know what size or type of critter it is. Nor do I want to open up the little sealed hatch to find out because then I'd have a loose critter about the house to catch - and I am not at my most nimble at the mo. But I don't want it to be trapped, or hurt. 

What does one do, in these situations? If it doesn't extracate itself by tomorrow morning, perhaps I should call the RSPCA. Or get Rob to come over with a fishing net. 

//update - Oh, it's a bird. I heard it flap. What do I do, internets? //

//update  - Now the ever-astute cats have noticed that there is a bird in the chimney, about an hour after it arrived there, and are taking it in turns to bat and head butt the chimney flap. This is not going to end well. //

//final (?) update - The lovely man from the RSPCA came (he was quite skinny and had a standard issue RSPCA navy blue jumper on, and because it was too big for him it made his epaulettes look GIANT) and - of course - the bloody bird was nowhere to be seen. He heard a brief spasmic flutter and a fussy cheep, and then nothing. So the bird must have taken the man from the RSPCA seriously, but not me, and scarpered. And now my office is smothered in decades-old dust and the RSPCA man has trodden soil all up my stairs and landing carpet. Sob. Still, it was extremely nice of him to come out and I'll send them a cheque - once I've cleaned this house. //","","","","2008-09-23","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","9"

Anyone know of a good internet bookstore that ships books quickly? I mean as a matter of course and not as a premium service. I order quite a lot of weird titles, so maybe that's my problem, but by the time they arrive I'm nowhere near as fired up as when I order them. I used to love the late Nineties service where you could click on a book at lunchtime and get it in the post the next morning. It would be great if that was somehow possible in 2008 without paying extra for it. Any suggestions?","<hr/>

Today's: There are three problems with blowing up any big rocks that might be on a collision course with Earth. 1) We probably wouldn't spot them until they started to heat up in our atmosphere, which would give us less than a second to mount a space mission. 2) Blowing them up probably wouldn't work. 3) When NASA reorganised its archives a little while back it threw away the plans for the Saturn 5 rocket which is the only device humans have ever invented that could send a team even as far as the moon.","","","","","2008-09-25","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Snippets paraphrased from Bill Bryson's Short History of Everything.

Edible fish are in short supply in most parts of the globe. In the 1970s, the commercial fishermen of Australia (as well as a few New Zealanders) were pleased to discover a species of fish called an 'orange roughy' living in what they'd assumed were more or less barren waters. Roughies were delicious and the fishermen set to, hauling in 40,000 tonnes a year. Unfortunately, once marine biologists got involved, they discovered the reason roughies were able to live in such nutrient-poor seas: they mature very slowly. Many of the fish being caught in the Seventies would have hatched when Queen Victoria was still on the throne. Some might be 150 years old. And it's possible that many of them would spawn only once during that long lifetime. Each fish caught could take decades to replace.  Unfortunately by the time these details were discovered a good proportion of the roughy population had already been eaten. Oops. (That's my editorial 'oops', not BB's. He's subtler than that.)","","","","","2008-09-26","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

I find it sort of strange and sort of interesting that some events take place in stories because they took place in previous stories and have become sort of weird convention. It's even stranger when these events don't happen naturally in real life. For instance, I've lost count of the number of times someone on TV has magnified  a grainy photograph a few hundred times and then 'enhanced' it to reveal an important clue. That might have worked before most of us had either digital cameras or much experience of computers, but surely no one is fooled now. We don't really think that even the most powerful computer can take the three dots on a photo that represent a shiny brass button and reveal a reflection which shows the number plate of the killer's car, do we?","Likewise I've mentioned before my surprise at how often I see a 'binary explosive' on TV. Nothing wrong with the idea of a two-part explosive, any more than there's anything wrong with the idea of a two-part glue, but in movies it's always used as a way to evade detection because the two components are harmless before you mix them. We've all seen it half a dozen times on TV and are probably quite surprised to find it's make believe (which is a problem if you happen to be <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/sep/09/3"">locked up</a> for planning to make such a thing). 

Strangest of all is the Hollywood view that if you show people in a spacecraft floating weightlessly it won't look real, so they're shown in a sort of slow-motion instead which the audience interprets as weightlessness and supposedly finds more convincing. In case I didn't make that clear, I'm saying that real weightlessness is thought to look fake, so Hollywood has invented its own fake weightlessness which apparently looks more real. Check out video footage from shuttle missions if you want to see what I mean; it looks nothing like 2001.

I've even seen B movies with time travel devices in them which feature a little three-pronged dealie-bob like the flux capacitor out of Back to the Future. Of course that could just be an <em>homage</em>, but I doubt it. The last thing most B movies want to do is raise the suspicion that they're lifting their ideas from popular blockbusters - specifically popular blockbusters with enough money to afford scary intellectual property lawyers. No, sad to say, I think it's much more likely that whoever designed these knock-off flux capacitors thinks ""that's how time machines look"".

Of course lots of weird and unrealistic things that happen over and over in movies happen simply because they're awfully damn handy if you've got a plot to service. And there's a sort of pleasurable frisson of recognition when you have one pointed out to you. For instance, it is an inviolable law that if anyone in America is murdered, their front door unlocks itself making it easy for the next visitor to discover the body.

If you haven't already read it, Roger Ebert (who's America's Barry Norman) has compiled a highly entertaining collection of them in <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bigger-Little-Book-Hollywood-Cliches/dp/1852278315/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222418569&sr=1-5"">The Bigger Little Book of Hollywood Cliches</a> and I recommend it.","","","","2008-09-26","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

I'm not a big fan of the moronic chest-pounding and one-upmanship that goes on between nations. It's used by manipulative politicians to disguise all sorts of unpleasant activities and to wrap them in the flag. But if it results in a space race, instead of an arms race, I'm perhaps a little less disgusted. China seem to be working <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/28/china.space.shenzhou"">pretty hard</a> on their space programme. They've got a space station under construction. But if they actually do what they're claiming and put a crew of Chinese astronauts on the moon sometime in the next ten years I can't help thinking it will focus a lot of attention on space exploration once again. And unlike wars in the Middle East and bail-outs of predatory financial institutions, space exploration is a waste of money I can really approve of. Firstly, it's good old-fashioned Keynesian employment. It might be made-up work, but it's made-up work developing new technologies and pioneering new forms of engineering. Plus it doesn't (if done right) involve killing anyone. And it's an endeavour that's uniquely modern. When we're looking around for signs of human progress, coordinating missions to other celestial bodies fits nicely. So well done China; let's hope the world notices what you're up to and gets competitive. To the stars!","","","","","2008-09-28","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

The deepest hole ever dug was in Russia, on the Kola Peninsula, near the border with Finland. It was 12,262 metres deep, which is about a thousandth of the way to the centre of the Earth. At the bottom, the temperature was 180C, much hotter than expected. It was also very wet down there, another surprise. Despite its depth, it reached only a third of the way through the crust. If someone ever did manage to drill a hole to the centre of the Earth, it has been calculated that it would take about 45 minutes for anything dropped into it to reach the bottom.","","","","","2008-09-29","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

I was talking to a friend today about that increasingly infamous $700bn bail-out in the US. He couldn't see why the money would be given to the banks rather than applied directly to the problems the financial crisis was causing in the economy as a whole. It is after all public money. So if it becomes difficult for ordinary people to get a mortgage or a college loan in the US, why not use the bail-out money to make those loans. That way you're buying good debt instead of bad. Let the speculators collapse but step in when the knock-on effect spreads beyond Wall Street. Of course some would argue the problem is too serious to let that happen. But <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/29/wallstreet.useconomy"">this little article</a> in the Guardian undermines the idea of the bail-out further because it reviews forty-two other banking sector failures and shows that buying up toxic assets with public money has no track record as a solution.

Actually today's (lengthy) Info-Nugget comes not from Bill Bryson, like previous days, but from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Flannery"">Tim Flannery</a>, an Australian expert on fossils, mammals and climate. I'm just finishing off his book <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Weather-Makers-Changing-Climate-Means/dp/0141026278/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222759973&sr=8-1"">The Weather Makers</a>, having read most of it earlier in the year. The bit that caught my eye was when Flannery was telling the story of how CFCs damaged the ozone layer. Things could easily have been so much worse if the world had chosen to use something called BFCs instead.","CFCs were developed in the late Twenties to be the 'refrigerant' inside fridges: the liquid that carries the heat away from your yoghurt and milk. Only much later did researchers work out that CFCs released into the atmosphere were burning a hole in Earth's ozone layer. 

In case you don't recall, normal oxygen in the air consists of two oxygen atoms (O<span style=""font-size: 70%;"">2</span>) joined together. But it's possible to stick three oxygen atoms together to form ozone (O<span style=""font-size: 70%;"">3</span>), though it's not very stable. Ozone gets formed in our upper atmosphere as cosmic rays smash into regular O<span style=""font-size: 70%;"">2</span> and split it into individual oxygen atoms. These lone atoms are super reactive and each can attach to a normal O<span style=""font-size: 70%;"">2</span> molecule to make ozone. While ozone is toxic to breathe, it's a handy thing to have floating around in the upper atmosphere because it absorbs ultra-violet (UV) light. Even a small amount of it cuts out a lot of the really nasty UV that reaches Earth.

When CFCs reach the upper atmosphere they too can be struck by cosmic rays and split into pieces, just like oxygen. The first 'C' in CFC stands for 'chloro' and when CFCs are broken up, chlorine is released. One chlorine atom can have a big effect. It bounces around reacting with ozone, turning it back into ordinary oxygen, and then moving on. Despite the fact that escaped manmade CFCs made up a very small fraction of the atmosphere, they still did a lot of damage. First a hole in the ozone layer developed over the South Pole and then another, smaller one formed over the North Pole. The holes formed there because chlorine reacts with the most ozone when it's cold. Each year the holes got bigger.

<img alt=""OzoneHole.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/OzoneHole.jpg"" width=""150"" height=""150"" />

The effect was an increase in skin cancer rates and a gradual killing off of little organisms that couldn't stand the UV radiation. Some of those organisms formed important links in major food chains. Fortunately once researchers saw what was happening they raised the alarm. Flannery notes that no one took much notice for a while, despite the danger (and those with a vested interest in CFCs launched PR campaigns defending them) but once ordinary people started seeing satellite pictures on the news with big gaps in our UV shield shimmering in front of their eyes politicians came under pressure to do something. The Montreal Protocol was the result: an agreement to get rid of CFCs, and it looks like it will stand a very good chance of eliminating the ozone holes in another few years time.

But the detail of the story which caught my eye was very early on when Flannery talks about an alternative to CFCs called BFCs. They do roughly the same job, but use bromine instead of chlorine. They're marginally more expensive and luckily for all of us it was CFCs that caught on instead. Bromine is forty-five times more damaging to ozone than chlorine. Instead of finding a hole over the poles, in a world that used BFCs, they'd have found the ozone layer in tatters. Food chains all over the world would have collapsed, skin cancer and cataract rates would have shot up, animals would have died, crops would have failed, and it's possible that the results would have been bad enough to trigger a major collapse of the global economy. If bromine had been a whisker cheaper than chlorine instead of a whisker more expensive it could all have been very different.","","","","2008-09-30","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

On the left is the US edition and on the right the UK. I've got to say, if I'm going to read about climate change I want a book with a bit of gravitas, but one that also looks like it will have some elegance to its prose so that it won't feel like a textbook. For me, the US cover looks more impressive, though the colours seem ugly to me and the little ice cube on fire is tacky. Whereas the UK design lacks authority despite being more attractive (I only bought it because I couldn't find anything better at the time). I suppose they went for the jumbly font to give it a kind of homemade, recycling feel, but it's not really about recycling; it's about environmental catastrophe. I like the clean design (see <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/09/daily_infonugget_3.html"">post below</a>) the best - elegant <em>and</em> authoritative, though something more environmental than a glass of water might have been good.

I want to share this with you, because you might not know it but there is an enjoyable new hobby for you out there which you may never have considered, and I feel it my duty to enlighten you.","It's debugging - identifying a fault in a system, program or process; tracking down the problem; fixing it. It is about the most mesmerising thing to do that I know of, ahead of playing the piano, listening to music, even reading. Even, in fact, ahead of the self-hypnosis tapes that I've been listening to for childbirth (please, not an invite to commenters wishing to disabuse me of the efficacy of self-hypnosis. It's my due date tomorrow. Give me a break.) 

You can debug almost anything, but it tends to work best on something computer-related. You can debug your car's engine, for instance, or a blocked drain, or a metaphysical problem whilst out on a countryside walk. But the most transfixing of all is computer programs. 

For instance, we have a relatively complicated suite of Access tables and reports which pull data from all over the place (mainly our distributor systems and our financial management system), reformat them, tweak them and extract the delicious data-y insides and re-present them in a way which allows us to look at the profitability of each title. Seems like some little thing goes slightly 'wrong' with it every time I use it, though (going wrong meaning I have failed to update something, usually). Same deal with the XSL that Rob and I write when we're using our ONIX data to <a href=""http://www.onixcentral.com"">make catalogues</a> and so forth - there's often a singular bug which needs fixing to make the whole thing run like clockwork. 

The act and the art of figuring out what, precisely, the problem is, and how to remedy it can take anything from about 20 minutes to a day (and that's usually working into the night) - but I tell you, it's the best fun ever. This is because it's usually relatively simple to track problems down through using a process of elimination - you identify all the possible issues then chomp through them until you find your offender - but also because you feel mighty clever. I can't quite put my finger on what makes it so easy to focus on this sort of problem, though, to the exclusion of all else. Maybe it's the purity of the problem. Maybe it's just me. But try it sometime, if you can. You might surprise yourself.","","","","2008-10-01","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

How could giving away books for free encourage people to buy them? But then giving away songs for free has been encouraging people to buy albums for the last half century. The market for music recordings (records, tapes and so on) exploded when music radio came along. What you can sell, what you should give away and where it's all heading are tricky questions. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_doctorow"">Cory Doctorow</a>'s <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Content-Selected-Technology-Creativity-Copyright/dp/1892391813/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222851572&sr=8-2"">latest non-fiction book</a> contains a collection of articles that help you think the whole thing through. If it's your job to think about the future of a publishing venture then you should really think about buying a copy. Or you could simply download it for free from <a href=""http://craphound.com/content/download/"">here</a>. (But if you do that, consider donating a paid-for copy to a library by clicking <a href=""http://craphound.com/content/donate/"">here</a>.)","In the book, Cory makes some fabulous, fundamental points about DRM. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management"">DRM</a> is the collection of mechanisms that control when people can use the media they've bought. So DRM is the thing that tells you that you can't copy your iTunes downloads to your non-Apple music player. Or that makes your British DVD player refuse to play American DVDs despite the fact it can.)

He makes equally good points about Intellectual Property. These days movies, music and increasingly books are just ones-and-zeroes. There's no physical barrier to spreading them around - at least none that works (for reasons the book explains). The only restraints are individual psychology and the enactment of laws. And those laws are being written and revised now. They'll define the commercial landscape for future publishing, so it's not a bad idea to know the direction they're taking and to work out what that means for you.

If I had a criticism of the book it's that Cory tends not to spend much time trying to work out how we can earn a living in this new world. In his defence that's probably because nobody has those answers. What he's much stronger on is explaining exactly why an existing market might be about to close up, and why laws intended to protect doomed businesses are themselves likewise doomed. Recommended*.

And while they were once plentiful, now there are even fewer of them than you think. For instance, if you've been to the American Museum of Natural History and seen the barosaurus defending her babies from an attacking allosaurus what you've actually seen is a fake. More horrifying for me is that the giant diplodocus just inside the Natural History Museum in London is also a fake. It's made of plaster. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_carnegie"">Andrew Carnegie</a> had it made in Pittsburgh and offered it as a gift to the museum. I've sat and looked up at it while listening to the irascible Richard Dawkins lecture. I've set scenes from a book next to it (again, I'm editorialising; BB does know about my personal history).

So, it's my due date today. And my birthday tomorrow. And then the nice, convenient weekend. Care to lay bets?","My midwife tells an excellent story of a young mother who presented at the hospital maternity department. At the front desk, the staff asked why she was there - was she in labour, or there for an appointment? 'No,' she replied, 'it's my due date. So I came to the hospital. What do I do now?'

Hey, turns out I'm quite clever - not, as it would be possible to think from talking to me, paranoid, naive and pathologically unable to cope with the concept of debt.","See, Snowbooks has no external debt. No overdraft, no loans. We do have a credit card but it is paid off every month and currently the balance is zero (and how else - paypal aside - do you buy goodsandorservices from the internet?). We also have a 10k overdraft arranged with a bank which has never been used - it's there just in case. We have a load of money owed to me and Rob from our initial director's loans (around 60k) but since we're not about to freak out and cancel our lines of credit to our own company, that shouldn't be a problem. 

This means we are in rather a nice position, which is good, since <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/02/banking.creditcrunch"">the Guardian</a> reports: 

""Businesses are also being hit. The balance of lenders reporting a fall in credit availability to firms rose to 36% from 32%. And again, lenders expect to cut credit to firms further.""

See, if I was running the business according to accepted financial principles, cash should not be a factor when considering whether to undertake a project. If the NPV of a project after the cost of capital is forecast to be sufficiently positive, then cash should be sought from wherever's convenient. A minority of companies would 'save up' or wait until they had sufficient cash to do a project. 

Er, except me. Not for any clever reason; not because I have a sophisticated grasp of financial management. I just don't like the unpredictability of the publishing industry, which makes it hard to forecast sales and cash flow, and I certainly don't like the idea of having an overdraft pulled away from me at a moment's notice, or having to default on a secured loan because of a downturn in sales. 

No, my approach to financial management - summarised as 'only spend what you've got' - should stand us in good stead for a while. Phew. Thank heavens I'm silly and unsophisticated.","","","","2008-10-02","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

A slightly fringe nugget today. Here we go. Life originated underground. That's not the accepted view, but speak to anyone researching the question and there's a lot of hand-wringing about how simple organisms could get their start on the then hostile surface of our planet. There's also the problem that plants are at the base of most food-chains and yet photo-synthesising is not a beginner's trick. Gradually researchers have accepted that the earliest life used simple chemical reactions to power itself and not sunlight. And that it quite possibly lived in undersea vents where there's no sunlight, only very hot water and lots of dissolved chemicals - just like there is <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/09/daily_infonugget_2.html"">deep underground</a>. Really, it's only a hop and a skip to accepting that early life began far below the surface where it's safe and warm, and conditions are stable. It evolved for millions of years until it got the hang of proper cell walls and reliable reproduction and all those other important functions. And as it got more resilient, it began to spread towards the hostile surface. Undersea vents were the halfway house until these ancient organisms had evolved sufficiently to colonise the oceans and the land.

Many of you reading this are probably British. That might mean you don't know about the US show the Colbert Report (though it is available to us tucked away on some Sky channel somewhere). I mention this because Naomi Klein was just on that particular show saying a few words about her book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shock-Doctrine-Rise-Disaster-Capitalism/dp/0141024534/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1223103048&sr=8-1"">The Shock Doctrine</a>. As you know, I regularly plug the book because I'm a little bit desperate for everyone to read it. But rather than jump straight in with the written word, you could test the waters by watching Naomi talk about her ideas in some <a href=""http://www.naomiklein.org/video-audio"">TV interviews</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.naomiklein.org/video-audio/naomi-klein-colbert-report"">Colbert Report</a> is probably the funniest place to start. (If you've really never seen the show, you need to be aware that the host is actually only pretending to an extreme conservative. It makes for mighty fine satire.)
[And maybe it's worth reiterating that the book is about unpopular, pro-corporate legislation that can only be pushed through in times of crisis - and we're in one of those now.

Anyone who's been reading this blog for a while now might recall that the converted barn I live in was also home to some cheeky mice for a while. And a vole. And not because I invited them in. I thought you might be interested to know that I've seen no sign of them for about four months now. Did I kill them? No. Despite a prevailing view that they would return, Amazing Journey style, if I merely deported them, when I finally caught them I put them outside the front door and they never came back. That might be because Pickle, next door's ghostly white cat, patrols the area (he often leaves me murine carcasses). It might be because getting back in was not so easy, even for these tiny geniuses. Or it might simply be that they felt unwelcome and consequently threw their tiny capes over their shoulders and swept off to find alternative lodgings where they might be properly appreciated. Anyway, for the time being at least, that's the end of the mouse story. Now it's just me, a few invertebrates that I dispatch unmercilessly, and possibly a bat, which I think sleeps in my roof from time to time.","","","","","2008-10-06","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I have two observations to make about tax.","1) Why are they playing wedding music as their on-hold music? Are they planning on some sort of nuptials with another government branch? You heard it here first. 

2) Why, if I send in a tax return, way ahead of the deadline, which clearly says I don't owe tax, do I also have to write a letter to them saying I don't owe tax and therefore can they give me a sensible tax code rather than the one they've sent me which would collect tax at 50%? It's a mystery. 

And those are my tax observations. I won't do any more as it's not a nice subject.","","","","2008-10-07","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Now then, I've just talked to Em about a few things. This and that. What a nice day it is, etc; And she happened to mention that she'd had a baby. Now this was news to me, although I'm sure she'd mentioned that she was interested in the idea. Apparently details are important in these matters, so you may wish to know that Rowan Michael was born yesterday at 5pm. He weighed 8lb 8oz and had an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score"">APGAR</a> score of 10, which we both agreed reflected well upon him and upon the family. If Em is to be believed, the whole thing was a wonderful experience with no complications, disasters or sudden dashes to the hospital. From what I can gather it was a textbook non-traumatic home birth and apparently the littl'un is feeding well in between naps. Em said she was planning to take the morning off - and perhaps even longer - so please be patient if you're hoping for a response from her on anything. I will be raising a glass of ginger beer to mother, father and baby (and slightly puzzled cats) and I'm sure you'll be doing the same.

I am going to write up my birth story - if you want to read it, <a href=""mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"">email me</a> but I don't think it's necessarily right for a publishing blog! Suffice to say it was the most rewarding, astounding, painful, ecstatic day of my life. I laboured at home, in bed and in a birth pool, for just under 12 hours, with 5 hours of pushing [wince emoticon] and Rowan was born in the pool. 

Since Tuesday he has been an utter joy - figuring out exactly how to feed and sleeping like, you know, a baby, since the start. Right now he's tucked up in a sling so I have two arms free to type. His eyes are blue and capitivating; he has blond highlights; big meaty fighters' fists (like his mother, heh); utterly gorgeous toes; oh, you know, everything. He's my perfect baby. 

A public thank you to my amazing husband, whilst I'm on, who has fed me, looked after me, cleaned the house, cooked, calmed and gazed at Ro so he knows he's the most loved baby in all the world, and made everything effortless. What a wonderful man. Also to my family for being so smashing. 

For worky things, I'm planning on not doing much over the next week, but will be back in action from the 20th, working from home (well, alternate gazing at precious bundle / working / gazing). Don't hesitate to email me as normal with work things - I may take longer to get back to you than normal but I'd rather you emailed than not. 

And thanks again for the lovely comments!","","","","2008-10-11","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","11"

I feel a little bit bad writing a blog post about anything that doesn't directly relate to the new member of Em's family, but out in the big world things are happening. Economies appear to be crashing. Markets certainly are. And viewed from certain angles you could almost find it encouraging.","My teenage years coincided with a period of privatisation. 'Government' was synonymous with waste and stagnation and the private sector was all about vitality and modernisation. The need to place national infrastructure in private hands was so urgent that some of it was sold off at bargain prices. When you think what British Telecom was worth, at the dawn of the current telecommunications era, it's impossible to believe that the government got value for money. Other concerns were so unappealing that they could only be unloaded if they came with fat subsidies. The railways were a potential poisoned chalice and required so much government sugar to sweeten the deal that a privatised railway system isn't really any cheaper in terms of public investment than the old dinosaur of British Rail.

At the time, if seemed obvious to all good entrepreneurial capitalists that the market could improve the power and water and transport and phone companies beyond anything that moribund state control could ever achieve. Twenty-five years on and I'm not sure the case is quite so clear. The vigour of the marketplace comes from competition and some of the privatised industries were pretty close to being  monopolies. BT, for instance, has enjoyed monopoly-style profits while allowing levels of service to drop, especially in the last couple of years. The railways were a state monopoly and attempts to break it up and create a genuine market were artificial and unconvincing to my way of thinking. 

If you want to get from station A to station B, it's very unlikely that you've got a choice of routes, unless you detour out of your way. So there's no real competition from the customer's viewpoint. And even if somehow there were three separately-owned rail routes waiting to take you from A to B, that would be duplication not efficiency. (The only way I could conceive of real competition would be to have multiple train companies covering the exact same routes, giving you a choice of which train to hop on, but the train companies would never have agreed to that during the privatisation/handover.) The same problem applies with electricity and gas and water. If you live in London, you can't really buy your water from Scotland. The pipes don't go there and it wouldn't make any sense if they did. Attempts have been made to pretend that you can buy your power from whoever, by separating energy supply from the distribution of the power to each house, but that too strikes me as artificial and more of a pretend market than a real one.

And the problem with placing all of these utilities in private hands is that they are, and always were, vital parts of national infrastructure, so they can't be allowed to go bust, raise their prices capriciously, shut down for the holidays or become unreliable. In other words, what we have in most cases are privatised companies overseen by state regulators with no real geographical competitors.

And consider this point: a privatised firm has to do everything a nationalised firm must do, but it also has to pay a dividend to its shareholders. If two companies are equally efficient, the one that doesn't have to pay out 7% a year of profits to its shareholders will be the most successful. But of course the idea is that the private company will always be more efficient than the public one and those profit dividends will come out of the gains in efficiency which follow privatisation. How often that's been borne out by experience I think is open to debate. When privatised utilities fall on hard times, and state subsidies are required, we face the prospect that public money is going directly to pay dividends to private shareholders, which is as ridiculous a situation as I can imagine.

In the heyday of privatisation, it was felt that the entrepreneurial spirit of the marketplace could overcome most obstacles. By the turn of this century, that ethos had strengthened in many quarters to a belief that any tampering with the market risked disaster. State ownership had been eliminated, state regulation was next. Once the markets could act freely, without the 'distortions' and 'interventions' of policymakers, economies could really bloom.

But if you sit down this morning to read the papers, you'll find this orthodoxy in ruins, almost overnight. People are talking about nationalised banking. Not because they like the idea - in fact many hate the ideology of it - but because there's no other choice. We either hand subsidies to the banks for them to spend as they please (which really isn't going to work in Britain, even from a Labour government which has abandoned its Labour principles as thoroughly as this one), or we take a stake in them in return for the money we provide.

And if the banking sector, with its highly fluid, global flows of capital, needs partial nationalisation (<i>needs</i> it because it cannot survive if left to the mercy of the free-market) then what does that say about those more troublesome industries for which privatisation was never going to create a genuine market?

I imagine that free-market ideologues are far from beaten. They'll find a way to justify the biggest bail-out in history as something other than a failure of their beliefs. But I like to think this will at least make the idea of state ownership and state regulation seem more palatable, more prudent and perhaps occasionally more desirable. Why shouldn't the water companies be state-owned? And why should roads benefit from massive state infrastructure-building programs while the railways must build their own bridges and tunnels? Many countries provide public transport as a right and not a profit-making opportunity and there's plenty of evidence to suggest the countries concerned benefit from that approach.

We are entering a period where we'll need massive coordinated efforts in areas like power generation and distribution, transport and the supply of water. We'll need decisions to be taken that are right for the UK as a whole, but not necessarilty for any one particular business with entrenched interests. To me, there's little sign that turning over chunks of our national infrastructure to private hands has caused them to be modernised or updated - except where the government has insisted upon it. The water pipes leak, the power companies charge too much, the trains run late and BT can't be trusted to connect a phone line on time. 

Markets are resilient things. They work well even with state hands on the tiller. Microeconomic theory would have us believe that markets are at their most efficient when there is no unemployment benefit, national health service, state pensions, minimum wage, income tax, health and safety rules, environmental protection or sick pay. But none of us (bar a few die-hard US Republicans) want to live in that world. We want capitalist markets to pull the economy not to steer it. We risk stifling it when we regulate it, but we risk ruining our society when we don't. And this latest crash suggests that even the markets themselves don't always benefit from the free-market system. I'm sure someone will come forward and explain this latest crash as the fault of <i>too much</i> rather than too little regulation, but unless I miss my guess, no one will have very much interest in listening to them.

The goals of sustainability and CO2 reduction, not to mention social equality, fit quite nicely with a world where full-steam-ahead industrial growth and wealth production are not the primary goal. If we're ever going to have another period of benevolent state planning, perhaps modeled after the Scandinavian and low countries, now would be a good time. The bankers who wanted to be richer than Croesus, and screw everyone else, now admit they need public money to avoid losing everything. When even the staunchest free-marketeers are pleading/demanding state intervention just this once, it's a golden opportunity to make some changes and set ourselves on a slightly different track for the future - perhaps one where society and not the economy is our prime concern.","","","","2008-10-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I have my grumbles with the New York Times, but I'm constantly impressed that they continue to employ Paul Krugman. He says some terrible things that are bound to upset important people. The fact that they're all true, and need to be said, doesn't detract from the outcry, I'm sure. In fact it undoubtedly adds to it. He's one of the few economics pundits whose words I really set some store by. So it's rather gratifying to see that he's just picked up a Nobel Prize. It's not what he won the prize for, of course, but he was also one of the few explaining that a crash was coming and why - while many others called it unthinkable (and continue to claim that no one could have seen it coming). In case you're interested, you can read some of his wise words <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/?8dpc"">here</a> in blog form or his columns <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html"">here</a> (page down a bit).

Today's intermittently diurnal tidbit comes from a book I doubt any of you will want to read: <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kinesiology-Enhanced-Skeletal-System-Function/dp/0323048862/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1223926834&sr=8-4"">Kinesiology - The Skeletal System and Muscle Function</a> by the improbably named Joseph Muscolino. Nevertheless, this (somewhat paraphrased) extract might be of interest if you're either a habitual carrier of laptops or a female lady of the feminine gender.
<span style=""font-family: courier; color: #440000;"">Carrying a purse or any type of shoulder bag is an extremely common habit that can lead to postural distortion. Although the weight of the bag is important it is not the most important aspect. Even carrying an empty shoulder bag can cause the muscles that elevate the shoulder girdle to spasm and so distort the posture. The reason is that the natural slope of the shoulder is such that a bag would fall off. To prevent that from occurring, a person will isometrically contract musculature to elevate the scapula. This long-standing isometric contraction eventually leads to a chronic postural problem regardless of the weight of the bag (although greater weight means the muscles will have to contract more forcefully). Wearing a bag that has a strap that goes over the opposite shoulder and across the body is healthier...</span> Just in case there's any doubt what that said: you have to hunch your shoulder to stop a bag, even an empty one, falling off and that messes up your posture eventually. Putting the strap over your head will help a bit.","","","","","2008-10-13","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

It's sometimes tricky, when describing <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Mann.html"">George Mann</a>'s books, to convey the genre in which they sit. One word puts you on the right track, but it's not a word everyone is familiar with. Yet. But a glance at the Guardian today suggests that the ordinary man on the top deck of the Clapham omnibus might soon be tolerably well informed about the term 'steampunk' . The front page of the Guardian's website has a <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/oct/17/popandrock2"">story </a>about the Steampunk phenomenon, which I assume means it's in a position of some prominence within the paper edition. The story explores the musical side of Steampunk, which is an angle I've never really considered. I'm quite familiar with the alternative-world Victoriana that might catch a steampunk's eye in the way of gadgets or outfits, but I've never paused to consider what tunes might reside on their engraved brass iPods. The story mentions Portishead and hints at Eastern European gypsy music (I'm thinking mournful violin laments) which would have been guesses of mine too, and perhaps I'd add The Avalanches for jauntier occasions. Or might steampunks have plundered the future for their melodies using experimental wirelesses combined with circuits from a time machine? Presumably it's a question that many Guardian readers will be mulling today.

Forgive me if I'm telling you something you already know, but I've only just got round to exploring some interesting subterranean nooks of the iTunes Store. The store itself is pretty familiar. You can't use <a href=""http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/"">iTunes</a> without 'accidentally' being taken to the store from time to time as you attempt to navigate what I consider an appalling, though attractive interface. And I knew that the store would sell me over-priced music locked to Apple's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management"">DRM </a>system. And I even knew that these days you could download movies and TV shows, as well as applications for your iPhone. But what I didn't realise was quite how many free downloads there were, especially video podcasts.","Go into podcasts, then choose video podcasts and pick a subject area. I've been learning how to do so much more with video editing and compositing than I would ever have figured out by myself, even by reading paving-slab-sized books on the subject. I've also added subsciptions to my favourite finds. Despite the implication, this doesn't cost anything. It just means that every time a new edition of something I like is released it gets downloaded automatically. I have to say, that with hours of interesting (and in my case educational) videos beginning to pile up on my computer, I'm finally seeing the point of buying a video-capable iPod (or owning an iPhone). I've resisted the idea of watching ordinary movies and television on a playing-card-sized screen; that's what big TVs with surround sound are for, but video podcasts tend to be lower-resolution anyway. I could be watching gee-whiz tutorials for cool visual effects or catching up on news and documentary programs while I'm sitting on a train. And I'm reasonably sure that iTunes would make copying those files over to an iPod pretty simple. I'm not a fan of locked-in, over-priced downloads, but it seems to me that the iTunes store is providing a real community service by hosting so many free downloads. Recommended.

It looks like I can add in some links to cool iTunes stuff. Maybe. I'll post a couple and see whether they work.

<a href=""http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?i=40017867&id=160892972"">Here</a>'s another one by Steven Pinker, Great Thinker (as I like to call him).
He's talking about his opposition to the idea of the infant human brain as a blank slate. I also heartily recommend S. Pinker's book, The Blank Slate.

Hello, I'm back! 

I have to report that I have given birth to a superior child. Last night, and the preceeding three or four nights, the young master woke only twice in the night. For non-parents of newborns, that is rather super. He is also a pro at feeding. In summary, I have had what feels like a fortnight's holiday (punctuated only by some astonishing hormonal swings) and return refreshed and happy!","Andy and I have both read a lot on our leave. I've been at the five thick Jeeves and Wooster omnibi that Andy kindly bought me. Mostly the same thing happens in each story. Jeeves pales at the sight of a particularly fruity cummerbund; Bertie gets into a scrape with an aunt; all is resolved when Jeeves' superior brain comes up with a plan. But they're thoroughly enjoyable, none the less. 

Andy has also been reading long books - the <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1405088834/ref=amb_link_80159865_1?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0K5M52J8JGAEFKVFFBS5&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=221485391&pf_rd_i=56"">Paul Hamilton </a>trilogies. Good if you like Iain M Banks, he says. Which we do. 

Thanks again to everyone who's sent such kind wishes, cards and presents. It's appreciated more than I can say. And now - on with the Snowbooks show! (I'm not, of course, dumping little Ro on someone else at his tender age - he will be steering the good ship Snowbooks from the comfort of his sling. After all, in 21 years he may well want to do that full time...)","","","","2008-10-21","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand"">Price elasticity of demand </a>(PED), that is - the degree to which sales are affected by changes in price. As we go into recession, as shoppers become more and more reluctant to open their purses, I think that book pricing should be under renewed scrutiny.","A senior booktrade figure says in <a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/in-depth/feature/69193-are-the-kids-all-right.html"">The Bookseller</a> today: ""Books still represent great value for money so, in many cases, a small increase in price to cover production costs shouldn't have a negative impact on sales."" The interesting thing is that it's impossible to know whether that is the case or not unless you try it. You can model PED based on historical data of similar titles, but you can only calculate it when you have some actual sales data to go on. My view, though, is that shoppers are more sensitive to price in the book market than we might think. 

One of the reasons for this is the uniform way in which prices are set. A and B format paperbacks are, for the most part, 6.99 or 7.99. (I have a whole separate rant about hardbacks pricing.) All new titles are discounted, either in a BOGOHP or a 342. Backlist titles, most interestingly, are most often the same price as frontlist titles. Where other retail sectors make their margin on the 'backlist' non-promotional products (you don't think that a bag of screws really costs B&Q 2.25, do you? Products like these deliver a 65-80% margin), we have missed the opportunity to make high margins on titles that people are going to buy anyway regardless of price. People don't even notice if a specific book they have searched out is 8.99 rather than 7.99. Indeed, yesterday I paid 21 on Abebooks for a book I really wanted. So we have sent messages to the shopper that new titles are bargains and backlist are expensive. Thing is, when expensive means 7.99 for a 300-odd page paperback, there isn't much wriggle room downwards. 

The book industry has managed pricing so strangely in recent years that I don't think we can hoike prices up without the message to shoppers being a negative one. Like Gordon Brown, we should have got our house in order whilst the going was good. Now that purse strings are tightening, we don't have the luxury of sending out messages of price rises. And if we do, I don't think shoppers will tolerate it.","","","","2008-10-23","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

Sorry about the lack of photo thumbnails on the blog lately*. I've been on holiday for the last week, in Portugal. Very nice. But I've had almost no internet access: slow dial-up for five minutes every few days. It's completely amazing to me how many times I wanted to look something up and couldn't. Questions arose, intriguing possibilities were considered and no determination could be made. Likewise with news. We watched <a href=""http://english.aljazeera.net/"">Al Jazeera English</a>, because it covers stories in parts of the world that AP/Reuters hardly touches and tends not to suck up to the same people as News International and its cohorts, but I'd far prefer to fetch my news rather than have it served up to me. While relaxing on holiday I certainly wouldn't have spent a <em>lot </em>of time in front of an internet connection, even if it had been available, but it still would have come in mighty handy half a dozen times a day, in between walks along the beach. And while England is damp and uninspiring to return to, it's a small consolation being able to find out what my bloggy friends have been up to - and that <a href=""http://www.dailycoyote.net/"">coyote </a>I like to keep an eye on, of course.

At this morning's 3am feed, with my head lolling back on the headboard, I was suddenly struck with a clever idea to do with dual merchandising and the internet.","Dual merchandising is where the same product appears twice in a store. For instance, you might make the case for handwash to be sited in the soap section, as well as the kitchen section. Or there's that famous case of the beer and nappies which I've mentioned before (briefly, one of the grocers did an experiment, siting beer next to nappies because they reckoned men would be sent to the shop to buy nappies, and wouldn't be able to resist the lure of the sweet, sweet beer if it was right next to them. According to legend, it worked.) Space planners and commercial analysts hate dual siting because it's a waste of space and an unnecessary complication, and sets a precedent for the buyer mucking around with stuff. The problem is that once you site a product in a couple of places, a case can be made pretty easily for siting it in a third, fourth and fifith place. Before you know it, you've got a store in a right mess and plummeting margin per linear foot. 

On to my clever idea. It dawned on me at 3am that online stores don't have the problems of real world dual siting. Space is free, pretty much. You're not trying to squeeze every last drop of productivity out of your footage. So there's no reason why products can't be categorised and sited in as many ways as possible. The basic arrangement can still be in standard categories, but there's so much scope for some innovative bringing-together of some pretty crazy - but possibly quite inspirational - product combinations.  For instance, wine and chocolate next to books for a nice night in; OU courses next to serious non fiction; telescopes next to astronomy books. You get the gist. Care to name any possible innovative pairings in the comments below?  Then together we can take the idea to Amazon and sell it to them for a million pounds. Perhaps.","","","","2008-10-28","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

I've got a few thoughts of my own to add to <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/10/3am_inspiration.html"">Em's</a> on the subject of merchandising. In case you haven't come across these terms, 'ranging' is deciding which products to sell in a particular store, 'stockholding' considers the quantities of those items you might keep on hand, and 'merchandising' concerns itself with how to arrange those products on shelves. In an old-fashioned general store, there might be very little merchandising; there might be a counter and a man in a brown coat who fetched whatever you requested from the back room. Car parts were still sold that way when I was a nipper and woe betide you if you didn't sound like you knew what you were asking for (c.f. <a href=""http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz2-ukrd2VQ"">The Two Ronnies, Fork Handles</a> for an illustration of the format.) Modern shops, though, put a lot of their stock out on shelves. Stock is there both as an advert and as a product you can put in your basket. We don't really use the term, but most stores now are 'self-service'. And places like B&Q warehouses are sort of the ultimate in self-service in that they've turned the back room into the shop floor. Palettes of stock stacked to the ceiling constitute the 'display', such as it is. And the dominance of the self-service format is why we've all heard the expression ""We've only got what you see on display"".","If you want to site a product in two places in a store you need two lots of it, so dual siting increases your stockholding requirements. It also makes it much trickier to calculate the effectiveness of your merchandising because when you ring up a purchase, you don't know at first glance which location in the store it came from. A dual sited product will have the same barcode whichever shelf  it came off. 

But in an internet setting, the display item is just a picture, it's not the product itself. And you can put pictures all over the place without running out of shelf space, or stockholding budget, or getting confused over which parts of your website are generating sales and which aren't. Which is basically what Em was saying. I just wanted to point out another possibility exploited by Amazon and others: that of virtual inventory. Because the item on display is a picture, you don't need to have any stock on hand in order to offer something for sale, whereas a traditional shop with bare shelves is a bit of a turn-off. If you're something of a rotter, you could be temporarily out of stock and still accept orders over the web anyway. In fact, in the days when websites were just bolted onto the side of existing retail operations, there was no way to tell the customer what was in stock. It takes a lot of integration between warehouse and website to have live, up-to-the-minute stock information. These days it's only small operations with basic IT or those who favour sharp practices who take orders for out of stock items without warning you first.

Really slick retailers have wired things up so that their website not only has visibility of what's in their warehouse, they also know what's in the warehouses of their suppliers and how long it will take to get it sent over - which allows them to show you an estimated delivery date even for a product they've run out of. Amazon do this and it's a fabulous system that, speaking purely from personal experience, never seems to work properly.

But nevertheless, the possibility exists (assuming you had no scruples at all) to advertise for sale anything you could think of using only a picture of it on the website, and then wait for the order to come in before you tried to source some stock of it. Imagine a virtual competitor to Harrods, accepting orders for emus and vintage Steinways and truffle-flavoured dental floss, despite having no stock on hand of anything. And only once they'd got a firm order (and payment up front) would they set out in search of a supplier. With a really good sourcing operation it might even work.

To translate that into Two Ronnies terms, the man in the brown coat disappears to the back room and is gone for a suspiciously long time before reappearing, perhaps stamping snow from his boots, with the item in question. (Though sadly the Two Ronnies retail model is not sustainable because inevitably a humorous misunderstanding has resulted in the wrong product being fetched.) But in an era of print-on-demand or manufacture-to-order, virtual inventory might become an established trend. And to return to Em's original point, the merchandising display for every customer might be different, tailored to their previous purchase history and known interests. Or at least that's the sort of thing people said was going to happen back in the late Nineties when you could become a billionaire just by sounding convincing on the subject of the web. Ahhh, billionaires. Remember them?","","","","2008-10-28","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

The Bank of England are <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/28/economics-credit-crunch-bank-england"">estimating </a>the cost of this current market hiccup as being $2,800,000,000,000. That's getting on for three trillion dollars if I've hit the zero key the right number of times. I can't help wondering how that figure compares with profits from the shadow banking sector since the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass-Steagall_Act"">banking rules</a> that were introduced following the 1929 crash were eased about a decade ago. Wouldn't it be ironic/galling/coincidental if the amount of money required to bail out the financial sector was exactly the amount that the financial sector had made off with in profits by doing dodgy deals? Because that would make it clear that those yachts and Porsches and third homes were effectively paid for with public money. And people might ask for some or all of it back. Not that I can imagine that happening. But you combine that three trillion with the three trillion the Iraq War has cost and pretty soon ordinary people are going to start noticing there's a problem. In fact, in America, I think they have. But the proof will be on election day. I have my fingers crossed that the least corporate-sponsored (front-running) candidate of recent years will carry the day. I intend to let off some fireworks to celebrate.","","","","","2008-10-28","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

I imagine you've all seen it, but I rather like the idea of misleadingly populist covers for classics.

I forswore buying a Jane Austen book a while back (you may <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/04/the_art_of_persuasion.html#more"">remember</a>) because they'd made it look like a YA fantasy novel.

And speaking of YA fantasy novels (which I peripherally just was), Cory Doctorow's <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Brother-Cory-Doctorow/dp/0007288425/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225372236&sr=8-1"">Little Brother</a> is now out in the UK. I've actually read it twice. I didn't mean to, but I really enjoyed it the first time through and happened to glance at it again and an hour or so later realised I was still reading. There are a couple of times in the story where I begin to roll my eyes and wonder why I'm reading something principally aimed at teenagers, but before the thought can properly take hold I get caught up in the book again. If you want to pigeonhole the story, it's like something that might have got commissioned if the ghost of George Orwell possessed an executive at Disney.","It's set in San Francisco and follows one of a group of high-schoolers who happen to be out wandering the city, playing an elaborate game, when they should be in class. Which is bad luck for them because they get caught up in the human stampede that follows a major terrorist attack. Worse still, when they try to flag down someone official to help their injured friend, they get swept up as part of mass arrests of anyone who can't satisfactorily explain their presence at the scene. And while it's the terrorists who started it all, everything bad that happens from then on comes from the authorities' eagerness to throw away the rulebook and do whatever it takes to punish the guilty - even if that means treating its citizens like criminals. Marcus, the book's narrator, soon realises he's got just as much to fear from those in authority as he does from his country's enemies. Frightened and angry he decides to do something about it.

Unlikely to be your cup of tea if you find Woolf too cliched or Joyce too predictable, but I've always preferred rattling good yarns to literary fiction so I loved it. If you're the sort of person who doesn't turn your nose up at watching Buffy there's a pretty good chance you'll enjoy Little Brother.

There's a bit in today's Guardian about George W. Bush's <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/31/george-bush-usa-culture"">cultural legacy</a>. You can imagine what it's like. Twelve writers piling on the outraged superlatives. I got bored after reading the first few. But then I realised I had spotted a change of my own over the last eight years.","In the US, the Nixon administration and the Vietnam war marked a shift in attitude after which an appreciable number of people, for the first time, didn't trust their government. I think the recent administration has completed that. Mistrust of authority is now a default position for many. Ten years ago you could write a story about a secret under-cover government organisation doing lots of cool espionage and saving the day. These days virtually no one is prepared to believe an outfit like that could be a force for good. If you tried to make them heroes, you'd at least have to show them making mistakes or wrestling with the question of torture. 

I think nowadays the more secret something is the more suspicious we are of it (we used to just think it was cool or important). And think of all the movies from the Eighties and Nineties where the President was portrayed as noble and wise and a handy <em>deus ex machina</em> for resolving your plot. That won't really fly any more. It would seem too farfetched. There's always been subversive writing - yesterday I mentioned George Orwell, someone who set the modern standard for doubting authority - but I think over the last eight years the spirit of counter-culture has pervaded everything. It's no longer a radical position to say the government lie to us and abuse their power; it's just the way things are. Even James Bond has to live with consequences these days, he has to worry whether he's doing the right thing. And as for George Bush's legacy, whether presiding over a mass outbreak of public cynicism turns out to actually benefit the world will depend. As ordinary people soak up anti-authoritarian attitudes and themes from the stories that we read (and watch and listen to) we'll become more difficult to manipulate next time around. On the other hand, if we're about to enter an era where our instincts for trust and cooperation are no longer weaknesses, then the Bush legacy might turn out to be even more toxic than some of those Guardian commentators fear.","","","","2008-10-31","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

"41959","","1","Working with a newborn","Draft","true","I've titled this post deliberately so that people who type the phrase into google find this post - because that's what I was doing a few months back. I spoke to very few people in pregnancy who thought I could manage to work as well as look after a newborn. Well, we're nearly a month in and I'm happy to report that you can, actually.","A tiny bit of me is writing this to say yah boo sucks to those who were so convinced I wouldn't be able to cope, but there's a large part of me which wants to share this with other pregnant women concerned about juggling work and a baby. I found precious few references on the net to women who work and do full time childcare and wondered if I was being delusional. Hooray, not on this occasion. 

True, I'm blessed with a colic-free, cheerful baby who sleeps and eats well but that, I think, is largely down to his relaxed home waterbirth. He didn't have a big dose of opiates, harsh fluorescent lights or rough-handed paediatricians to greet him on his entrance into our world. Of course, I would say that. Who knows the real reason for his chilledness - let's just say I'm very lucky. 

Given that he's such a joy to be with, here's what I do: 

- Strap him to me in a sling where he sleeps most of the day. This leaves two hands free to operate a computer / do paperwork and filing / pet the cats.

- Go to bed at 7.30 / 8pm. Yes, I know that is crazy early. But it gives me an extra few hours' kip to make up for the night feeds, so in the daytime I'm not tired. 

- Work from home. This would be a lot less of a rosy story if I actually had to commute. Shudder. 

- Work for myself. I can manage my own day without anyone breathing down my neck asking what I'm doing. 

- Expect a teatime mini-meltdown, which seems to be his MO, and get everything done by then. 

Er, that's it. Not being sleep deprived and babywearing means it's business as usual, pretty much. In fact, I've probably been a little more productive as I've culled the number of hours I spend gazing at the internet, since I'm always aware that he could wake up at any time and need playing with/ his ears nibbling / gazing at.  

In mid November I have my first day where I need to be in an office, so I'll let you know how that goes. I fully expect comments gleefully saying 'ooh, it won't last'. But, for the moment, this is working out tremendously well.","","","","2008-10-31","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

As part of my plundering of the <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/10/nooks.html"">giant invisible underbelly</a> of free video podcasts in the iTunes store I was watching  something about visual effects. A famous effects guy called John Knoll was being interviewed and he was talking about some of the amazing projects he's been involved with. For instance, it was him and his brother who wrote the first version of Photoshop. But the story I was fascinated by was John's attempt to use the old telemetry data for the Apollo moon landings to create a realistic CGI version of the event.","I was surprised to learn that all the original NASA recordings of the landings were shot with a camera that took 6 pictures a second. Well, a normal movie camera takes 24 shots a second, so 6 frames-per-second is too slow to look right. So every time it's shown on TV that footage is speeded up. But they can't just speed the sound up and have astronauts sounding like chipmunks, so they chop out a lot of it, leaving the key moments in place. Plus you only see the view from the lander's cameras. If you have photos of the moon, photos of the lander and you know its movements from the telemetry data you could in theory visualise what the landing would have looked like to an imaginary outside camera following the lander down. And that's what John Knoll has been doing in his spare time: making an accurate 'fake' recording of the lander arriving on the moon complete with unabridged audio. Cool. 

He hit a snag, though, when he tried to get hold of the original magnetic tapes containing the data. They'd been reused on other projects. The raw data from the moon landings. Taped over. Amazing. So he ended up working from the paper record of the telemetry. I think the final product ended up as an IMAX movie, but I can't find any good links to it. But here are some hi-res stills.

I wonder what this election would look like if Al Gore had won in 2000. Would the mood be shifting left or right? And in 2004, I was never very excited about a John Kerry presidency except for its single magnificent selling-point of not being a continuation of the Bush administration. But think back to Bill Clinton's reign, back when America was popular(ish), solvent and at peace(ish). The Democrats didn't have the votes they needed in Congress to get a lot of their legislation passed. And then they didn't have the votes to do anything at all for the first four years of this decade. But the shift to the right back then looks to be leading to a landslide to the left in this election.","For the first time in (I'm too lazy to look up the details but let's say) 75 years, the Democrats might have the White House with a liberal president in it, both houses of Congress (possibly with an unbeatable majority in the Senate), and a pretty good selection of governorships and mayorships (? mayoralties?) into the bargain. What they'll do with this is anyone's guess. Corporate sponsorship pays the Republicans to be pro-business and the Democrats to sit on their hands, but if President Obama were minded to sort out his country and restore integrity and principle to his government's policies, it seems like he'll have everything he needs to hand. 

(Of course I just can't bring myself to <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/03/us-election-republicans-democrats-tomasky"">believe</a> the election won't all somehow go wrong at the last moment and we'll have three and a half years of President Sarah Palin pulling randomly on the levers of power.)

<hr/>

And I forgot to add one of the great side-benefits of an Obama win: with the UK leadership sucking up to a Democrat president rather than a neo-con one, the UK will suddenly be a less warlike nation.","","","","2008-11-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

A reader <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/11/backlash.html#comments"">writes</a>, ""<span style=""font-family: courier; color: #808080;"">And why no blog posts about David Tennant/Dr Who?</span>"" Ahhh, yes Naomi, a good question. That last season took a heavy toll I'm afraid. Producer R. T. Davies's relentlessly downbeat and nihilistic attitude did not combine well with the frantic flimsiness of many of his story ideas. It's one thing to be giddy while you're having fun, but giddy and depressed is a sour mix. I'd be thinking of leaving too.","As I mentioned at the time, RTD had clearly had enough before he started work on the 2008 season. Whereas he used to put words into the Doctor's mouth about humanity being super, in a low key way, and indomitable, this time around it was all about our capacity to turn on each other. In fact a whole episode was devoted to how ordinary people were so vile they could really rattle the Doctor in a way that no alien menace could hope to achieve. R.T.D. clearly hated people and had had his fill of the Doctor when he sat down to plan the 2008 season and it hasn't done the show any favours in my eyes. With the exception of Steven Moffat's fabulous two-parter (in which he clearly operated <em>without </em>RTD's deadening hand on his shoulder) I cringed at every episode of last season. So puerile, so flimsy, so dour. 

If David Tennant had called me up for advice before he made his decision to leave I would have said to him, ""Davey Boy, wait until Steven Moffat's in the driving seat before you do anything final. If I'm right, he'll put the show back on course. Eloquent exuberance in abundance is in the offing. You wouldn't want to miss that."" But Steven Moffat's debut won't hit our screens until 2010. And that's a long time to ask D.T. to wait. And what if I'm wrong and Steven Moffat's influence isn't all The Doctor Dances/Girl in the Fireplace/Blink/The Library? What if it's more like Jekyll? Well, then I'd have been wrong to keep DT from other things for two more years. So as you can see, Naomi, I've kept quiet because I haven't known my own mind. And I'm looking forward to RTD's final mini-season at the helm with rather more trepidation than enthusiasm. And I certainly can't get into the spirit of speculating about replacements until I know whether I'm going to actually enjoy watching the show again. In many ways, I think the best thing to do is think of other things until Spring 2010. Hence my silence. (Em, I imagine, is just far more interested in bringing new life into the world than talking about dodgy telly.)","","","","2008-11-04","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Oh thank goodness. This wasn't a close election and it won't be easy to spin it that way. I've already mentioned one thing I liked about Obama: that he raised vast sums from small donations. That means he's representing ordinary people in large numbers. The other thing I like is that he wasn't supposed to get the nomination. The party leaders wanted Hillary Clinton and they didn't get their way. That's good because the Democratic leadership are a disaster.","They act as though not upsetting the Republicans is their main role in life. But despite their efforts,  America has ended up with someone who has hardly had to 'play the game'. He's hardly had to make strategic alliances with big industry. He's hardly ever voted with the caucus and against his conscience. And what's more, when the Republicans called him a socialist (not to mention a terrorist sympathiser and a muslim) he won anyway. So either voters on balance don't believe the Republicans or they're fine with electing a socialist muslim with radical associates if they think he's a good guy. Either of those interpretations is good news in terms of his perceived mandate.

What I'm now hoping is that some of the skeletons of the last eight years will begin tumbling out of the closet. The Cheney/Bush administration have been getting away with murder and a landslide victory for their opponents might just make the news organisations brave enough to investigate some of it.

With the election result, it's my belief that all of our chances for a happy life have just improved. 

And America will now have a president who actually reads books.","","","","2008-11-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","7"

"41968","","1","The real cost of returns","Publish","true","<div class=""pic""><img alt=""ReturnToSender.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/ReturnToSender.jpg"" width=""150"" height=""96"" /></div>

Returns are bad and stupid and pointless: yes, we all understand that. But I got to wondering what the real cost of returns is, when Rob posed the question to me: are returns Snowbooks' main problem?","See, returns cost more than just the reversal of the sales value. There are costs associated with processing them. I have calculated that the three main groups of cost (cost of pulping - 6%; cost of some arbitrary charge from our distributor for all returns over 10% - 1.5%; cost of realising the value of the stock once the book is pulped) comes to 1 per book returned. That is a lot of money: more than the cost of printing the thing. Here are some quick Snowbooks' numbers (MAT last 12 months) to put the thing into perspective*: 

Average unit cost (how much a book costs to print): 0.83 (this includes 4 colour books)
Average unit sales value 2.55
Average unit gross contribution (sales less cost of print, other title costs and royalties): 0.85

So the cost of 1.00 of a returned book is massive. Last year (our annus horribilis when lots of Xmas 2006 stock came back) the total bill was 42k. 

This doesn't include some other, more subtle costs, either. There's the cost of paying royalties on stock you think you've sold, only for it to be returned (and yes, we do include a quite hefty reserve against returns which still isn't sufficient to protect us, oftentimes). There's the distribution cost of shipping the stock for sale in the first place. There are the marketing charges for promotions which are one off charges, not dependent on whether books sell or not. There's the externalities: the cost to the environment of carting books around, of producing them and destroying them a matter of months later. There's the cost to my mental health of trying not to let my brain explode in fury every time I get a returns request. 

In summary: our industry is astonishingly backward for being the last bastion of sale or return. And returns are Very Bad. And yes, returns are Snowbooks' main problem (as opposed to low sales, for instance) - sure, we could do with selling more books, as every publisher would believe, but returns have a spectacularly high cost that is much greater than a simple reversal of the original sales value.  Thankfully for us our returns rate is much lower than it has been in the past, but that's not the point. Any money spent on returns is money down the drain, and that is unacceptable.

There's a very measured obituary for Michael Crichton, who I'm sure you know has just passed away, in the New York Times. It hits all the points I would have made, about how he couldn't write relationships but he <em>could </em>sneak in lots of little lectures so that you came away a little brainier (except when his wild speculations got the better of him).

As a writer he was a kind of cyborg, tirelessly turning out novels that were intricately engineered entertainment systems. No one - except possibly Mr. Crichton himself - ever confused them with great literature, but very few readers who started a Crichton novel ever put it down.</span>","","","","2008-11-06","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

A nice lady writes in to say ""I love what you're doing with Snowbooks - they all look great, especially George Mann's new one. What's your background, have you got loads of design and editorial qualifications and stuff cos you're doing what I'd like to be doing but I can't afford to retrain! Can you offer me any advice?""

I get asked this sort of thing relatively often so thought I'd blog my response, so I can lazily point people towards it. The secret of my success, that is: great laziness.","The poor lady asking her question probably only wondered how to get a job in design, so this reply is likely not to be very useful, as I don't know the answer to that. Here's an answer to a slightly different question, then: how to start one's own business. 

First up - I have no training in anything, unless you count an archaeology degree and a large bunch of perfectly ghastly management training courses. I have, however, read many books, especially big thick ones on IT, and have worked in retail for the first ten years of my career, which learned me a thing or two. If you're striking out on your own, that's fine - you're not going to interrogate your own CV for qualifications. If you know you can do the job, that's all that matters. If, however, you're hoping to be employed by someone, I'd have thought a portfolio would speak louder than a training certificate. My approach to design has always been to fuse commercial realities with the knowledge of how to create artwork on a computer. It's less about artistic flair; more about hours spent reading the big thick IT books, practising for endless hours and having a clear idea about the role of cover design. That role, of course, is to sell books - not to indulge the designer's ego. 

It's interesting with queries like this that people assume they want to be doing what I do. Erm, do you really? Personally, I love it, but then I am motivated as much by running a good company as by being a good publisher. What I mean is that I enjoy keeping the bookkeeping up to date, keeping the administrative side of things in order, working with good suppliers and customers and generally running a business. Sure, I spend a lot of time on cover design, layour, typesetting, editing and what not, but the majority of my day is spent making sure the business stays in one piece.  

But if you are intent on setting up on your own, and starting your own company, here are my top five tips: 

1) Be adequately capitalised for the scale of the venture you have in mind. If you have no money, then don't give up the day job and consider creating a POD company to minimise stock costs. Snowbooks cost nearly 100k to get started, and that was just about right. (As an aside, Rob sometimes asks me what I'd spend the money on if we suddenly got 1m to invest in Snowbooks. I have no idea. Probably put it in the bank. Or buy an old cinema.)

2) Do everything yourself. Even if you end up hiring skilled workers in over time, you should know how to do everything, from bookkeeping and accounting to cover design in Photoshop, from doing sales calls to forecasting cash flow. Plus every small venture should be obsessed with keeping costs low, and doing everything yourself is the best way to achieve this. 

3) Remember that the most important goal you should have is to stay in business. That means turning down a book you might love if it has no commercial prospects. Can you bear to do that? 

4) Ignore all advice. As long as you've thought through your business plan to your own satisfaction, and run some plausible forecasts of cash and sales, then I would advise you (heh) to ignore all the gems of advice that people will want to give you. They're never going to be in context; they're going to be people's opinions based on their own experiences and that's not necessarily relevant to you. If your venture is successful, it'll be because of how you run the business, how you behave, how you choose to act - it'll be down to your personality. No amount of advice is going to change your personality, so you may as well ignore it. 

5) Remember that the customer is always, always right. Give the customer what they want.","","","","2008-11-07","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

I heard it a lot when we were starting up Snowbooks, and I was surprised to frequently hear it again when I was planning a homebirth. Turns out both of those things gave me the best days of my life. I imagine I'll hear it when I start talking in earnest about homeschooling in a few years time. 

Have people ever used that phrase on you? I would be fascinated to hear the circumstances.","","","","","2008-11-10","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","5"

Hey hey, it's prize entry season again. I've spent rather an enjoyable morning going through the last 12 months of the SnowBlog to remember what it is we've been up to. My main conclusions: 1) Rob is very funny, and 2) we relatively rarely blog about Snowbooks news. I am quite pleased with the second of those conclusions, because if every post was directing you to a review or a bit of coverage, or going on about how great we are, I imagine you'd stop reading pretty soon. 

So, a question: which sorts of snowblog posts do you like the best? The politics? The occasional links to Cute Overload? The publishing stuff? The business stuff? The (gulp) XSL stuff? I would be fascinated to know.","","","","","2008-11-11","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","18"

I mentioned a while back that Andy bought all the <a href=""http://www.peterfhamilton.co.uk/"">Peter F Hamilton</a> books, and after casually glancing at the first paragraph of the first book in the Night's Dawn trilogy, I ended up hooked. Thing is, the first book of the trilogy has over 1200 pages. Fine for me as a reader - it didn't feel over-long and there was little redundancy - but as a publisher I would certainly have got out my 'reject' stamp. (I don't really have a reject stamp.) 

I wonder what gems we've turned down over the years because they break the rules? One of my rules is 'if it mentioned orcs *and* elves in the first page, it's a no'. (I still think that's a good rule.) But we'll almost dismiss out of hand short story collections, anything under 70,000 words and anything over 130,000. Maybe we shouldn't. But as we say in our <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/rejection.html"">open rejection letter</a>, publishers are like shoppers at a January sale - looking out for bargains, and quickly skimming over everything else. What's certain is that our opinion is formed as much by industry norms and conventions as anything - so a publisher's opinion of your book is only interesting if they decide to publish you. It's certainly no measure of the quality of your work. 

By the way, Peter F himself writes about the writing of his trilogy <a href=""http://www.peterfhamilton.co.uk/index.php?page=Summary"">here,</a> which is interesting.","","","","","2008-11-17","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Hey, why did no one email me and Rob about this? It was just jolly lucky that Rob tuned in to Radio 4 the other day to catch a bit of pre-You & Yours listening*, and there it was!

Perhaps you don't read PCPro magazine. It is, after all, full of articles about computers, rather than books - and as the name suggests, it's aimed more towards the IT professional than the home user. The latest edition (which, because of the strange way magazines work, is labelled January 2009) has seven pages on the subject of electronic books and book readers (which I tend to call e-readers, though that's probably very last century of me). They test the current crop of readers and look at the extraordinary new models in the pipeline. They discuss the different e-book formats and also look at the geography of the e-books market. 

One particularly interesting section is their look at how <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management"">DRM</a> policy evolved in the music download market compared with how the e-book market is shaping up. In short, music downloads used to have tons of restrictions on them - you couldn't copy them or play them on too many computers or certain types of portable players. And gradually, with every major music company (except Apple's iTunes Store) the restrictions have been removed. Why? Because the restrictions gave the music companies more control but at the expense of frustrating, disappointing and frequently infuriating the customer. For instance, if your MP3 player or your computer broke and you got a replacement, you might find you no longer had access to the hundreds or even thousands of pounds worth of music you'd downloaded; your right to play those tracks was tied to the gadget and not its owner. The industry realised that whoever ditched the DRM first would have an advantage over competitors, so they all did it. And the PCPro article points out that while virtually the whole music industry has abandoned their attempts to sell music with built-in restrictions over when and how you can play it, the book industry seems to have ignored that painful, decade-long lesson and is all set to repeat the mistakes of the music market. 

Then again, perhaps the book market is sufficiently different that customers will tolerate restrictions more readily. Or, on the third hand, perhaps it's a form of unintentional sabotage: perhaps publishers don't really want e-books to happen so they're half-hearted in making them appealing.

Anyway, if you want to get up to speed with the vagaries of the e-book market, the current PCPro is a handy way to start (look for the picture of the Sony e-reader on the cover).","","","","","2008-11-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Now that Rowan's grown out of his newborn clothes, I can safely say that it is perfectly possible to run a business *and* look after a newborn - I have done it and it was quite straightforward. Sure, I have a superior child (heh), but nevertheless it's possible. 

The only thing is that if anything else happens, other than running the business and looking after the newborn, it all goes to pot. Last week we had visitors, which was lovely but completely threw my routine, plans and task list out. Still, all is back to normal now - emails under control, accounts done, cover designs underway and plans afoot for the next week. But sorry about the blog silence this week.

I have received a number of emails of late from fellow small publishers asking for advice on how to sell books. Here are my thoughts.","The first thing is that sales aren't the responsibility of the sales team: a successful book starts at the editorial stage. I know it sounds totally obvious but it's true to say that if you publish what people want, they will be more likely to buy it. Conversely, if you publish books that people don't want, you are going to have to persuade them that they want it. And with the recession closing in, even if  a person wants an item more than anything, it's no guarantee that they'll buy it as they have to also buy the week's food shop and new shoes for the nipper. So if you want to sell lots of books, don't publish edgy contemporary novellas, slim volumes of poetry or 600 page biographies of unknown people. Publish those things by all means if you want to: but we're talking about selling books, here, not publishing them. Persuading people that they want something is costly and, as an independent publisher, an additional cost that you can do without. And before you start commenting that you live for slim volumes of poetry and I'm talking rot, consider the fact that you're reading a publisher's blog. This means you are more likely to be in the small minority who regularly buys poetry - and indeed books. We are talking sales sufficient to pay the bills here - at least 3000 copies. 

So say you have a book which is entirely needful and at least 20,000 people in the UK would love nothing more than to buy it. The next stage is to make them aware of it - if they don't know it exists, they can't know that they want it. Snowbooks do this in a very targetted, focused way: we aim to have our books on display in shops. Sounds facile again but there are plenty of other perfectly valid ways: catalogues, online only, through trade shows and so on. However, we know about shops having been retailers before starting Snowbooks, and so shops it is. And now the big question that everyone asks: how do you get Waterstone's to stock your book? 

OK, take a deep breath and step back. Imagine you are a buyer at Waterstone's. You have responsibility to produce, say, 800,000 worth of sales in a year. You also have to manage all the admin of your category, which involves line-by-line analysis of stock, sales and margin every week. You have to manage all the promotions, which means lots of forms to complete, send to publishers for agreement, chase, action and file. You have to respond to the 30 or more calls a day from stores asking when such and such a book will be in, and why their allocation hasn't turned up. You have to deal with all the other departments in the business, from space planning to store ops. You have to manage all this admin at the detailed level and still make sure that your category sales are at least 40,000 a week - that's a lot of books. Put simply, you are a very busy, pressurised person. 

Now imagine that you get a phone call from a new publisher. 'Hi,' says the new publisher, 'we're a new publisher and have just published our first three books.' Does your heart soar with excitement? Do you relish the possibilities from these new three books? Probably not - you think 'great, three more new line forms to fill in, plus a new supplier form, plus I'm going to have to explain every last obvious thing to this newbie.' So you say, politely 'Great - 
what are they?' The publisher then launches into a 20 minute (unless stopped) ramble on how great these three books are. Tip: we all think our books are great. It is not a unique selling point. Another tip: when is the shopper, in store, ever going to hear your 20 minute pitch? The book should do the talking, not you. If you also go on to ask 'how can I get my book in your stores', then you need to educate yourself first. You do NOT ask the busy buyer, the key to your success, to hold your hand. You want to do all your research first, then present them with the finished pitch - which should be: 
- an AI. See our AIs on this website, and many other publishers', for ideas. 
- a finished copy of the book. The book should be of a standard size (A format - 178 x 111mm for mass market, B format - 129 x 198mm for literary), on standard paper (ensobelle 70gsm, or bulky news 55gsm), with standard finishes (spot UV, matt lam, perhaps embossing and foiling) and with a standard cover design (find a similar book in store and copy all the main elements, including barcode box layout, font size of the blurb, types of font and graphic used for different genres) and standard layout (open a book and copy the layout. No 10mm first line indents, no oversize/ undersize font.) You want the book to look like the sort of books the buyer buys all the time. Now is not the time to be changing the world - you don't have the money. Make your book the best example of its type of book on the market, whilst sticking to the basic rules as above, and you're onto a winner. 
- a catalogue, if you like, which gives the buyer a sense of your new company. Even if you have only one book, a four page catalogue can send the right message. It should contain the details of your distributor and your own contact details. You must have a distributor if you want to sell direct to the chains: you have to be able to accept EDI, and retailers don't want the hassle of setting up a new EDI link. They want to use an existing one from one of the existing distributors. Making your pitch to a distributor is as important as making it to the retailer - you want a good, big one and you have to persuade them that they will make money out of you. In other words, that your books will sell. 

So although this is shaping up to be a long post, I hope the message is simple. You do not 'get Waterstone's to stock your book'; you publish books that Waterstone's wants to stock, and you make it as easy as possible for them to do so. You do not phone important buyers asking for basic advice: you read blogs like this one, the Bookseller, you join the<a href=""http://ipg.uk.com/""> IPG</a> and ask all your questions of people who can help you. You get your supply chain sorted out; you agree without hesitation to any and all terms (60 days, sale or return, 55% discount)  - you are a delight to deal with. You don't phone them - they're busy. You don't bribe them - they're professionals. You don't publish low quality books, but nor do you use very expensive paper or avant-garde designs. You don't go in with an attitude, thinking that your books deserve to be bought and that the buyer doesn't know what she's doing. Make yourself look as much like Harper Collins, be a considerate, well-informed person, and put yourself in the buyers' shoes, and chances are both you and Waterstone's can make some money.  

------------------

Some details to add to the above. 

Waterstone's have a team of central buyers, but prefer to buy from smaller publishers via the wholesalers, Gardners and Bertrams. You can sell just as many books through this route, so treat the buyers at Gardners and Bertrams as well as you'd treat the chains. Post your AIs and an introductory letter to the New Publisher buyer at each company and it'll go to the right person, or join the IPG and find out the name of the present job holder. 

Some good distributors are Littlehampton Book Services, TBS, Macmillan and Turnaround. You have to promise them you'll sell a lot of books, and so you need to demonstrate your ambition and professionalism to them. Do your research at the IPG before phoning up. 

Use a proper book printer, not a local copy shop who rarely do books - it's less expensive and results in an authentic book. We use Haynes in Sparkford (<a href=""mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"">email me </a>for contact details); there's also the CPI group including Cox and Wyman, Mackays and Bookmarque - all great. The smaller run printers - Biddles, Anthony Rowe etc - are ok but remember not to overspec your book. Ideally, buy a book in store, send it to your prospective printer and ask them to use the same paper stock and printing process. You should be quoted less than 1 a copy for a print run of 2000 books with 4 colour covers and all the finishes (spot UV, embossing and foiling) - considerably less if you omit the finishes, but take a look in store - very few books omit all finishes. 

I hope this post doesn't sound too stroppy - I hope it helps someone. I owe everything to Scott Pack and Susie Doore, the then buyers at Waterstone's when we were starting out, and know that if you can impress people from the start you've got a good chance of getting to year 5 of your business. I hope by sharing our approach someone else can get the chances we've had.","","","","2008-11-25","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","7"

Long-time readers will know that I live in an old converted barn and some of the former residents, to wit mouses, still imagine that they are welcome to drop by. I've successfully deported three of them and instituted a crumb-less policy whereby nothing is left out for them to snack on, but the trouble is I get complacent. When there have been no mice around for a few months I might think nothing of leaving a plate on the counter to wash later or wipe down the surfaces in the morning rather than before going to bed. And somehow the mouses sense that and return.","I had a really good chase of this current one the other night. It was very invigorating and I think we both enjoyed it, but I didn't catch him. Since then I've been extra careful to make sure that there's no sustenance available to him. Coming back from a few days in London, I see that he got desperate and tried to open a sealed container (click the picture for a larger version). Had he been able to chomp it open, he'd have had access to thirty times his own body weight in quinoa (whatever that is), but he had to make do with a few mouthfuls of rubber instead.

My dad passed away a couple of weeks ago. He worked for Woolworths for 45 years. He even ran the UK company twice, doubling its profits and giving it the most successful year it ever had. It seems very strange that the firm would <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/3530113/Woolworths-staff-will-be-paid-and-stores-kept-open-until-after-Christmas.html"">fall apart</a> so soon after he died.

I hope for those still at the company there is some sort of future and that it's not all about cuts and redundancies and selling things off.","<hr/>

Sometimes they get a message that starts: <span style=""font-family: courier;"">""In an effort to curb malicious comment posting by abusive users, I've enabled a feature that requires a weblog commenter to wait a short amount of time before being able to post again...""</span> I'm going to track that message down and change it because it's not really telling the truth. Really it means you slipped up filling in your details and answering the super-secret anti-spam question. If you double-check that you've filled in all the things you're supposed to and still can't post a comment, could you let me know?

So, can anyone tell me why copyright on a book lasts for 70 years after an author's death? I don't mean 'why' in the sense of 'because that's the law'; I mean 'why' in the sense of 'what useful purpose does that serve?'. I thought copyright allowed creators to profit from their works, which was nice for them. And by doing so it provided an incentive to other creators to get stuck in, which is nice for all of us. And balanced against that is the problem that, thanks to copyright, the creator of an idea has a monopoly on it and can either gouge us for the use of it or keep it from us. Society benefits when creators are incentivised AND their creations get out into the world and are allowed to circulate. So why do an author's great-grand-children need to profit? Isn't that bad for society without doing anything very useful for authors?","I grant you that if copyright expired at the moment of an author's death, it would give publishers like Penguin, say, an incentive to assassinate J.K.Rowling. Which is not a good thing. I'm not saying Penguin would give in to that temptation, but why take the chance? So from that point of view, copyright would need to last beyond the planning horizon of most potentially-homicidal businesses - say, 15 years. No one would assassinate J.K.Rowling so that they could put out their own boxed set of Harry Potter for Christmas 2023, would they? Hopefully not. And the author's family still get a decade and a half of income to tide them over. What's wrong with that?

Is the answer purely that what you might call 'professional copyright owners' like music and media companies don't see why they shouldn't enjoy monopoly profits forever more and vigourously lobby government to that effect? Or am I missing something?","","","","2008-12-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","8"

I was pondering this morning whether there's been anything at Snowbooks that I regret. I can think of two things - a time when I paid 650 for a three week promotion but the printer delivered the title a week late, which meant we only got half the exposure we should have done (as it happens it did really well and rolled over into the next month, but I was so annoyed) and also a time when I was conned into buying Sage Intelligent Reporting for 600 which has been of precisely zero use, because it doesn't work and their helpdesk is too useless to fix it. But those are the only two instances I can think of. That's rather good. I like living a life free of regret. 

Of course, I regret plenty from previous jobs. But that's why I don't do them any more.","","","","","2008-12-03","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

You spend your days with books. Books are static, visually uniform and very few people have phobias about them. Maybe that means you're mentally well-balanced, and it will take more than a mere image to ruffle your feathers. Or maybe being around books has failed to prepare you for the 'real' world. It's made you bookish: delicate, sensitive, easily alarmed. Whichever it is, consider whether or not you have any crab-related hangups before clicking on the picture that accompanies this post.

Blogs and podcasts. It's semi-familiar content but it arrives in new ways. For instance, I've mentioned Radio Lab before. It's a sciencey radio show, only a lot cooler than that sounds, and it's on National Public Radio (which is like America's Radio 4) from WNYC in New York. But of course I don't listen to it on the radio; I download it. The website is <a href=""http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/"">here</a>. Or you could just click on the subscribe button for Radio Lab in the iTunes store and it would turn up on your computer thereafter. It would probably automagically ooze its way onto your iPod or iPhone too, but I wouldn't know as I don't have those gizmos. (The iTunes subscribe link is <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=152249110"">here</a>.)

So I was listening to one of Radio Lab's podcasts and I heard some very cool spacey cello music by someone called Zoe Keating.  Her website is <a href=""http://www.zoekeating.com/"">here</a>. The full podcast is available from WNYC <a href=""http://blogs.wnyc.org/radiolab/2008/08/25/quantum-cello/"">here</a>. It's quite clear to me that the presenter, Jad, totally fancies her. Then I did something I probably shouldn't and snipped out one whole track from the podcast and put it here (<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/ZoeKeating.mp3"">link</a>) for you to listen to. If you click on that, what you're listening to is one woman playing one cello, but recording loops as she goes and setting them to repeat so that she can play over them. It sounds good.

So I'm hoping that the copyright police will let me off for putting that file up as I'm only passing on the music as a way to entice you to either buy Zoe Keating's albums (which you can download from <a href=""https://cdbaby.com/found?allsearch=zoe+keating&submit="">here</a>) or to listen to Radio Lab. Plus even without my help you're free to download the podcast that track came from (<a href=""http://blogs.wnyc.org/radiolab/2008/08/25/quantum-cello/"">link</a>).

I like the music anyway, but I particularly like the fact that I can listen to it while writing. I'm always looking for music like that. Maybe you are too.","","","","","2008-12-04","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I wonder if someone launched a piece of confectionary called Credit Crunch whether it would be successful? Delicious golden honeycomb representing the gold that you no longer have, wrapped in a silky jacket of dark chocolate to reflect your mood? No, maybe not. Perhaps I shouldn't be thinking of new products to see us through the recession. Actually, the point of this post is to let you know how Snowbooks has been affected so far.","The answer is, not at all. Now that's not fancy bravado or immodest boasting - that's because of the nature of independent publishing - at least, our version of it. We operate on a different scale to the large houses. It means that if we have one book that does modestly well in the scheme of things, that's actually brilliant. We don't need a few-hundred-thousand-unit breakaway seller because our overheads are so low. Here are our monthly overheads, as averaged over the last 12 months: 

Payroll and drawings: 3050 a month (we're very cheap)
General expenses, including commissions, overseas shipping, post, phones, professional services, PR and so forth: 2030 a month
Print bills: 4500 a month
Marketing (promotional bungs): 750 a month

So we 'only' need just over 10k a month coming in to tick over. It's enough to keep us rather busy, but it's not an impossible amount to magic up every month. It doesn't require a flukey bestseller, is my point -  a mix of solid backlist, a couple of promotions and the onix and cover design work that I do keep us ticking over nicely. (Plus I do like to have twenty grand or so in the bank at any one time in case of emergencies.)

And given that the worries in the industry are about overall volumes crashing down, you can see how we would slip under the radar there. We don't really care about the top 100 or even 1000 books (except for our books in it - hello The Affinity Bridge!) - we care about the handful we have which perform rather nicely, thank you, without the boom and bust of mega-bestsellers. 

We have had far tougher times when the overall industry was doing just fine. Xmas 06 was our disaster, when post-Xmas returns nearly brought us down. Thankfully we emerged from that wiser and stronger. 

So my point is that smaller companies can innoculate themselves from the peaks and troughs of the market by publishing good, solid books that do just nicely. And hopefully that's what we'll continue to do for the next few years whilst the world melts down. Who knows, though...","","","","2008-12-08","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","6"

So, <a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/news/72659-deloitte-confirms-euk-scale-down.html"">EUK has gone out of business</a>. 700 people made redundant today. My heart goes out to everyone there especially at this time of year. It's heartbreaking. I used to work for Kingfisher, the company that owned Woolies and EUK amongst others, so it's been especially astonishing and upsetting to see these businesses crumble - businesses, as Rob said a number of posts back, that many people close to us have worked tirelessly for many years to make successful. 

As far as the impact on Snowbooks goes, as luck would have it we have no payments outstanding from EUK at the moment. They hold about 4000 of our stock which I don't expect to see again (which is fine - just so long as the adminstrators Deloitte - who I also used to work for, small world, eh - don't try to return it for credit, which I would refuse. I hope I'm not forced into accepting.) So we're getting off lightly. Since EUK is said to hold 15m of publishers' stocks, I think we will be in the minority. 

Crazy, upsetting times. As I say, my thoughts are with the 700 whose Christmas is well and truly ruined.","","","","","2008-12-12","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

(There are sort-of-spoilers about Peter F Hamilton's book The Neutronium Alchemist below the cut.)","When I finally stopped tinkering, though, I settled down to finish my latest book. The end angered me. It's another one of the Peter F Hamiltons I've been enjoying - this one's the second in a trilogy called The Neutronium Alchemist. 1200 pages plus, and what happens at the end? A bloooming great cliffhanger, and precious little resolution on any of the many plotlines. I have to read another 1200 pages to see what's happened. That's fine, I suppose, as I already have the final book in the trilogy and could start it as soon as I'd turned the last page of the second. But a glance at the copyright pages shows that there was two years between publication. If I'd have had to have waited* two years, I think I would have blown a gasket. I think I might vow never to publish books with massive cliffhangers at the end from now on as it's just not cricket. Also, Peter F Hamilton has a bad habit of using commas where he needs a semi colon or a new sentence. I can imagine the editor thinking that, and then thinking about the 3800 pages he'd have to edit, and thinking 'sod it'. The number of typos increases dramatically as each book goes on. I  do have some degree of sympathy with the poor proofreader.

But its not so far away, you know. In the dynamic world of Snowbooks (where we plan more than a year ahead. Hmm. A brand new definition of dynamic), 2010 is really quite close, and we are starting to think about our list. 

So this is a call out to writers to submit your work for our 2010 slate  one which we hope will be better than ever. 

<strong>Here is what were interested in: </strong>

	Were also looking to scale up our non-fiction publishing programme. We are interested in all topics  even quite specialist or technical subjects if they are interesting enough and written well - wed like to publish books that are the best in their field, from super-clear introductory texts to, for example, popular science, current affairs, technology, cookery or gardening. Or, I dont know, bee-keeping. The important thing is the quality of the writing, not the subject. All our non-fiction will be published in full colour with lots of illustrations and photos. 
(I wish non-fiction had a less negative name. Informative books, lets call them. Oh, no, thats no good either.) 

<strong>What were <em>not</em> interested in:</strong> Childrens, poetry, biography, experimental, edgy literary fiction, derivative fantasy featuring lots of orcs and elves.  
<strong>What we might also be interested in: </strong>Other genre writing including chick lit & crime. 

Please follow the instructions at <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/submissions.html"">www.snowbooks.com/submissions.html.</a> You'll need to send full, not partial or proposed, fiction manuscripts. (Non-fiction proposals are OK, but a full non-fiction manuscript is ideal.) Remember to follow the file naming conventions and the guidelines for the email subject line, otherwise it'll be deleted. And please do consider getting in touch, even if youre not sure your work is right for Snowbooks. We are actively and keenly looking for books to publish so you have nothing to lose and a lovely shiny Snowbooks contract to gain.","","","","","2008-12-15","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","16"

Just finished doing the year end accounts with our (awesome) accountants Vantis. We made 17k profit year ending March 2008. Buggered if I know where it is though. (Actually, it's on the balance sheet as retained earnings, but you know what I mean.) Our profit the year before was minus 84,000 so that's, you know, an improvement. Heh. Seriously, the minus 84000 came about because we had to put through a whacking great provision against returns of about 140,000. It also means that we have no tax to pay as the losses from last year carry over = good. 

I know these results are quite old now (end of March seems a long time ago) but it's good to know that we're holding up against the storms. And I'm quietly hoping that next year (this year, I suppose) will be even better. 

(Also, isn't it nice that I don't have to report these figures to a set of shareholders or City types. I doubt that saying 'buggered if I know where the profit is' to them would go down very well.)","","","","","2008-12-17","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","6"

Today's musing: why, if computers can perform complicated calculations in the blink of an eye, do they take ten minutes to start up? Ten minutes must be an eternity - what are they doing? 

Also, for some reason I couldn't stop thinking about an appraisal I had a B&Q.","It was a bad appraisal which immediately got me on the phone to recruitment agencies and resulted in me getting a job at Deloitte (and, incidentally, lost the Kingfisher group a resource that they had put about 150000 into in extra wages, training and so forth as I was on their hallowed Kingfisher Management Development Scheme). I had planned a range review for which I got a promotion, it was that good. Thing is, its implementation was completely ballsed up by store ops. So at my appraisal my manager conveniently forgot that she had raved about my range review and instead told me all the ways I had not done well. 

Managers: please recognise that corporate life is all a load of nonsense and that you can avoid getting completely suckered into it, and spread a little happiness, by always giving good appraisals - especially when they're due. What do you have to lose? Defy the machine. Be nice. Be human. It makes a difference to people's lives. And at the very least, don't leave any bad feedback until a half hour review meeting. Consider yourself a failure if you haven't let on to your staff at the time that they are underperforming. 

(Of course, if I hadn't been so appalled at that appraisal, and hadn't left, I may never have started Snowbooks. So all's well that ends well. Funny what you think about at 4am though.)","","","","2008-12-19","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

The other day I <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/12/history.html"">mentioned </a>finding a receipt for a new Ford Cortina among my late dad's papers. Another document of interest that I came across were the Woolworths Group Accounts for September of this year. My dad was on the board as a non-exec and he went into hospital so suddenly he certainly didn't have a chance to start locking away all his business paperwork. It's amazing to me to look at the corporate picture as recently as September. I probably shouldn't even make reference to what the accounts showed, but then on the other hand, it all seems a little bit academic now. But the picture painted is one of a stable but lacklustre business with a bit more debt than was ideal given how suddenly no one wants to lend money any more. It certainly wasn't a snapshot of a business three months from total oblivion. I can only assume that what I've read in the press is true: some key lenders wanted their money back at short notice and when no one else stepped forward to take over the debt, the company was hurriedly wound up. 28,000 people out of work just before Christmas, many of them going home to their families unpaid. And not because Woolworths went bust; simply because its bankers withdrew funds unexpectedly. I'll admit I'm biased, but personally I wouldn't have seen the harm in the government extending a six month loan of 250m. Perhaps one of the banks we all own shares in could have helped out with some of that cash. It wouldn't have needed to be a gift. There's every chance the business could have been transformed into something a little more in keeping with the current economic climate given a bit of breathing space. In fact I half expect that as the recession took hold, many new customers would have looked to Woolies for bargain bits and pieces. But it wasn't to be. So I just hope not all of those 28,000 people are having a miserable Christmas.","","","","","2008-12-21","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Book of Shadows - Author's Notes
I have long been fascinated by the idea of Witchcraft, and wanted to write a book based on the notion - What if there are Witches living among us, here and now, using real magic? This in turn set me thinking about Witches in times before our own, and how opinions have altered down the centuries. In Bess's time (the sixteen hundreds) cunning women, or those using hedge craft to heal, were often accused of malecficia, that is, the use of magic to attempt to bring about bad events or harm to others. From our twenty-first century perspective this seems like fear and superstition causing panic and injustice, and we accept that most of these women were harmless, and indeed in many cases effective healers. But then - What if some of those women were true Witches? This gave me my start point for Elizabeth's origins. 
By granting her immortality I was able to place her in other eras that I find fascinating. For me, there has always been a frisson of menace about Victorian London. It was a place of so much poverty and suffering, where the poor and the desperate rubbed shoulders with the wealthy but could only dream of the comfort and security their birth had assured them. The poorest, as always, were the most vulnerable, which is why I wanted Eliza (who of course had a strong social conscience) to live where she did, helping the prostitutes as best she could. I wanted to include Jack the Ripper as he symbolises all that was dangerous and cruel about the city as the century shuddered to a close.
I was particularly keen to position our heroine in the First World War. I wanted to see her tested to her limits, and to watch how she might be persuaded to use her magic to heal, whatever the personal cost. The very name Passchendaele conjures up suffering and emotion. The more I researched the third battle of Ypres, the conditions the troops and non-combatants endured, and the grim realities of the Field Hospitals, the more I knew Elise would be irresistibly drawn to such a place.
I was born in Dorset and although I moved to Wales when I was five I have spent many years visiting that part of England. I love the quintessentially English feel of the landscape. It is Thomas Hardy, and cream teas, and thatched cottages, and bucolic life, and all that is good and quiet and peaceful about the countryside. This setting, then, was the perfect foil for the darkness that continued to pursue Elizabeth and threatened both herself and Tegan.
I found writing Book of Shadows a wonderful and entirely consuming experience. My family had to put up with many long months of me going about with a distracted look on my face, or were forced to drag me away from one of the myriad books I devoured while researching. My children got used to all their bedtime stories being about Witches, or the seventeenth century, or medical procedures one hundred and twenty years ago. My son is now well informed on the weaponry of the Great War, and my daughter insists on dressing as a Witch for fancy dress parties. They are as thrilled as I am that Elizabeth's story is now going out into the world. I hope readers find themselves as bewitched as I was by the idea of secret magic being among us if only we care to look for it.

Points For Discussion
*  Gideon is a dark, unsympathetic character, and yet Bess found herself drawn to him. Why is there such a strong attraction to people we can see are bad, and did you, as a reader, find yourself repulsed or intrigued by Gideon?
*  How did you react to the Witch trials and surrounding procedures in the book?
*  One of the themes of Book of Shadows is identity and trying to pinpoint what makes us who we really are. Is there a pivotal moment or event where Elizabeth realises magic is an inextricable part of herself?
*  Names play an important role in the story. How are they used to reflect this theme of identity?
*  Bess never uses her magic for personal gain. What do you think about the choices she makes regarding her use of the Craft?
*  Why is Elizabeth's relationship with Tegan such a crucial one, both for her and for the story?
*  The early seventeenth century and the early twentieth century were both times of great political instability and upheaval, whereas Victoria's reign provided decades of growth and prosperity for many. Which period in history did you most enjoy in the book, and why?
*  The Passchendaele section is perhaps the most visceral part of the book. How did you find yourself responding to the horrors of wartime Flanders?
*   Put yourself in Elizabeth's place. Are there things you would have done differently?

For years I've thought of plastic as a dangerous luxury. Paper, on the other hand, seems natural, renewable and safe. Because it is simply wood in another form, it replenishes itself and if you discard it, its components rejoin the various cycles of earth and decay. I had fondly imagined, therefore, that paper was produced in a sustainable cycle. But like so many things, it's only sustainable if it's used with restraint. And the world has very little restraint when it comes to paper.

Mandy Haggith's very nicely written book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Paper-Trails-Trees-Trash-True/dp/0753513293/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229980967&sr=1-1"">Paper Trails</a>, confirms many of my worst fears. And then goes far beyond them. I had no idea how many old trees are cut down to make things that are immediately thrown away. Or that lots of recycled paper isn't really recycled, that lots of sustainable sources aren't sustainable, and that in far off lands, where there's money to be made, the clear-cutting of huge swathes of primeval, ancient forest is too lucrative to resist. It's bad enough to hack down pristine Amazonian rain forest, but at least that would grow back if we allowed it to. In the massive and ancient boreal forests of Northern Europe, where trees take hundreds of years to mature in the freezing conditions, new saplings often require the shelter of established trees to protect them. Hack down millenium-old virgin forest in that part of the world and it might never return.","I'm sure you don't want a reason to feel bad so close to Christmas, but on the other hand, any publishers reading this can do more than just feel guilty; we can scrutinise the provenance of the paper we use. When Em and I have finished reading up on this subject, we're certainly going take a closer look at where the pulp for our books comes from. I know Em has already worked hard to make sure we're doing the right thing, but it won't hurt to double-check. 

And for those of you interested in such things, Paper Trails covers a lot of interesting ground, including some fascinating details of traditional papermaking in China which uses plant fibre from sources other than trees. If beautiful, handmade paper can come from plant stalks, perhaps commercial paper could be produced from something which grows in fields annually rather than in forests over centuries. And as for using virgin forest to make junk mail which is dumped into landfill never having been opened, there has to be a better way.

... and the previously extremely fat goose has got a bit thinner. Now I'm more than half way towards my goal I can reveal the awful truth about my pregnancy weight gain.","Five (count 'em) stone, ladies and gentlemen. Yep. Heffer. I'm glad to report, however, that I've lost three of the buggers and have achieved my Christmas gift to myself of being only [mumblesomethingmutter] stone.

(Know that if you click 'Continue reading...' there will be spoilers for yesterday's Who.) Em kindly bought me <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Doctor-Who-Writers-Tale/dp/1846075718/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230291376&sr=8-1"">The Writer's Tale</a> as one of my Christmas presents. It's a collection of very honest e-mails where RTD, chief Who writer, talks about what goes on in his head and behind the scenes to get a Doctor Who script ready to shoot. I've been very surprised so far at how wise, eloquent and capable RTD evidently is. I've grumbled such a lot about the declining quality of Who that I was sure the book would be full of glib and/or dippy statements which would prove that the muddle that ends up on screen comes from the muddle in his head. But no. RTD thinks many of the same things I do about writing which, while it doesn't make them correct, means that they do seem awfully sensible to me. And he discusses and manipulates the components of story very well in his e-mails. It's much like the way I work in the notes I use to plan out a story, but if anything his thoughts are more fluent and clear than mine. This, as you can imagine, is a bit of a blow. I've looked at the slightly shabby end-product of an RTD script and imagined that I could do better. But now I'm not quite so sure.","What if RTD is a sound writer, and it's the process of turning scripts into finished episodes that causes the magic to evaporate, leaving only lots of pointless running, interspersed with big, confusing plot chunks? I'm only fifty pages in, and it's a big meaty book, so maybe my opinion of RTD will dwindle as it goes on, but I've been impressed by the insights so far into the mind of someone I expected to be dismissive of.

But that said, the Christmas Day Who didn't wow me. Apart from some fun CGI of a skscraper-tall cyber-robot blasting the buildings below I don't think I sat forward in my chair once. Or laughed. And David Tennant can usually sift comedy gold out of the drossiest script.

Despite RTD's apparent understanding of story, he didn't really set up his characters for The Other Doctor. Everyone apart from Jackson Lake felt so sketchy. In fact it was ironic that the episode featured cybermen because almost everyone in the story seemed like they were following programming rather than reacting to events. Rosita was plucky and full of herself, but it was like she'd stepped out of another story. She's there fighting aliens and talking back to the Doctor: a fully-formed companion bursting onto the scene, before gradually retreating into the background, leaving us with very little idea of what was going on in her head, or what was driving her. She seemed to be robbed of purpose once the Doctor was up to speed, which isn't the greatest arc for a bold and energetic character to follow. 

Miss Hartigan operated in much the same way: an implacable super-villain with a deadly mind who is simply there, no real explanation offered, bossing around cybermen and exacting revenge upon Victorian gentlemen whose relationship to her is difficult to grasp. And those gentlemen were being culled and herded why? Because they alone could lead the children from the workhouses they ran into the cybermen's lair to turn capstans and carry buckets, which after a few hours would provide the last bit of power the giant robot needed to activate itself. Really? As sketchy plots go, that's alarmingly arbitrary and thin.The cybermen couldn't have just grabbed the kids themselves or rounded up some brawny adults to be their slaves? Or found a power source that didn't involve manual labour? And Miss Hartigan had been killing people for weeks (still not sure why) culminating in murdering the one man whose funeral would bring the four workhouse owners together, thus allowing her to capture the people she says have walked past her on the street so many times. It's so intricate and yet so nonsensical. But perhaps Miss Hartigan had her reasons, though it would have been nice if she'd let us in on the secret.

Jackson Lake was a little better defined than the rest. For a start, he had actual motivation for his actions. Unfortunately, from the point of view of empathising with him, hiding his true motivations was part of the mystery of act one, so we were left for a while with guest characters who were all simply serving the ridiculous plot. But Jackson's story was quite poetic: the bereaved and despairing man clutching at another identity to escape his pain. And it was fun trying to work out who he was (while praying that we weren't supposed to take him seriously as a future incarnation of the Doctor). But a good mystery should give you all the clues while still leaving you foxed, and then reveal itself, producing a real moment of revelation. We didn't have most of the clues, so while the mystery was fun, the payoff didn't fire on all cylinders.

All in all, the episode seemed small without being intimate (because we didn't understand most of the characters or much of the plot) and then suddenly we were looking at a giant robot striding above the houses, which rescued the programme from feeling like it was shot for thruppence.

I know plots in shows like this don't need to be cast iron, but if they're complicated then they do sort of need to hang together. If you want to gloss over the logic then don't get too specific. RTD plots often seem pedantically concerned with details which don't connect together at all well. These 'infostamps' are data storage canisters that the cybermen use, which can be turned into deadly weapons for killing them simply by snapping the tops off? That's a bit of a design flaw, isn't it? Because if they'd only left their cyberman iPods at home, they'd be indestructible. And Jackson Lake worked out how to convert them into weapons with what he learned from the Doctor's database? And yet he picked up nothing else about technology at all, leaving him battling aliens with rope, a screwdriver and a balloon. Moreover, he somehow picked up some of the current Doctor's speech patterns (e.g. 'Allons-y') without taking in the pictures of his face. I think if your plotlines are filled with exceptions which make no sense, except in that they help the story along, then you need to conceal all that under lashings of spectacle, drama and wit. The latter two of which this story needed a lot more of.

But I have to say, the attitude I have now to Doctor Who is of a sportscar which has been sold to a new owner but not yet handed over. All RTD has to do is not run it into a lamp post before Steven Moffat gets behind the wheel and all will be well (I hope). So on that basis, yesterday's Who was a relief. Flawed, frustrating and flat in places, but not woeful, and not likely to drive so many viewers away that the franchise is endangered. Roll on 2010.

<em>Update</em>: I'm a little further into <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Doctor-Who-Writers-Tale/dp/1846075718/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230291376&sr=8-1"">The Writer's Tale</a> now and RTD is talking more and more about the pressure, the depression, his druggy and boozy past, his inability to start writing until almost the last possible moment and then the chaotic scramble to get the script finished. That, perhaps, begins to explain why someone with apparently good instincts and skills could keep fumbling whole episodes. He also talks of poor Helen Raynor, the writer of the awful Daleks in Manhattan double-bill, physically trembling with shock after spending two hours reading just how much some fans hated her episodes. It's difficult to know what to think about that. The episodes <em>were</em> awful, but it's terrible to think of a writer directly exposed to so much negative hyperbole that instead of improving she's almost too afraid to write any more (though it didn't stop her delivering another appalling double episode next season, so perhaps my sympathy should be qualified). I suppose the blame for putting her in that position should go to the producers who didn't spot they'd been handed and were filming a dud. Still it must be a horrible experience, being savaged for your best efforts. It makes me wonder whether I'd actually want to put myself through it, given the opportunity.

<em>Update</em>: I have to recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Doctor-Who-Writers-Tale/dp/1846075718/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230291376&sr=8-1"">The Writer's Tale</a> to anyone interested in how a story comes together - assuming you like Doctor Who, of course: it would be a bit pointless if you weren't a fan. It's an enormous (and very nicely typeset and compiled) book, full of wise words, as well as plausible ideas in which you can see the seeds of folly. But annoyingly for me, reading the scripts and listening to the thought processes behind them, I wonder whether I would have spotted the problems ahead. I can watch an episode and see that it's chaotic and too childish (or alternatively too bleak) and ultimately unsatisfying, but I've been reading the scripts, and learning about all the incremental tweaks that were made, and I'm not 100% sure I would I have spotted those flaws <em>at that stage</em>. That's troubling. Will I have to let RTD off the hook for his many howlers? The only thing I can say for sure is he really could have done better with his dialogue in a lot of places. I can now see that RTD has some great instincts and some excellent self-imposed guidelines for writing, but he doesn't push himself hard enough to come up with original but realistic lines for his actors to say. And his standards for what makes sense in plot terms are definitely on the low side. But then if you aim to write five or six episodes a year, as well as extensively rewrite as many more, and supply the ideas for those others (all except Steven Moffat's) - and that's on top of lots of exec producer duties - then you'd better be organised and use your time effectively. And sadly for RTD he's more of a panicker and a last-minute-scribbler. I can't help wondering what his scripts would have been like if he'd got to work in good time. Better? The same? Dull? <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Doctor-Who-Writers-Tale/dp/1846075718/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230291376&sr=8-1"">The Writer's Tale</a> is excellent food for thought if you write for a living and lean towards exuberant yarn spinning.","","","","2008-12-26","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

It's not a proper blog, though, really - it's just my journal of all things Ro (with the occasional comment of what it's like working from home with a baby as I currently do, which I thought might be interesting) before he suddenly hits 18 and I've forgotten how he grew up, so don't bother visiting unless you can stomach All Baby Photos, All The Time.

There is one feature of the too-numerous-to-remember businesses falling into administration which I keep noticing. All the businesses were doing more or less OK until recently, but a combination of poor Xmas sales and a retraction of credit lines means that their demise is astonishingly rapid. It only takes one bad season - one poor Xmas quarter's trading, one really bad batch of returns, one pulled overdraft - and that's it. Bullet to the head. You can't stockpile enough cash to see you all the way through a bad year, so really there's no security. This is the feeling I've always had with Snowbooks: we've done fine but every time we have a good season / title I think 'yes, but that's in the past' - it's next week's sales which matter, not last week's. Maybe there's something to be said for being paranoid like this  - we're always in survival mode, not just in times of recession, so there's no complacency. I suspect more and more businesses are starting to think like me, now.","","","","","2008-12-31","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

Wanting to start the year on an innovative foot, here's a new thing. 

I have created a new blog, <a href=""http://www.snowsales.co.uk"">www.snowsales.co.uk</a>, which contains password-protected Snowbooks sales data. As I mention in its first post: 
<em>
Were providing data on this blog because its a cheap, easy to maintain and quick way to improve our authors experience with Snowbooks. We also would like to make our data available to others for benchmarking or study purposes. Whilst some company data is indeed commercially sensitive, we dont think that you can do much harm to our company by knowing our sales data. Indeed, we think that by being open and sharing data we can all benefit:
<strong>
Authors -</strong> you can keep an eye on whether your local stores are ordering, or let us know if you think there are additional opportunities were not getting. Plus you can get a feel for how your book is selling rather than waiting for the 6 monthly royalty statements, or trying to figure out the Amazon rankings algorithm. You can also benchmark your books performance against other Snowbooks titles. 
<strong>Fellow publishers - </strong>you can benchmark your sales against ours, to see if there are any stores we sell to who might like your books, and vice versa. If you see any gaps in our customer base, reciprocate and let us know! 
<strong>Students -</strong> weve been asked a number of times for actual data to help students understand the realities of publishing, so we hope this helps you to become better publishers when you graduate. Do acknowledge us in your essays and projects if you find these data useful.</em>

The Barnes household had the best Christmas ever this year. It was a truly wonderful Christmas day and we've had a brilliant two weeks. But boy, am I glad to be back at work.","It's lovely to lounge around all day, of course, for a bit. But I was starting to get a bit crazy by the end of the hols. And actually I was at my desk or in meetings for at least a few hours every day except Xmas day, so it's not like I was overdoing the r&r. But no email coming in, no new projects to get excited about, no-one at the end of the phone to discuss ongoing issues and projects with meant that it was rather quiet. This week, the email's started flowing, we're getting some great ideas in from authors and potential partners, the bank is open again so I can indulge my OCD need to phone them to check our cash flow, and I'm full of optimism about this year. It's all about opportunities - talking to and emailing people makes opportunity bubble up out of nowhere, and an absence of conversation means no opportunities present themselves. 

And before you say 'but you've got a little baby; doesn't he fill your day?' Well he sits, stands, plays, eats and sleeps on or near me all day regardless of whether I'm at my desk or on the sofa. And I'm finding that I can enjoy him as well as my work. I read him submissions out loud; he critiques the colours of my cover designs; we talk, laugh (and sometimes sing) all day long. Indeed, as I found towards the end of Christmas, to be happy I really need my job more than ever and I'm very lucky I can combine my two loves. (My one handed typing is coming along very well, too. This post is all my solo left hand's work and has only taken five minutes. What was that film where the baddie did excellent standing up, fast, one handed typing? Was it a James Bond? That's me, but without the urge to take over the world. Probably.) I think this work life balance thing is working out very well.","","","","2009-01-07","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

Amazingly we have 165 followers. It's interesting because unlike this blog I have no idea who's reading as so few of you comment. With Twitter I can view the profiles of people. You're a varied bunch, and I note a number of authors among you. Make sure you submit your work to us, especially horror and fantasy, as we're actively looking.

So for the first time in my adult life I have an interest in children's books. Indeed, I already know a few of them off by heart. Here are my reviews of some of the ones we've read so far.","Ro's favourite is <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stick-Man-Julia-Donaldson/dp/1407106171/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232094907&sr=8-1"">Stick Man.</a> The things he looks for in a book at the moment are nice colours and shapes, and how the words sound. Stick Man has a nice lilting, rhyming story and the pictures are bright, with a lot of white space. Two thumbs up (if Ro had control of his thumbs yet). 

Another favourite is <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gruffalo-Julia-Donaldson/dp/033396568X/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232095063&sr=1-3"">The Gruffalo</a>. He likes the physical book as much as the story - our edition is the board book and his fingers like to explore the edges of the boards and open the pages. 

<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Snowy-Night-Tales-Percys-Park/dp/0007146930/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1232096277&sr=1-1"">One Snowy Night </a>hasn't gone down very well so far. I think the images are too pastelly for him at the moment. <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Aliens-Love-Underpants-Claire-Freedman/dp/1416917055/ref=pd_sim_b_2"">Aliens Love Underpants</a> has similarly bombed.

You know me. I'm quite handy with the ol' computer. Well, the last twenty minutes make me look like a person who's never come across one in their life before. See, I've been trying to format a report in Sage.","The Sage boffins (let's call them) have created an entire Report Designer tool, that allows you to insert various fields and change styles and fonts to suit. Very good of them. Thing is, it doesn't work according to any principles of modern computing. Want to change a font? It's no good selecting the text, silly. No, you have to select the text box that the text is in, and apply formatting to that. Want to insert an image? Well, alright then, but only if it's all distorted. Want to figure out which fields to insert? Well here's a list of about two thousand possible fields, all called something like COMINVPRC or DEL_ADD_COMP1. Why call sales value 'sales value' when you can call it INVOICE.FOREIGN_INVOICE_GROSS_UNSIGNED.

"42059","","1","Digital publishing","Draft","true","The phrase has an unhelpful vagueness. 'Digital publishing' - what is it? Publishing via digital media? Publishing in the digital age? Publishing of books using a digital process? I thought I'd giwrite down what I think of as digital publishing and see if you agree.","In my mind, digital publishing is split into two distinct areas. One, the rendering of writing on electronic devices. Two, the use of computers and technology to publish printed, or otherwise, books. 

The first area is where everyone gets very excited, because that's where all the speculation takes place about devices. Which device is going to be the iPod of the booktrade? Are ebooks any good? Who's publishing books for reading on mobile phones? When will Apple launch the large screen iPhone? It's also of greatest interest because the answers to these questions have a bearing on whether publishers today will exist tomorrow. If your model is to print lots of copies of books, but the market shifts to ebooks, then you're going to have a bit of a problem. So it's right and proper that publishers should be interested in devices. 

However, it's the second area in my mind that is of the most immediate interest - the use of technology to create and publish printed books. If done properly and innovatively, any work you do in this area will allow you to easily publish books destined for print electronically, too. I'm talking about everything from using the Adobe suite of software to lay out beautiful books and produce a print-ready PDF, to using ONIX data to accurately disseminate bibliographic data around the world. There are two great things about this sort of digital publishing: you can have total control, and you can do it very cheaply. 

Take ONIX data, for instance. Sure, you can give Vista or one of the larger software houses 25,000 to write you an all singing, all dancing solution, but you can also do it for a grand or even absolutely free if you write your own solution.ONIX is just a language standard; a set of definitions","","","","2009-01-18","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

I'm never quite sure what to blog about these days. The reason I like the idea of publishing is not so much that I like books (though goodness knows I own enough of them) but that I like what's inside books. I like escaping into a story and I love learning things. But that's storytelling and the whole wide world of knowledge; most of it has little or nothing to do with the art and act of publishing and so isn't necessarily of direct interest to anyone who comes to this page. Most of it has nothing to do with any of our titles; it's much more to do with what's going on in my head. And the feedback we get often focuses on what people don't like rather than what they do which puts tentative crosses against a few of my regular topics but doesn't add any.","That's not to say I don't have facts and theories to share about publishing, but because of the way my brain works they tend to be either unashamedly* technical explorations of publishing processes or highly abstract musings on how the strategy of media industries might evolve. And these aren't things that light most people's fires. In fact that sort of thing might even be driving some of you away, which would make it a very questionable use of my time.

But I do think some visitors are interested in the mechanics of storytelling, so I might continue to kick that subject around. I'm particularly wrapped up in learning about screenwriting at the moment and I think that world has a lot to teach mainstream novel writers, both by positive example and by cautionary tale. Otherwise, I think I'm probably without blogging portfolio at the moment. So if any of the things I've written about in the last few years suddenly gives you an idea of what you'd like to encounter more of here, then please comment away. In the meantime, it's time to start a new post and share with you my feelings about the TV show Demons.

That logo should say 'Shine'. Not sure why it's so difficult to make out that fourth letter. Perhaps it's my cruel satire on the quality of their work. Anyway, Shine is the TV production company who made 'Hex' and now they're making 'Demons' which is currently showing on ITV. And sadly Demons is complete Shine.","It's interesting to look at these squanderings of money and talent and try to work out what went wrong. Demons has several good actors in it (exact estimates vary) but surely <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0322562/"">Philip Glenister</a>'s grumpy magnificence is enough to make the fluffiest of confections seem like they have a satisfyingly nourishing centre to them.

Or so I would have thought. But he's forced to speak in an American accent which seems to take all the bite out of his usual snarky mumble. And he's given only complete twaddle to say. As are all the characters. I remember Harry Hill once doing a skit about constructing whole conversations from empty cliches; this is like that. Mix hackneyed transantlanticisms with lazy attempts at Brit teenspeak and you've got Demons dialogue: 'Get over it, alright', 'You wish', 'No way', 'Shut up', 'This isn't happening', 'Later', 'Whatever'.

I imagine there must have been some debate about the choice of Christian Cooke as the teen hero.

And I imagine the conversation went like this:
A: ""He's not ready to carry a show."" 
B: ""But look at his jawline.""
A:  ""He seems wooden: he can only do confused or angry (much like <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1303956/"">Freema Agyeman</a>).""
B: ""But he looks great and will probably be a good actor one day (much like Freema Agyeman).""
A: We can't wait that long.
B: Yeah, but unlike Freema, he can wander around without his shirt on the whole time.
A: Oh, alright. Here's four hundred quid. Make me six episodes.

So the definite weaknesses I can spot are the recycled dialogue, some questionable casting, and (oh yes) the plots. They have some of the elements of fun genre thrillers, but they have none of the discipline that's also needed. And while all plots everywhere are in some sense derivative, these seem more like cut-and-paste than most. The basic premise is so close to a copy of Buffy The Vampire Slayer that coincidence couldn't possibly account for it, and yet it's copied all the wrong things: there's no dash, none of the humour is funny and the character moments come across as speeches rather than tugs on your heart strings. 

In terms of plot recycling, the series has barely started and there's already a sequence involving defusing a bomb which comes down to which colour wire to cut (go <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma"">here </a>for a fun discussion of movie bomb disposal down the ages. All screenwriters should be forced to read that post and repent. Also note in the 'Live Action TV' examples, a reference to the fabulous twist on bomb disposal from Life On Mars, featuring Philip Glenister's most famous alter ego). 

In Demons, the girl who's faced with the classic red LEDs counting down has enough time to start reading books on electronics and bomb disposal - one of which (I swear) has instructions on which colour wire to cut (as though bomb-making requires you to use standard colour codes). She has forty minutes to get the one person in danger out of the way or to call the bomb squad. And since she's half-disassembled the bomb without it going off, she has plenty of time pop it in a shopping bag and drop it off Blackfriars bridge into the Thames. But no: she stays with the bomb and dithers and emotes for half an hour. As various wise men, such as Neal Stephenson and Roger Ebert have observed, a plot that requires its characters to behave like morons is not a good plot.

And I suppose it goes without saying that the action scenes intended to form the climax of each show are dull, unconvincing and over in seconds. I mean if I never see another person strapped into a harness and hoisted up on a wire - on the theory it will make it look like they're highly acrobatic - then it'll be too soon. Even <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0950759/"">Woo-ping Yuen</a> (the guy who supervised the wire work for The Matrix) screws up occasionally. It does not surprise me that ITV fell a little short of his standard. No British TV show should ever attempt wire work because the results will be rubbish. (For an insight into one of the few Western films to make wire work look realistic, go <a href=""http://fxguide.com/article480.html"">here </a>and scroll down to 'flying'.)

As a writer, the thing that worries me about all this, though, is not that yet another British TV attempt at cool has fallen flat but that maybe this stuff looked tolerably entertaining when it was still in script form. Did the jokes seem funny back then? Did the fight scenes play out well in the writer's head? On the page, were these real characters whose emotions you could empathise with and whose highs and lows might move you? 

I hate the thought that sharp writing becomes muddled TV once it's worked its way through the sausage-making production pipeline with all the tone meetings and 'notes' and actor's 'choices' and budget considerations and director's interpretations and final editing decisions. I think there's no doubt that Demons suffers from low production values and uninspiring direction. But is it possible that the writers turned in a good product that other people ruined.

I'm relieved to say 'no'. I'm pretty sure that scripts of this quality would never make it onto a network TV show in the States. You'd be told to go away and work on your 'craft' for another few years perhaps as a junior writer on a successful show. My conclusion is that the bar is just set a lot lower in the UK. It's a shame for all the viewers and licence-payers out there. But of course for writers it's a golden opportunity. If ITV will make someone else's shabby and underwritten genre show, then why shouldn't they make mine? I'm not being rhetorical there either. Really, why shouldn't they?","","","","2009-01-30","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

[<em>Update</em>: it's been pointed out to me that this DVD will play in any DVD player, not just an American one.]","What's particularly nice about the Dr Horrible DVD is that it has making-of featurettes, and a commentary track which is as funny as the mini-movie itself, though admittedly it helps if you know something about the people speaking (like Joss, or <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0277213/"">Nathan Fillion</a> (star of <em>Firefly</em>) or <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000439/"">Neil Patrick Harris</a> (from <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>)).

Be warned, despite all the fun and songs, the story is sad, but everything else about the project is happy-making. Own it.

Oh, and just to give you some context: this is what Joss and his buddies (and brothers) did during the Writers' Strike when they weren't picketing.

<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2009/01/demons.html"">I was saying</a> cruel and hurtful things about <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1157595/"">Demons </a>recently (that's the lazy ITV copy of <em>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</em>). The good news is that it's getting better. The last episode was boring and predictable but not laugh-out-loud bad. What a coup.

I'll tell you what <em>is </em>good, though: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_Human_(TV_series)"">Being Human</a>. I didn't plan to watch it after reading the premise which was: a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost share a flat. Eeek. What a horrible, horrible idea. It made me think of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentaghost"">Rentaghost</a>, a very annoying kids' program from the Eighties about a house full of ghosts that still makes me grind my teeth with its pointless shoddiness. The only way they could have made the concept for <em>Being Human</em> sound worse is if it were: 'A vampire, a werewolf and a ghost go into a pub...' Of course, having said that, you won't be surprised to hear that <em>Being Human</em> is marvellous. Very mature (definitely not suitable for kids). It's also funny, exciting and altogether unexpected, with surprisingly intense moments of drama, and every character is intriguingly idiosyncratic and watchable (with the possible exception of a few moments of Russell Tovey going a little broad occasionally, but that's nitpicking).","I didn't see the original one-off show in Feb, 2008. I wish I had, but now that they've recast two of the three leads - and I really like their choices - I sort of don't want to see other people play those characters.

<em>Being Human</em> is as perplexing to me in its own way as <em>Demons</em>. Why is <em>Being Human</em> so gripping? (And <em>Demons </em>so bad?) After all, it's mainly talking. There's the odd visual action sequence, like George turning from human to werewolf, but I'm definitely not waiting for those moments. In fact they almost feel like a slight pause in the story. <em>Being Human</em> has achieved something almost instantly that <em>Demons </em>has no idea how to do: it's made me care about the characters. Why does a lot of talking from one vampire equal compelling drama (on <em>Being Human</em>) whereas some other vampire nattering away bores and irritates me in equal parts (true of almost every character on <em>Demons</em>)? I'd like to have an answer that's more specific than just 'the writing is incomparably better on <em>Being Human</em>'.","","","","2009-02-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

<em>6. Fixed width web page not sitting in centre of windowGot a fixed width website and can't get it to centrally align in the window in Internet Explorer? Or you can get it to centrally align in IE but not in any other browser? Fear not, it's not your fault! Unfortunately, the correct way of centrally aligning content through CSS doesn't actually work in IE:

#container {
width: 770px;
margin: 0 auto
} 

The second command, margin: 0 auto, basically gives our containing element an automatic margin on the left and right, thereby positioning the containing element in the centre of the browser window.

IE however, will need slightly different commands to make this work:

body {
text-align: center
}
#container {
width: 770px;
margin: 0 auto;
text-align: left
} 

This will then centrally align the container in IE too. To prevent the text from centrally aligning too, we insert text-align: left into the container div.</em>

This is a bit anecdotal, but every day I read in the paper about jobs lost and profits evaporating. And I read about prices slashed and record discounts offered. But strangely, I haven't managed to pay less for anything yet. Not that I look upon a recession just as a way of snapping up some bargains. I just find it strange that nothing I've wanted to buy in the last few months has been reduced. Perhaps I'm buying the 'wrong' things. But weirdly, my mum is trying to buy a new car at the moment and we all know that the car industry is really struggling with its mountains of unsold inventory.","She's visited dealers for four different makes of car and none of them were interested in doing any sort of deal on a mid-sized SUV. Full list price only. The fifth dealership did offer her a deal, which was scuppered by the fact that they were out of stock of what she wanted and couldn't find any stock anywhere else in the UK.

They were rubbish when I was little.","Then in the Nineties, with all the supercomputers and mathematical modelling, they started to get accurate. Then, in this decade, they've gone back to being fifty-fifty guesses. Worse, because we live in a web-savvy age, these inaccurate forecasts exist almost solely as icons. I've checked Yahoo, versus the BBC, versus what my Mac tells me and none of them agree. What's more some of the little picturegrams are almost too inscrutable to interpret.

I imagine every time I type the word 'capitalism' the SnowBlog readership dips like the Dow, but in my defence, the question of which brand of capitalism is best seems to be at the heart of our current economic recession/depression/hiccup. Capitalism is powerful, but it's capable of doing as much harm as good. It can use up resources and leave all but a minority poor if we let it. Or it can be modified so that it tows the whole economy towards prosperity. It's a much slower journey, as we see in Socialist-leaning countries, where they make sure to keep their capitalism on a leash. Prosperity takes a lot longer that way than letting the beast off the leash, but now, just as in the Great Depression, we're surveying the damage that's caused when the beast runs wild. It's like one of those big trolls that pull open the gates of Mordor in the Lord of the Rings movies: very handy, but you don't want them getting drunk or throwing tantrums. And it's not just me who thinks like this. Naomi Klein has a little piece <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/feb/06/global-recession-backlash"">in the Guardian today</a> about ordinary people in a smattering of recession-hit nations who are starting to care about these things, mainly as a result of watching their countries slide into debt and depression. As she points out, many of us would prefer the government bail out the victims of this crash and not its instigators. Yes, it's a bit socialist, but that doesn't seem like such a bad thing once the boom is over.","","","","","2009-02-06","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

I could believe one SnowBlog commenter might have fond memories of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentaghost"">Rentaghost</a>, but not two. That's like 25% of you or something. Could this be the rosy-tinted rear porthole of nostalgia that everyone now seems to view their childhood TV through? Similar to the effect that made me think <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Boy"">Marine Boy</a> was excellent until finally it was reshown and I realised it didn't even make sense (though I still want OxyGum and Jet Boots). My memories of Rentaghost are of thinking how cool the idea of ghosts was - basically they were like indestructible superheroes (c.f. original Randall & Hopkirk, which I loved) - and being so disappointed that all they did was bicker in overly loud voices and make mistakes*. I will admit it was good to start with, but it outstayed its welcome by quite a number of years as far as I was concerned. Here's an excerpt from the Wikipedia entry that backs me up: <scan style=""font-family: courier;"">'The acting in later episodes was frequently over the top, and the scripts contained highly-contrived jokes...'</span>

Is the new Kindle any good? Will it truly smell like a book? Will it be waterproof enough to drop in the bath - perhaps swelling up to twice its size but still being readable? Will it have the indefinable magic of paper books? And which of these questions is sarcasm masquerading as proper humour? All of them? None? If everyone in the world were forced to vote on whether Kindles should entirely replace all paper books, what would they choose? Or is that a false choice? Will gadgets like the Kindle in fact nibble away at paper book sales for years to come, gradually gaining ground - grabbing a gadget-fan here, a frequent-flier thriller reader there? Will this be the first eBook reader that makes a real dent in the market or will it be the next Kindle or Sony Reader, or the eventual Apple entry into the field?

I've heard that betting shops do perfectly well in a recession. Had it survived, I suspect Woolworths might have been nicely placed too. What about bookshops? Are books luxuries that you cut back on, as opposed to necessities like food, shelter and iPhones? Or are books cheap and simple: good value when trips out or holidays abroad might overstretch your budget? I haven't got any historic data for the recessionproofedness* of books. But some of you guys must be terribly <del>old</del> experienced and wise. Are recessions good, bad or irrelevant for bookstores and publishing companies?

If you follow the link in the last post to the Adobe bookshop you won't see an image that looks quite like the thumbnail I provided. That's because I faked a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_shift"">tilt-shift camera</a> look in Photoshop. Then I thought some of you might want to know how to do that (I had to ask the internets for help; it wasn't me being brilliant). My first thought was to apply an adjustment layer and then put a gradient across that layer's mask so that the blur varied in strength from one side of the image to the other. Then I noticed that there is no adjustment layer for blur (at least in the version of Photoshop I was using). Instead what you can do is duplicate the image layer and blur it all. Make the blur the maximum blur you want to see on the finished image. Make sure the blurred layer is on top and then add a mask layer to it and put a gradient across that. I've provided an example if you keep reading.","I don't know whether you like the effect or not, but I grabbed a street scene from this <a href=""http://altamiranyc.blogspot.com/2007/10/on-lafayette-and-kenmare.html"">blog</a>.

Once you've clicked on both links, hit backspace and then shift-backspace to flip between the versions.

I used a gradient that goes from white to black to white again on the layer mask so as to lift the woman out of the background. It's pretty simple, you just need to play with your gradients and pick photos where distance from the lens tends to shift in some simple way across the photo.

Do you have an iPhone? I see more and more of them everyday. Plus I love mine to an unreasonable extent. Originally, I upgraded my old phone to a brand new 'iPhone killer' (an HTC Touch HD, supposedly capable of doing everything an iPhone can, but better and more of it). Despite heaps of ecstatic reviews, I hated it. Nothing worked the way I thought it would. And even once I'd worked out how to do something, the touchscreen seemed to ignore me half the time. And then I tried an actual iPhone and it was night and day. It was intuitive, satisfying and fun. And I very quickly found myself making excuses for the things it did badly. Plus with the iPhone, you can easily add extra little programs to make it do new things. Some of those add-on apps are really amazing. But <a href=""http://www.formationalliance.com/index.php?id=39"">here's one</a> that will surely only really please publishers. It's called 'Kern' and it's a game in which your goal is to correct the letter-spacing in a word. I'm betting this makes Em want an iPhone. Or maybe not, because after all she has real books to lay out. What's really needed I suppose is a way to make doing real layouts fun. Well, I'm sure there'll be an iPhone app along for that soon.","","","","","2009-02-18","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","8"

I've said some harsh things about Horizon before. It was the science program of my youth and it was so full of info I'd have to get books out of the library to puzzle it out. It looked at black holes and quarks and the origin of the universe. Now it's self-consciously shot and almost content-free, and tackles diet fads and homeopathy. But last night they slipped up and broadcast a show that didn't insult my intelligence.

I was expecting to cringe, but I thought it was time to give Horizon another chance. And I was surprised and delighted by their look at generating electricity from hydrogen fusion. The show wasn't as dense with theory as in the olden days, which is fine, because it was absorbing nevertheless, and for once the self-consciously abstract camerawork didn't seem like padding in a show already full of padding. No, instead all the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh"">boke </a>and lens flares did what they were supposed to do: give you a moment or two to think about what had just been said.","I think the key was that it was narrated (and I assume largely written) by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_(physicist)"">Prof. Brian Cox</a>, who looks like he should be in a band (he actually was in D:Ream ! !). He's forty and looks about twenty-eight, and holds a physics professorship at the University of Manchester, which means he looks a TV presenter but can talk comfortably about quantum mechanics and fundamental forces. Unlike the BBC's usual Quentins and Julians whose art history degrees leave them fumbling when they find themselves producing Horizon and writing science-based voiceovers.

And the content of the show didn't suck either. If we can make power stations that run on hydrogen fusion, we can power the world without wrecking the climate or needing to fight over the last drops of oil. I'd understood that fusion research had stalled, but this program makes it sound like it's alive and kicking, and just possibly on the way to rescuing us.

Brits can watch the show again <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00hr6bk/Horizon_20082009_Can_We_Make_a_Star_on_Earth/"">here</a> if they're quick.

You know when you arrive in a new country, your cell phone will often get a text message from whichever local network your phone has logged onto. I've just been playing with the phone I used last time I was in the States and noticed one of those. What's cool about it, is that it's for a Canadian phone network and says 'Enjoy your stay in Canada'. Well, I didn't visit Canada. I just flew over it for a couple of hours. Bad me for not correctly engaging flight mode on that phone.

Or maybe RyanAir will replace all of their aircraft with a new type that's immune to mobile phone usage. Or just possibly mobile phones never were bad for airplanes - after all, you can turn off the phones but not the giant cell phone towers on the ground. I've never liked it when companies decide to tell us obvious lies - particularly companies we trust with our lives. (And despite their insistence that I should listen to the flight safety announcement because they are 'periodically updated' they never are. It's always the same announcement I've been hearing since I was five.)","<hr/>

<em>Only quibblers need read on</em>:

In theory, the type of picocell used on board a plane would allow mobile phones to make calls at very low power outputs. But then power output of a phone during a call is much higher than one on standby. So it's difficult to see why currently no phones must be switched on, but in the future phones making low-power calls will be allowed.","","","","2009-02-20","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Everything about child-rearing is contentious. I have lost count of the number of times I've put my foot in it regarding breastfeeding, education, nappies... everyone's way is The Right Way and to suggest otherwise is akin to a slap in the face, it seems. So chances are, if you're a mother, you're not going to like this.","As you know I adore Ro to absolute bits; I find him enchanting and love spending time with him. I can't believe how quickly he learns, how perky and bright he is, how every day he changes and grows. Already he's tottering around the place on his feet (well supported of course) and is vocal and knows his own mind. He's completely amazing and I've never been so in love or so happy. 

But I don't know what I'd do without my work. It brings a structure to our days that I find invaluable. It helps me to wake up by getting my brain going when otherwise I'll loll on the sofa, half-asleep, after a long night's parenting. It gets me out to see people, with Ro in his sling along for the ride. It brings me pride, interest, continuity and fun. 

The bottom line is this. Far from agreeing with well-meaning people who advise me that it's impossible to work and look after a baby full-time, I would ask how it's possible to *only* look after a baby full time. I am extremely lucky in that I can fit my work around Ro - it wouldn't do to take him into an office every day, of course. But I would be interested to hear from other people what they did when their children were tiny. Did you write a novel? Work? Set up a business? I am sure that there are people out there who feel, like me, that it's perfectly possible to combine childcare with brain work.","","","","2009-02-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

It's been great to hear all the positive feedback about our <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2009/02/early_birds.html"">Interesting Experiment</a>. Your comments on this blog and on your own have been fascinating, and I'd like to incorporate some of your thoughts into this experiment. 

<a href=""http://eoinpurcellsblog.com/2009/02/20/snowbooks-pull-a-genius-one/"">Eoin</a>, for instance, wonders whether we could take it a step further and use this as a way to involve readers more in the process of creating a book. I love that idea, although I don't want to force people to have to spend money to give us useful feedback. So - if you send in proofreading notes for any of our proofs that you buy from Lulu, or give us some detailed, considered feedback, then I will refund you the price of the book. How's about that. Don't take the mick and point out one typo, though!","","","","","2009-02-21","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

I have 9 GCSEs, four A levels, one degree and one postgrad diploma and I am at an utter loss to know how I got them since the internet hadn't been invented. It truly is a thing of wonder.

One small tool I use to improve my efficiency is Quick Parts in my mail program, Outlook. At the click of a button, pre-written and formatted text can be inserted into an email. It works great for the sorts of emails I have to send lots of. I thought you might be interested - and slightly horrified - to see some of the Quick Parts I use.","Here's the text I send to agents who have submitted a manuscript that we reject:

<em>""Hello

Many thanks indeed for thinking of us with this one. Im afraid it doesnt quite work for me, but sincere thanks for letting me read it and look forward to keeping in touch. 

All the best, 

Emma"" </em>

And here's the rejection note I send out to authors: 

<em>""Hi there

Many thanks for the submission. Im afraid its not one for us, but very best of luck with your writing. 

All the very best, 

Emma"" </em>

Here's the one I use most frequently:

""Hi Team 2  please can you process the following gratis order? Many thanks, Emma""

Here's a couple I use at least twice a day each:

<em>""Hi there

Thanks for your enquiry. You don't need to query Snowbooks; just follow the instructions at www.snowbooks.com/submissions.html. 

Many thanks, Emma"" </em>

<em>""Thanks for the email. So sorry, but we have no plans to hire or run work experience programmes at any time in the next few years. Sincere thanks for the very kind words, though, and all the best of luck with things, 

Emma""</em>

Are you appalled at me for having such stock answers to people's heartfelt queries - especially authors and hopeful job applicants? Should I hand craft a tailored response to each, in your view? I'm not going to change how I work but it would be interesting to see if you're shocked at me or not.","","","","2009-02-27","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

It's called Big Dog and it scares me. The way it moves is unsettling. It stumbles and then finds its feet. And the buzzing noise it emits makes it seem much more frightening. It is more frightening than things that Hollywood designs to be frightening. And yet, when someone gives it a violent kick - to demonstrate that it can right itself - I felt empathy, and momentary disgust toward the person kicking it. But it's just a motorised platform, and a very cool one at that. Conclusion: the future is going to be strange. Prepare yourselves.","<hr/>

I would just like to make the point that <a href=""http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2009/02/26/more-video-of-the-bi.html"">BoingBoing</a> posted something about Big Dog at 11: 07, whereas I called your attention to it at 10:49.

It's the IPG (did it again) conference this weekend, which I'm *so* looking forward to. The programme looks very good, but it's the catching up with people bit which I'm most excited about.

This weekend I was in Brighton at the IPG conference which was lovely - full of good stuff, good ideas and good people. My overall impression, though, was that everyone's head looked very large.

So Audrey Niffenegger's new book has <a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/news/79736-cape-confirms-niffenegger-deal.html"">received an advance of $5m</a>. Let's see how many copies it'll have to sell to make 1 profit.","First, the facts:

The $5m advance is the US advance only. In the UK, it'll be published by Cape who paid 'lots and lots'. Let's assume for the sake of argument that it's 3,617k - the same quantity at today's exchange rate. That sounds like 'lots and lots' to me. 

In the UK, the first edition will be a 17.99 hardback. Let's assume that it sells 25000 copies in hardback, and see how many paperbacks need to sell on top of that to break even. 

At 59% discount - the standard promotional rate on the High Street - each hardback copy will net 7.37. This is a rather optimistic figure, because the grocers will demand much more discount, but let's go with 59% for the moment. We're assuming the hardback will sell 25,000 copies which is 184k. 

However, that's just the net sales. Let's say the print costs per unit are 55p, the marketing costs are 15% and the distribution costs 22% of net. That's 13.7k,  27k and 40k respectively, taking the proceeds down to 102k. And remember, that's just the contribution to overheads. There are plenty of other costs like staffing, office, admin, legal, and all the other costs of running a business which aren't covered yet. Anyway, onto the paperback. 

The price will be 7.99, let's assume, and the discount again will be 59%. Once again, it's likely to be higher than this in the grocers, but let's be optimistic and hope that the average discount comes in around 60%. That gives 3.27 per unit net receipts. Using Excel's awesome Goal Seek tool, I calculate that the paperback would have to sell 2,050,732 copies to generate 3,514k (the value of the advance, remember, less the contribution from the hardback? Do keep up at the back) after distribution, marketing and print costs of 1.5m, 1m and 0.7m respectively (at the same percentages as given above but with a lower print cost):

Price: 7.99
Discount: 59%
Net per unit: 3.27
Vol forecast: 2,050,732
Net receipts: 6,717,994
Cost of print @ 0.35/ unit: 717,756
Cost of marketing @ 15% of net: 1,007,699
Cost of distribution @ 22%: 1,477,959
Contribution from hardback: 102,420
Amount left over (to pay off advance): 3,514,580

And don't even think about the cost of tying that money up for 18 months. Or the exposure if there are lots of returns. Or the additional cost of the extra stock - this model only costs the stock which sells. 

The Time Traveller's Wife has sold 1m copies, according to Nielsen. Do you reckon that this new book will sell over double that to contribute 1 to the overhead costs of the publisher?And Cape only have UK and Commonwealth rights so the scope for some supplemental rights deals is a bit low.

Here's a thing. The other day I wanted to check the meaning of a word and I happened to be nearer a dictionary than a computer. So I took the clumping great big dictionary off the shelf and opened it... to exactly the page with that word on. It's an 1800 page book and unlike other reference books that might fall open to the sections you use the most, I definitely don't keep looking up the same words. Mind you, the law of averages tells us that unlikely things will occasionally happen. But still, you do just wonder for a second whether you've now got a special power. So let me just see if I can do it again. Hmm, but maybe I can do it once out of three. OK, out of five then.","","","","","2009-03-17","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","7"

I must do a post on that (again) soon, the precis for which is: covers need to get a book past the retailer gatekeeper first and foremost, and then secondly need to send a quickly-decoded message to the shopper to tell them roughly what to expect. Whether the cover perfectly, exactly reflects the contents of the book is the third consideration on the list. 

Also: please don't query Snowbooks. Just follow the instructions on this website and send your script in. There are about 50 queries in my junk - I think they got there because they are all three or four pages long, using every trick in the book to try to get me to request the script.

Or: <strong>These Covers Aren't For You, Oh Reader Of This Blog</strong>

You may have noticed that Snowbooks keeps all its design in house. This is for the two very good reasons that it's one of the most fun and most important parts of the publishing process. We design our covers with very clear aims in mind - but interestingly, sometimes people think they're not right for the book. Let's take a look at this, shall we. 

(This blog post relates primarily to our fiction.)","Thing The First: our aim in life. 

Our primary business goal is to forge excellent relationships with retailers and to use their extensive brand presence, square footage and multiple locations to showcase, and sell, our books. The key part of that sentence is 'to sell our books'. That is what we aim to do. It shouldn't have to be said, really, but in actual fact quite a few smaller publishers don't have sales as one of their primary aims. They are interested in getting a particular sort of book into the public domain, sure, but from their actions it's hard to see how they can be particularly bothered about sales. Instead, they get a bit huffy when the sales team don't seem to be doing a good job. This happens because many publishers focus on the top end of publishing - the editorial end, the creation and signing up and words of a book - as they quite rightly should but not to the exclusion of all else. The subtle difference with our approach is that we start the publishing process with sales very firmly in mind. We'll only take on a book if we think we can sell it. Then, we can immerse ourselves in its creation - but again, with this process strongly informed by the sales plan. When it gets to the end of the creation process, then, it's all ready to be sold. The alternative approach I've seen is to be immersed in the creation of a book entirely, and when it's done to blink a few times and say 'Right. Over to the sales team.' That is not going to result in an easy book to sell. 

Thing The Second: How to get a book into a 3for2

And when I say we aim to sell books, I'm not talking about a few sales here and there. With every book I hope for 50,000 copies sold. Now that's hopelessly ambitious and never works (except once), but it's all that aiming for the moon and stars stuff. We hope to appeal to the mass market. There are two reasons for that. One, the mass market has masses of people in it, therefore we don't need much market share before we've got a winner. Two, our retailer partners aim to appeal to the mass market, too. It makes sense to be aiming for the same bunch of people. 

As I said above, our strategy is to work with retailers, to use their assets as the primary way to sell our books. We don't see much or any of a sales spike with reviews, or launches, or PR or any of the things that can take up vast amounts of time and money with no guarantee of translating into sales. We do, however, see flipping huge sales when we get a book onto promotion. Ergo, we try to get a lot of our books onto promotion. 

Now, what do retailers look for when they're thinking about which books to put onto promotion? They're looking for the sorts of books which sell in quantity. That space at the front of store is precious. It's not fair on them to expect them to take a chance on a book with no indication that it might do well. And most of our authors, we're proud to say, are debut authors. Wonderful though they are, we can rarely point to the success of their previous books to prove to the retailer that they will do well. So we have to rely on something else. 

That something else is the sum of the packaging. Endorsements matter: they are a good shorthand to say 'if you value the opinion of the person who's endorsing this book, you might enjoy it.' But it's the cover design itself which is the thing that people see first and foremost. 

Thing The Third: Covers are a filter

Bear in mind that of the 100,000-odd books published every year, a tiny fraction are promoted front of store. And then think about what a store looks like, in full promotional swing. There are still far too many books to choose from. Readers, shoppers, need to be given visual clues if they've a hope of navigating their way around that. Imagine if all the front of store books were bound in a plain white cover, with the author and title text in a black plain serif font. It would be a nightmare. You'd never find anything. The cover gives a critical clue about the type of book you're looking for. 

Thing The Final: What to do. 

But it gets more complicated. What if you have a book like The Letters which, whilst broadly women's lit, is very, very fine - finer, in fact, than its cousins on the shelves? Do you design a cover that reflects its literary ambition, a more sombre, reflective, original cover? Doing that will likely mean it sells 20 copies in total, as it won't be selected for promotion and therefore will die a quiet death. Or do you design a cover that places it slap bang in the women's lit category, knowing that those who select it for its women's lit elements won't be disappointed, but will have also stumbled upon a better-than-average read? 

Reader, we did the latter, of course. Whilst some bloggers have disagreed with the rightness of our cover, they are not our target market as there are too few of them. We are trying to catch the eye of, first, the retailer and second, the shopper. Looking at <a href=""http://www.snowsales.co.uk"">sales</a> so far, I think we've done a good job.

If you're interested in reading the rest of this post, it's probably because you already know what Dollhouse is, but just in case... It's the new TV series by Joss Whedon, the head writer and creator of Buffy, Angel and Firefly. As I write this, six episodes of Dollhouse have aired in the US and I've watched them all with great interest. And despite massive bias on my part in favour of everything Joss Whedon does, initially I've struggled to find much to praise. In fact so strong is my bias, that before I offered any verdict on Dollhouse I waited until a) I had someone other than Joss to blame for the things I didn't like and b) I had a reason to think the show was about to really start getting good. The rest of this post is only very mildly spoilery; if you know the basic premise of the show then I won't be giving too much away.","I watched the pilot, really didn't get that excited and reckoned, well, pilots are difficult. When that lack of excitement continued all the way through the second, third, fourth and fifth episodes, I was really starting to worry. The sixth episode was a huge improvement and I'm hoping it's a turning point in terms of quality.

What do Joss fans like me think is so great about his shows? Lots of things. He's very competent all round, but in terms of what sets him apart, I'll go with three things. His dialogue is fantastic: original, witty and intelligent. Dollhouse eps 1-5 really don't have any of that. Joss also creates surrogate families: tightly bonded groups of people who you love to care about. Dollhouse doesn't have that either. All the characters are either unlikeable or a total mystery - no charm, no instant favourites. And finally, Joss serves up surprises. Where the rest of network television likes formulas, Joss likes to innovate and catch you out. Well, nothing in the first five episodes seemed very original to me. It was glossy, competent and professional, but nothing you felt you hadn't seen before. If you've watched Alias, or even The Pretender, you're used to the idea of the hero playing a different role each week to accomplish their mission. Except in the case of Dollhouse, you knew the hero, played by Eliza Dushku, would forget the whole thing as soon as her brain was wiped ready for her next outing. And that seems to me to be the big flaw with the premise. The central character, Echo, has no memory and no personality besides what she is given for each mission. You can't really get to like her, because there's no her to like. Each week she's a stranger who you know will cease to exist before the end of the episode, so in a way it's like there's no central character. Or worse still, a central character who, in a sense, will die before the episode is done.

Now, Joss obviously foresaw some of the problems he'd encounter here. Even in the advanced publicity blurb for the series there were hints that the brain wipe might not be total, that the dolls in the Dollhouse might not lose <em>all</em> experience and personality. To quote a snippet from the Fox website: ""Echo acts with no memory of before. Or does she?"" And if she starts to grow or rediscover a personality, that will make it much easier for us to care about her. But until that process is well underway, there's a vacuum at the heart of any story that centres around a doll rather than a regular human.

So my first excuse on Joss's behalf - my first attempt to let him off the hook a little bit - comes from the fact that the network apparently pushed him towards showing a few actual missions before getting into the knotty questions of who was running the Dollhouse and what was really going on. It's easy to see why they pushed for that because things could get very complicated very quickly and viewers coming to the show late might find it impenetrable, but it was a terrible decision. For the reasons I've outlined, we just don't care about those missions, because the personality at the centre of them is a stranger who will soon cease to exist.

The second problem is Joss's fault, but more indirectly. And perhaps it's a matter of taste, but I just don't think Eliza Dushku's acting is as good as it needs to be. Attentive readers of this blog know that I believe weaker actors can only do confusion and anger (the first by furrowing their brow and the second by shouting) and while Eliza isn't bad, there's an awful lot of brow-furrowing. I just don't think she's quite strong enough to play the lead. The proof for me is that another doll, Sierra, does similar things and really grabs you. For me, Sierra is interesting and Echo is not and I can't think of an explanation apart from the actresses involved.

But I hope I'm not giving too much away when I say that in episode six we start getting into all that complex, tangled behind the scenes stuff. Echo's mission that week is almost incidental; the show is all about revelations and twists and intrigue, and that elevates the episode into the realm of proper Whedon-level quality. (I hope it's partly coincidence that I happened to really like the episode in which Eliza Dushku has the least screen time so far.)

And episode six is also the first time characters say witty, original things. Why that should be, I have no idea. I can't figure out how to blame it on the network. But for some reason, we've had five weeks of no humour despite the show's head honcho being one of the funniest writers on the planet.

We're still spending a lot of time with characters who are either irritatingly unlikeable or destined to be wiped soon, but things are really looking up. Tahmoh Penikett (who you may remember from Battlestar Galactica) is fantastic, and kicks ass (literally) to a superb standard. Joss has been giving interviews saying that episode six is where it gets good and claiming that they've hit their stride - he also hints that he's got the network off his back to the point where he can get on with the stuff he wanted to do all along. I hope he's right. But episode six (and my sycophantic devotion) makes me inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.

I don't think the show has a UK launch scheduled yet, but the DVDs are bound to be available in a month or two, and your favourite BitTorrent site will be able to hook you up immediately (assuming I'm allowed to say that). If you decide to watch, why not let me know what you think... assuming it's both positive and optimistic of course.","","","","2009-03-24","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

A year ago, I suppose this would have been one of my fringe political posts, but these days I seem to be well and truly in the majority with my 'unregulated capitalism is risky' outlook.

Anyway, imagine you go into work on Monday morning, drive your car through reception and into your firm's data centre. Then you take a hammer to the company's servers before setting light to the building. After that you get a cab to the bank, empty out the firm's account, cramming your pockets with as much cash as you can before putting the rest in sacks that you drop into the nearest canal. Finally, you use your company credit card to buy a Bentley which you spray paint with your firm's logo before driving slowly through town with the window down asking if anyone can spare some change. Oh, and imagine that you don't lose your job for doing all that. Matt Taibbi, of Rolling Stone, <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/26793903/the_big_takeover/print"">tells a tale</a> of the current financial crisis that reads much along those lines.

I've been sort of a vegetarian for about eighteen months now. There's probably a word for it ('piscetarian'?) because I still eat fish and seafood, but not what you might call critters, i.e. cows, chickens, etc. The two things that prompted me to go veggie, were 1) the hypocrisy argument and 2) land use. The hypocrisy argument is when you imagine the waiter in a restaurant bringing out the cow and asking whether you want it killed to provide your steak. I know I would have said 'no' if that had ever happened, but I still ate meat. (My brother, on the other hand, would have said 'yes' and been fine with his choice, so he's not a hypocritical meat-eater like I used to be.) But in the case of fish, I think I could do it. I don't feel that fish have feelings and intelligence the way tasty mammals do and if I was peckish enough, I think I could bump a fish off. 

The land use thing is about how growing food and then feeding it to animals, which you then eat, takes vastly more resources than just eating the crops yourself. We might not be able to control how many coal power stations there are in the world but if we all went veggie, you'd be able to see the difference from space. And while fish are farmed, and in the ocean they are fished almost to extinction, there isn't the same argument about the enormous wasting of land and resources.

Anyway, it's all been pretty easy. I never ate loads of meat so I don't miss it that much. Even things like steaks or hamburgers that I thought I'd miss, I don't. And I've never had that craving for bacon that plagues some would-be veggies. The only thing I really miss is pepperoni. Once a month or so, I'd like to be able to eat a pizza with pepperoni on it. So what do you think? Is there such a thing as a peppero-piscaterian? Is it fair enough to just be less of a food hypocrite but not to deal with it completely? What would you do?","","","","","2009-03-31","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","9"

//updated with extra words for, I hope, clarity//

You may recall that we co-founded <a href=""http://www.onixcentral.com"">Onix Central</a> at the start of this year with Robin Tobin. It's been going really well. Click 'continue reading' to read the note I've been sending to people. It's amazing how many of them say 'Really? I need to know how to do that. Yes please, tell me how I can use my ONIX data.' It's always been nice to work on books that require no selling because they speak for themselves; I'm finding a continuation of that with Onix Central. 

The reason for posting now, anyway, is to say that we have just launched a free tool which allows you to store all the fields required by the BIC product excellence scheme. I've explained a little more about what that means below the cut. <a href=""http://www.bic.org.uk/9/Accreditation/"">Here's</a> more information about their scheme, and <a href=""http://www.onixcentral.com/bic.html"">here</a> is our little offering. Did I mention it's free? <a href=""mailto:emma.barnes@onixcentral.com"">Email me</a> if you want it (PC or Mac, doesn't matter.)","Here's the note I've sent to people: 

""You can take ONIX bibliographic data  either from our own ONIX Central Title Store or your existing ONIX database  and use it as the source any time you display bibliographic data. That means your website, AIs, catalogues, order forms, retailer spreadsheets, your Amazon Advantage updates, your author sheets, title verso pages and your press releases, for example, are all populated  at the touch of a button or two  by ONIX. You can imagine the time, cost and frustration savings weve seen publishers enjoy. The catalogue alone has gone from being a three month job, no exaggeration, with constant re-setting and re-proofing, to a ten minute one from sitting down at my desk to pressing send on the email to the printer. 
 
Along with Robin Tobin, the founder of Anko Publishing Software, and Rob Jones, the chairman of Snowbooks, Ive founded ONIX Central to help publishers to put their ONIX to work. If youd like us to explain more do let me know, or visit our <a href=""http://www.onixcentral.com"">website</a> where there are things like free code, examples of our work, tutorial videos, screenshots and commentary on all things ONIX. 
 
If you are not yet ONIX compliant, we can help with that too. We offer the ONIX Central Title Store, ONIX consultancy, training, databases and assistance with the migration and cleaning of your data - again, there are more details on the website. The ONIX Central Title Store is packed to the rafters with tools to save time. For instance, at the touch of a button you can upload your covers to Nielsen, Amazon and whichever other supply chain partners you like, via FTP. You can generate excel spreadsheets in exactly the right format for the buyers at Waterstone's, Borders, Gardners, and Amazon. You can export an ONIX message both to send to Nielsen and also to populate your website, catalogue, AIs and other marketing materials. You can contain all your title information in one place, including pdfs, jpgs and other files, so you don't have to search around for the scan of that really good review from six months ago. And the interface is clean and crisp because, let's face it, data entry is boring - so you may as well be looking at a beautiful, easy to use interface. Try not to think about the dull data entry and think instead that you'll only have to do it once - not once to Nielsen, again to each retailer, again in you catalogues, again in your AIs, again to Amazon Advantage and so on.""


Explanation of ""a free tool which allows you to store all the fields required by the BIC product excellence scheme.""

The tool I'm talking about is a database. Like all databases it has fields, which we've set up to store specific information about books. The book industry has come together to agree what the most important book-related information is. It includes things like the title of a book, the author, the ISBN number and so on. Sharing this sort of data in a standardised format helps the data to flow around the industry, from publisher to distributor to wholesaler to retailer. 

Our database contains fields which, when filled in by the publisher, provide a record of all the most important data as agreed by BIC - the people who are responsible for ensuring the book trade is as efficient as possible. We're offering this database for free. You don't need any special software, just a computer (Mac or PC) and your fingers to fill in the fields. The database comes as standard in our more complete database product, the Onix Central Title Store, which allows publisher to contain and organise a lot more data, and export it into an ONIX message. For more about ONIX, click on the link on the left, there, under everything else, marked Reference Documents. The Onix Central Title store costs 315 which is blooming good value.

But before I do I must tell you about Microsoft Accounting Pro. Call me crazy but I'm so excited to have discovered it. I have used Sage and Quickbooks and despise them both for their obfuscation and lack of beauty. But MS's Accounting software is just about perfect. My god, I even did a few journals in it today without screwing them up. I set up four currencies, just like that, and amended a template so it looks just as I wanted it - easily, in MS Word! It has an excellent help file. I can import all my contacts from Outlook, should I want to. And I think I've barely scratched the surface. 

I heartily recommend that you check it out. There's a <a href=""http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/accounting/default.aspx"">free trial </a>should you want a tinker.

I sometimes get confused: what are we here to talk about? Joss Whedon? Or was it indie publishing? Well, until I can get clear on that, I'd better make sure you're kept up to date with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon"">Joss</a>-related news. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollhouse_(TV_series)"">Dollhouse </a>will air in the UK on the (what now?)

Oh bums. I recently wrote about how I don't eat meat but I do eat fishes. Partly that was for reasons of empathy (I don't really empathise with fish) and partly environmental. So I was bit disappointed to read an article in New Scientist about how the remaining stocks of edible fish in the oceans are plummeting. We've eaten nearly all of them. So we're shifting to littler fish and hence thinning them out too. My first thought was that this would leave the oceans half empty, but apparently it's more complicated than that. Fish eat jellyfish and squid. Without the fish, their slimy prey go into overdrive. And we're still going to need to eat, so... <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126981.900-jellyfish-sushi-seafoods-slimy-future.html"">The New Scientist article</a> does a lovely job of guiding one through the process of eating jellyfish instead of cod or squid instead of tuna.

Ooh, here's a thing I'm going to regret saying. It seems to me that all countries do bad things, but when Israel does them, criticising them is denounced as anti-semitic. Well, I don't care who bombs civilians, I'm not in favour of it. I don't like it when Britain does it and I don't like it when Israel does it. If we'd taken Israel's approach to security, when the IRA let off a bomb in a London pub, we'd have flown a couple of helicopter gunships into Belfast and fired some missiles at a few blocks of flat we thought militant republicans might live in as a way of persuading the community to police their own. Fortunately, this sort of behaviour occasionally gets criticised by people who it's hard to accuse of anti-semiticism, i.e. Israelis.

Part of me is a little hesitant about directing so many professional i-dotters and t-crossers towards the words of a self-confessed bad speller, but bear in mind that Verity undoubtedly knows a lot more about critters than you do, and that she's grabbing a hasty few minutes on the communal computer at the end of each busy day. She's hoping to figure out a way to get some of her photos and drawings up soon, which I'm looking forward to, but the island's low-speed internet connection is currently holding that up. I hope I won't be the only person who will get a kick out of comparing my day to one that involves counting butterflies, collecting driftwood, copying down the day's weather report and checking to see how many eggs the hens have laid.","","","","","2009-04-14","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Rob's on holiday. I haven't spoken to him since Doctor Who special at the weekend, but I can't leave the Snowblog without a review of it for much longer. He'll do a proper one on his return. 

<u>My review. </u>
It was pants. Well, at the least, it was like a pantomine. ""What the blazes is going on,"" exclaims our over-wrought heroine. Poor David Tennant, doing the very best he can with a script which was astonishing in its lack of ambition. 
Anyway, Rob can tear it to shreds more eloquently upon his return. 

Update, a second after posting. 
Oh, there's Rob, posting below! Hi! Hi old pal!","<hr/>

<u>Rob's Review</u>
Dear Em, I have had a cold and haven't been doing any telephoning but I am feeling better now, thanks. As you know, Anna came over to England to watch the Doctor Who Easter Special <span style=""font-size: 80%;"">(and to attend the London Book Fair)</span> so we watched it together. And somehow... we didn't hate it.

Now I'll admit that Planet of the Dead wasn't well written or anything. In fact I was genuinely shocked at how the first ten minutes was entirely bolted together from flat-packed clich&eacute;s. How could anyone write a scene with a 'jewel thief' dressed in stretchy black coming down on a rope from a museum roof to snatch something valuable from inside a cage of glowing lines? That's beyond clich&eacute;. It's too tired an idea even to spoof. I'm sure I've seen it in shampoo commercials and kids shows. But then I suppose you could make an argument that the clich&eacute; is the setup to a little joke, where you're expecting a helicopter to lift the thief off the roof (not that the BBC can afford a helicopter) and instead she's forced to get on a bus. Less obvious is how you excuse the Tomb Raider ripoff. If you're going to have a beautiful, athletic young woman who steals ancient artefacts, should you really make her an English noblewoman, just like Lara Croft? At least she wasn't wearing shorts and carrying a couple of pistols.

But once that was out of the way, the only clich&eacute;s Russell T Davies seemed to be recycling were his own. A stranded bus in the middle of a hostile desert. The idea that all dangerous settings, especially spaceships, have vertical wells you have to climb up or down. The principle that many alien races are simply intelligent versions of familiar Earth creatures.

What did I like? I liked the swarm of rays. I liked the idea that they circle the planet in unison to open a gateway to their next world. I quite liked Michelle Ryan's attempts to wrestle fun and drama out of the silly things she was supposed to say (David Tennant always manages it. Somehow.). I liked Lady Christina soaring off into the sky in a flying bus - and the implicit idea that if she ever returns, she might swoop in, driving the self-same vehicle.

As Anna pointed out, maybe RTD's determination to consistently underwhelm has finally pushed my expectations low enough that I can properly enjoy those occasions when he doesn't drench an episode in misery and confusion. I can't see 'specials' like this one properly thrilling anyone, but I preferred it to every episode of last season (barring the Steven Moffat Library two-parter of course).","","","","2009-04-14","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"
"42186","","1","A lovely review","Publish","true","<div class=""pic""><img alt=""MagnifyBook.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/MagnifyBook.jpg"" width=""150"" height=""200"" /></div>

Here's a lovely review from Amazon of our current book of the website, Paris Immortal Absolutions.","Eagerly awaiting book 4, 13 April 2009 By  paranormal noakes (UK) - See all my reviews
 
This review is from: Paris Immortal: Absolutions (Paperback) 
Absolutions is the 3rd book in the ever attractive Paris Immortal series. To be honest I'm shocked to find a bad review even exists about it - I suppose the stories are not everyone's cup of tea (or glass or blood) but I can unequivocally say that Sherry Roit has made this the finest parnomal romance/horror/drama that I have ever read. 
 
Her first-person POV writing style is engaging, and gives a lot of insight into the character and personality of whomever is thinking at the time. I find that it endears you to the characters (almost all of which you can genuinely feel for - with the notable exception of P.K, who's character has not yet been delved into in depth) very quickly. 
 
This is obviously just my own opinion, but I very find it very easy to emote with the characters of Paris Immortal - particularly Trey - and I can honestly say that this book had me in tears: Not once but at least 5 times! I found it impossible not to get swept up in Trey's viewpoint in certain of the scenes, as his terror, loss, and even shock come across so beautifully with the writing style. 
 
The little details that the characters notice help to give you a mental picture of almost every scene, bringing you closer to the the author's impression of what's going on - something that I find is missing from a lot of novels. The majority of the time with a book, your visual idea of the characters or surroundings turns out to be vastly different from someone elses, and the full moment that the author was trying to capture is lost. Hopefully that is not the case here. 
 
For those that crave non-stop action and heat this is probably not your kind of series. There are indeed moments of pure violent or sexual tension, but the rollercoaster here is purely emotional. The focus is squarely on the characters themselves and their struggles to cope with the horrors in their own past. If, like me, you enjoy a book that gets you under the skin of the people involved, and leaves you not waiting for the nice explosion but rather rooting for the characters to survive the tortures within their own minds, then this is the book for you. Don't fret though horror-hounds: People still get eviserated. *winks* 
 
The sexual tension runs tantilisingly high through Paris Immortal and Paris Immortal Awakenings, but in Absolutions finally emerges into a couple of very nicely handled sex scenes that you find you've been almost as desperate to see realised as the characters involved! I can't fault the writing there either - It likely won't appeal to those who prefer the intimate detail of other fine authors such as J.R Ward, but the subtlety in itself keeps the moments tender and allies this firmly with the 'romance' part of 'paranormal romance.' For someone that has read and enjoyed a lot of arguably 'hotter' books, this approach was a welcome change. After the initial sexual output in this 3rd book you will find that the sexual tension all but vanishes, but you are left with a more than adequate impression of the love felt by the parties involved throughout the rest of the book: Again, something that can too often be sacrificed by other authors so they can fit in a couple more bestselling sizzling chapters. 
 
If you're potentially baulking at reading these books for fear of reading something that you'd consider TMI in the way of homosexual passion: don't. Read the books. Even if you're one of those people who finds homoeroticism a little twitchy in book, I doubt that you'll be offended. Hopefully you'll simply be left touched by the aforementioned love between the main characters. On the other hand, if homoeroticism in your book choice really isn't something that you feel comfortable with, avoid Paris Immortal like the plague as virtually all of the characters are either gay or bi. 
 
Last but certainly not least, the desciptions of Paris itself are superb. With every book and every chapter the author takes you on a tour of the sights and streets, and you are left marvelling at the wonders, beauty, and history of this most famous of cities. If it does wonders for Parisian tourism, I wouldn't be surprised. 
 
Overall, I thoroughly recommend this series to anyone who's looking to try something new in the way of paranormal romance. Any book that by turns makes me cry (and feel genuine heartache for a fictional character), laugh out loud, grin, and sit rivetted to my seat turning pages to find out what happens, I certainly consider worth the read. 
 
Not to mention a gloriously unassuming and elegant cover design, that will sit with pride on any shelf. 
 
I hope you enjoy them as much as I.","","","","2009-04-14","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

Just got a mailshot email from Business Link. 'Urgent support for failing businesses', it says. I am mildly interested. I mean, if they're sending out bags of money, might be worth reading on. So I do. It reads: 

""We have recently launched a new Rapid Response service to provide urgent help to established businesses struggling through the recession."" Oh good. Nice to see. What is the nature of this urgent help, I wonder? 

Their idea of help, as I read on, is to provide help with dissolving your business. Oh. Oh that's just what a struggling business is most in need of. Well done The Government for being not only useless, but mildly offensive to boot. 

There are, in their defence, other sevices that they offer, like advice. Here's a fantastically useful piece: 
""One thing that is critical is to be on top of your financial performance and costs, managing cash flow and having proper systems to monitor these - dont take your eyes off that."" I'm sorry to be rude, but - no shit? Honestly, it infuriates me that people think they're helping - and get paid for 'helping' - but in fact parrot the blindingly obvious. Take the advisor's salaries and gift it to companies in the form of short term interest free working capital loans - that would be of immeasurably more use.","","","","","2009-04-16","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

MEP. The post has arrived, bringing, just in time, my lovely <a href=""http://issuu.com/snowbooks/docs/marketing"">AI books</a> for the book fair. And some bugger at the Post Office has managed to bash the parcel so effectively that all three copies have a huge fold down the middle. 

I am really upset. (I mean, I am upset as far as one can be upset by a ruined book.) I was looking forward to having these gorgeous articles to show off our lovely books, and now they have a big fold down the middle. I have them currently in the nipping press, trying to de-crease them. Later, I will get the iron out. 

This is Lulu's fault. Poor packaging. I was getting on so well with them until now. FAIL.","","","","","2009-04-16","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Johnston.html"">Leila</a> has mentioned a certain book to me a couple of times, and as you longtime readers know, I'm interested in how brainy crows are, so why wouldn't I want to read the true story of a lady who ends up raising a rook and a magpie? Turns out there are no reasons. So if you like the same things I do, pick yourself up a copy of <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Corvus-Life-Birds-Esther-Woolfson/dp/1847080898/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1239957926&sr=8-3"">Corvus</a> by Esther Woolfson. Esther writes in an almost pedantically eloquent style that on its own wouldn't tell you whether the book came out last year or in the 1890s. Initially I thought her refusal to be hurried through a sentence might annoy me (as you know, I have a hair-trigger prose allergy that can easily flare up) but very quickly it becomes relaxing. Unlike much catchy, cool, enthusiastic writing, this won't give you a headache. You start to feel like you're in a vintage rowing boat, gliding downstream, reaching out to brush the hanging blossom while someone tells you about the peculiarities of their life and the wonders of the natural world as they pertain to the mysteries of crows. And that makes for a good book.","","","","","2009-04-17","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

So, Day One of the London Book Fair is over. All I had to do was stand up and occasionally hold a conversation and yet it seemed strangely exhausting. It's probably the contrast with my usual day of sitting down and occasionally pushing a button. Lots of interesting people have come by our tiny stand (which is in the IPG section of the floor). We've also had visits from a couple of our authors (I'm not contrasting that with 'interesting people', merely getting specific). <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Brackston.html"">Paula Brackston</a> (pictured with Anna) has even gone to the extent of offering to fetch coffee when we needed it. We also had a  chat to the people of <a href=""http://completelynovel.com/"">CompletelyNovel</a> about what it is they do. I think I'm going to find out more but you can go and explore their site for yourself right now. There are books to read for free online - or you can buy a printed copy. You can likewise find an online home for your writing and have help self-publishing it and selling it through the site. And there's a community aspect with reviews and discussions and virtual book clubs and blogs. Plus, what imaginative new venture would be complete without a collection of three-minute video book <a href=""http://blog.completelynovel.com/the-book-stop"">reviews</a> complete with 'helpful' advice (I use those quotes advisedly)? I think the video book reviews are really a Machiavellian ploy to make Anna Lewis and her accomplices there seem likable. And it's working.","","","","","2009-04-21","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Picking up the mantle where Rob left off, I report on LBF day 2. Another good but roundly knackering day. We met the new owner of our printer Haynes, now JF Print, and were thoroughly impressed with the steps the company is taking to become ever stronger. I think a trip down to Yeovil will come in the not too distant future. Rob and I saw an old chum from our Superdrug days - it's getting on for 15 years since we'd last seen each other which is slightly horrifying. We had some rights interest from some pretty cool publishers. And on the <a href=""http://www.onixcentral.com"">Onix Central </a>side of things, Robin had about a million meetings, all highly positive. 

And me? Rowan and I went together, so I arrived late and left early. But it was long enough to see some old friends, to make some new ones and to get that sense of invigoration, of new plans and opportunities, that comes from chatting and swapping notes at the Fair. 

And now, flicking through the papers whilst winding down for a good night's sleep in preparation for the third and final day, I read <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5191040/Astronomers-find-Milky-Way-could-taste-of-raspberries.html"">this:</a>

I haven't posted about climate change for a while. The last time I did, nearly all of the many comments were about how we don't need to do anything. That seemed strange to me given the level of scientific consensus to the contrary. And what was also interesting was that everyone had a different reason for why no action was required. And recently I've been reading about even more reasons to do nothing. If you have a favourite do-nothing justification that's not on this list, maybe you'd post a comment.","No action required because:
1. The climate is not really changing. 
2. The climate is changing, but it's 'natural' not man-made. It's out of our hands.
3. Man-made climate change is real, but not serious
4. Man-made climate change is real and serious but too expensive to tackle right now
5. Man-made climate change is real and serious, but science will come up with a painless fix soon.
6. Man-made climate change is real, serious and we're all doomed. Why fight it?","","","","2009-04-28","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","10"

Here's the sort of thing I like to hear U.S. presidents say: 
<span style=""font-family: courier;"">""I was struck by an article that I was reading the other day talking about the fact that the British, during World War Two, when London was being bombed to smithereens, had 200 or so detainees. And Churchill said 'we don't torture', when all of the British people were being subjected to unimaginable risk and threat. And the reason was that Churchill understood you start taking shortcuts, and over time, that corrodes what's best in a people. It corrodes the character of a country.""</span>

No one likes to think of themselves as a mutant or outside the parameters of normal human anatomy, but that's the conclusion I've reached. I got the Bluetooth headset (pictured) a few months ago because it got such fantastic reviews, and was supposed to fit really well. But I tried and tried and couldn't get it to sit comfortably. It was either painful (and then would fall off) or dangling (and then would fall off). And since then, every few weeks I think 'but it <em>must </em>fit. I'll try again.' Whatever you can think of, I've tried and it won't fit. And then today I flipped over the hook and tried it on my left ear and it clipped on nicely. So now I know. I'm an asymmetrical mutant.","","","","","2009-05-01","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

It's nice to know that even when things are pretty grim, it's still possible to laugh. It's a very sad time for my family at the moment because my little brother passed away at the weekend. But despite lots of grieving people around, my mum's cat wasn't deterred in his attempts to find an unguarded glass of water to drink from. He has a bowl of fresh water of his own, but a drinking glass on a table, even if it only has a few sips in it, right at the bottom, is irresistible. We were in the middle of some sad reminiscence when we noticed he'd jammed his head so far into the glass he'd had to fold his ears right back on his head. And when he lifted his head, the glass came with him. Sorry the photo is so blurry; I was laughing when I took it. (click on the thumbnail to see a bigger version.)","<hr/>

Those of you who read my pal <a href=""http://atraineewarden.blogspot.com/"">Verity's blog</a> will know that a couple of times there have been no takers for the afternoon trip over to the island she's living and volunteering on.

Good morning, world. Hope you had a nice weekend. We went to Wales and it was exceedingly pleasant, except for the long journey, which Ro was quite firmly against. Ah well, all back in one piece which is the main thing. 

I don't really care about the following, so it's a very half-hearted rant. But still.","Just got a letter from Barclays. We maintain an account with them but don't use it, but who knows when you'll need a line of credit, and this account has an overdraft attached. They have made improvements based on customer feedback, it says here. I read on. The improvements are four in number. 

- A 16 digit account code. Erm, not sure that anyone would have asked for that but never mind. 
- Something else of no consequence
- Something else of no consequence (the letter's in the bin now, I can't remember 2 and 3, and I'm not fishing it out again)
- They're raising the cost of reproduced statements from 2 to 3. 

I would love to see the tapes of the customer feedback interviews where a punter says 'you know what? I'm really worried that Barclays aren't shafting me sufficiently.

Bad Lulu. They have miscommunicated in the worst way to their customers - by making it look like their books have been singled out for special treatment when the opposite is true.","I got this email this morning: 

<em>""Dear Lulu Author, 
Congratulations, your book has been selected for listing on Amazon.com's Marketplace!  As a result, your book will now be easily found on the world's largest online bookseller.
There will be some differences between your listing on Lulu and your listing on Amazon.  Amazon charges a fee to list your book, and in order to cover that cost your book will be listed with a 30% markup; however your royalty will remain the same, and your book's price on Lulu will not change.  Furthermore, your book sales on Amazon will reflect in your Lulu account immediately. 

Lulu is committed to helping you increase your book's sales and we hope you enjoy the benefits of listing your book on Amazon.com. 
Kind regards, 

Lulu""</em>

Then throughout the day I have received now fewer than five emails from excited authors who write to tell me that their self published book, which they have currently got on submission to us, has been selected by Amazon. 

Sadly, this is a generic email. Nothing's been 'selected'. And Lulu should realise that they're messing with people's heads if they pretend otherwise. If I can find the time I'm going to switch providers as a result of this. Decentness Fail.","","","","2009-05-27","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","7"

I was all ready to post a slightly sarky post about a new device I bought last week, but I thought I'd try it out first to give you a rounded review. It is, ladies and gentlemen, a steam mop. I was going to talk wryly about how I was taking my dedication to steampunk a bit too far, har har, but then I switched it on. And mopped. 

And I am telling you the truth when I say that my heart skipped a beat and I realised, then, that life would never be the same. In as long as it takes to do a not very thorough hoover, my floors are steamed to a sterile gleam. Plus it sounds a bit like the Enterprise powering up. Also: steam! Great billowing clouds of the stuff. 

I heartily recommend that you acquire such a <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000TVXEHG/ref=s9_k2a_gw_ir03?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=19MJ338VYCQN5533F0YA&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=467198433&pf_rd_i=468294"">device</a>, as soon as you can. Life enhancing, truly.

Click below the line or <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Onix%20admin.pdf"">download</a> a job spec for Onix Administrators. This is a superb opportunity for someone looking for their first break in publishing - probably a recent graduate. It's a 6 month contract - this isn't a job for life, but instead will get you a CV to die for. You'll be working for me, so you'll also be able to learn about how Snowbooks works. And judging by the many applications I get for unpaid work experience, I'm sure that the prospect of a paid job where you learn this stuff is rather fine. 

You will have to be very comfortable with computers. I'm not necessarily expecting you to be able to process XSLT using Eclipse on the first day, although that would be great,  but I need you to be fascinated by what I'm talking about and keen to learn. In fact, you should be googling it right now. (And heads up: if you come to interview, guess what I'm going to ask?) Ideally, you don't just use Amazon: you dig around in their API. You don't just Twitter: you write little Twitter apps. You blog, but you've installed it yourself and tweaked the CSS to your tastes.

Like they say in arguments about book copyright, piracy is not an author's greatest threat, obscurity is. And in industries like music, books and movies, the threat of obscurity is made worse because big names get the marketing spend to make them even bigger and everyone else tends to gets nothing. Focussing demand where you want it might make business sense, but I prefer the idea that we can each find authors who suit us, regardless of whether they're big names. To my way of thinking, we need to gradually replace the existing marketing machinery with something a bit more like a dating agency, which helps match author to reader. 

I don't know exactly what such a thing would look like, but <a href=""http://www.completelynovel.com/"">CompletelyNovel</a> seems like it might be a step in the right direction. If you're an author, it's pretty quick and easy to sign up. Here's a <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Starting%20an%20author%20profile%20on%20CompletelyNovel.pdf"">PDF</a> on how to do it. I'll admit, I'm biased in favour of CompletelyNovel compared with other, more corporate projects, partly because of their indy feistiness and partly because they're such nice people.

You know me. Time poor and money poor. Not the best combination. So believe me when I say: when I want to set up a website, I do it quickly and cheaply. It breaks my heart to hear people I care about (or even people I don't even know, like a dairy farmer I heard on Radio 4 the other day) saying that they spent 2000 on their website. So I've written out how to do it for free, or almost free. Go to <a href=""http://www.website4free.org "">www.website4free.org </a>to see how to set up a Wordpress based website. I'll be adding a way to set up a website for completely free except for the price of the domain name (about a fiver) in the next week or so. 

You can thank me by buying a book or two.","","","","","2009-07-11","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

Sorry I haven't been around much lately. I've been taking a long holiday after all the difficulties of the last year or so. I'm back in the UK now, though, and what should catch my eye but a new season of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchwood"">Torchwood</a>. 

Maybe you remember how critical I've been of that particular franchise in the past. I may even have blamed it for some of the worst television I've seen in my whole life. Which you might think would make me avoid it, but I don't. There are two reasons for this. One is the only sign of possible patriotism I've yet detected within myself. If the UK is exporting television to the world, I'd rather it wasn't howlingly wretched. Or maybe I just want Britain to have a thriving TV industry so that one day there'll be room for me in it. And the other reason is somewhat similar: if I ever end up selling a script to a TV production company, the chances are that shows like Torchwood will be my competition. And if that competition is puerile drivel, that's worth knowing. So with my fish-rifle in hand, I pulled up another barrel of Torchwood and prepared to open fire. 

I knew they'd made changes, I'd heard there was a new direction but nothing could have prepared me for the sensation I experienced while watching ep1 of season 3: the feeling of mild enjoyment. Even excitement in places. And amusement. (And only the very infrequent twinge of major irritation.) Is it possible they've changed Torchwood so much that it's actually... good?","Maybe you remember what my biggest complaint was with Torchwood season one? The team were supposed to keep Earth safe and all they did was imperil it, while whining and bickering. Earth would be markedly safer if the Torchwood team were disarmed and locked in a Big Brother house somewhere, squabbling among themselves. 

Season two saw the team occasionally tackle problems instead of just causing them. They still moped and whinged constantly - and don't forget the bickering. And they were still the least impressive front-line against alien malevolence you could imagine. But despite shooting themselves in the foot at every opportunity they sort of almost sometimes saved the day. Nearly.

But something strange has happened now that season three is here. A crisis has presented itself and what remains of the team are attempting to resolve it in a professional and even insightful manner. And then, when the chips are down and disaster strikes, they are somehow keeping it together and making intelligent, capable efforts towards remedying the situation. They still have emotions and weaknesses, but somehow these things no longer prevent them from doing their jobs - even excelling at them. Curious. 

I know this is going to be hard to believe, but I really didn't want episode two to end. I wanted more. More! - not less.

It's still not what you might call 'superb'. But neither is it a blot on the TV schedules and a waste of licence-payers' money. And what's more, I'm enjoying it.

It can't last, of course. Soon, the team will decide that expressing their inner anguish takes precedence over the survival of the human race. Or they'll get into a big argument and start shooting each other (as they are so wont to do). But just for now, I'm really enjoying this little oasis of acceptable quality television - and tentatively hoping it might last a week or two longer.

(Remember, you can watch BBC programmes that you've missed using iPlayer. And you can even download programmes to watch offline if you use a bit of software like <a href=""http://linuxcentre.net/getiplayer/"">get_iplayer</a>. It's not the friendliest thing to use, but if you wanted to grab a quicktime copy of s3ep2 of Torchwood, you'd type:
<span style=""font-family: courier; color: blue;"">get_iplayer Torchwood</span>
then you'd note that the show you wanted was numbered 697 so you'd type:
<span style=""font-family: courier; color: blue;"">get_iplayer --get 697</span>
and the file will start downloading.)","","","","2009-07-25","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

There's going to be an enquiry into unpaid internships, says the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/jul/31/mps-graduate-interns-pay"">Guardian.</a> It would be interesting to see what would happen if internships were banned in publishing. I bet you anything companies would suddenly pay a lot more attention to ways to automate processes and <a href=""http://www.onixcentral.com"">organise their data,</a> for a start, if there wasn't a free labourer to do all the mindlessly repetitive tasks.

Mind you, it's a bit catch 22. So many people are willing to work for free that it immediately reduces the chances of people who can't or won't when they go head to head for a job. 

My personal view, after having a lot of intern types in the early days of Snowbooks, is that they tend to require more time and energy than they put back into the business. And they all want to be editors. And when quizzed, they're not sure why. 'Er, because I love reading?' Get a library card, then, I have been known to mutter in my more snarly moments. The truth of the matter, of course, is that there's a lot more to being an editor than reading but it's very hard to understand that until you've experienced office working for a while. But being an intern won't really expose you to office politics, power struggles and inter-company bitching - not unless you pay very close attention and lurk behind close doors. My advice: work in another field for a few years, a lucrative one, then start your own company. It's the only way you can get to do what you want all day without someone else telling you to do something else.","","","","","2009-08-01","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

Hello, it's Seldom Heard From Anna here.  I wanted to make a public announcement that all submissions from before August 2009 have been replied to.  If you submitted a manuscript to us before August and haven't had a reply, either it never made it to my inbox, or the rejection letter (sorry) didn't get to you.  

If this is the case A) double check your junk mail folder, in case my reply got directed there and B) please don't send a questioning e-mail (I delete all manuscripts that are rejected, so I'll have no record); just resubmit.

I do want to congratulate you all on some great writing -- it might be just in my head, but it seems like the quality of the submissions on the whole just gets better and better every year.  So do believe me when I say that a rejection from Snowbooks shouldn't stop anybody from pushing on, trying to find a different home for his or her work.  There's a place for every written word; traditional publishing might not be the answer for everybody, and Snowbooks certainly isn't right for most books, but keep looking for your perfect audience.

My apologies to anybody who received multiple replies (due to sending multiple submissions).  Although I take my time in considering each manuscript, I send out the replies very quickly once the reading is done, so I occasionally fail to notice I've already replied to an author in a previous e-mail.  And while I'm apologizing, I should say that I know everybody is hungry for feedback on their work, but I genuinely do not have the time.  More often than not, however, rejections are a case of a particular genre not being of interest to us at the moment or a failure to 'click' -- so my feedback wouldn't be particularly useful, anyway.  Thanks for your understanding!","","","","","2009-08-17","2013-03-29","","","","Anna","1"

Oh yes, here is the sun and here is the outside and oh my, here is another room other than my study where I can spend some time now that last week is over. I have been typesetting Sexton Blake, all 768 pages of it.","It started out life as a selection of hundreds of PDF scans done by editor George Mann and wonderful Sexton Blake fan <a href=""http://www.sextonblake.co.uk"">Mark Hodder</a> like this: 

<img alt=""orig.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/orig.jpg"" width=""468"" height=""706"" />

Guess how we got them into indesign. Go on, guess. Yep, we typed them out. And when I say we, of course I mean not me. We attempted <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition"">OCRing </a>first but the quality of the originals was just too low, so, deadlines looming, we made a new plan. 

Firstly Mark Hodder did an astonishing amount in a handful of weeks. Then, his fingers bloody stumps, he went on holiday so my amazing sister in law (who also cut my hair, multitalented lass that she is) took over. Then time was running out so I used <a href=""http://www.elance.com"">Elance</a>, which was ok except the first provider bit off more than she could chew and the second sneakily OCRed much of it, meaning I had to spend all week editing out nonsense. I think it would have been marginally quicker to type it myself, in hindsight. 

It has been a major task and I'm pleased with the result. Can't wait to show you <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9781906727413.html"">the finished piece </a>as the stories really are amazing.

Eight have been discovered, and many smaller villages, but there are doubtless more. The biggest, Derinkuyu, wasn't discovered until 1965, when a resident cleaning the back wall of his cave house broke through a wall and discovered behind it a room that he'd never seen, which led to still another, and another. Eventually spelunking archeologists found a maze of connecting chambers that descended at least 18 stories and 290 feet beneath the surface, ample enough to hold 30,000 people - and much remains to be excavated.""</span>

That's not fiction. It's real. It's one of the bits I like best from Alan Weisman's book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/World-without-Us-Alan-Weisman/dp/0753513579/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251279484&sr=1-1"">The World Without Us</a>, which I've mentioned <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/09/better_off.html"">before</a>. But I'm mentioning it again because that passage gets quoted in Geoff Manaugh's <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bldgblog-Book-Architectural-Conjecture-Speculation/dp/0811866440/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251279450&sr=8-1"">The BLDGBLOG Book</a> (from the <a href=""http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/"">website </a>of the same name). And Geoff can keep up that level of spellbinding revelation for chapters at a time. In this book his departure points for architectural flights of fancy include Redesigning the Sky and what Geoff calls Landscape Futures. And all of it is wonderfully stimulating for the imaginative juices. In fact if I have a complaint about the BLDGBLOG book, it's that every ten minutes I totally tune out because it's given me a great idea for a novel. And then another one. And another. If you read it for no other reason, it's a great way of devising the plots for seventy or so Hollywood blockbusters and a couple of hundred eery novels. Or you could just read it because it's the most tangential, daydream-inducing treasure chest of ideas. Recommended.","","","","","2009-08-26","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I will now share with you a sure-fire moneymaking scheme. It is unrelated to publishing. But, if you've lost your job in publishing and now you're destitute, for a small up-front investment, you can now earn good money.

In the olden days, peddlers would go door-to-door sharpening knives. These days that's less useful. Curiously men, especially bachelors, would rather sharpen their own knives. But men, especially bachelors, require help in another area: pocket change. What to do with it? Do you carry round a bulging pocketful of small coins and then, when asked for a medium-sized sum announce, 'I think I've got the right change!' and start counting out coppers? Or do you hand over a crisp note and just dump any coins you accumulate at home. The answer is the latter.

So here's the moneymaking scheme:","A knock at the door and a friendly, destitute-ex-publisher asks, 'Got any loose change you want to swap for notes? Five percent commission?'. You jump at the chance. Rooting around the house you come up with piles of coins everywhere. You've even transferred a load to various containers and plastic bags and stuck them in the bottom of your wardrobe. You asked about taking them to the bank, but the bank needed you to count them into bags first. Boring. So you fill an old tin bath with 2p coins and take them out to the peddler, who has a coin-sorter mounted on the front of an old, black, iron tricycle. Putting the bike on its stand, the Peddler pedals away furiously to provide electricity for the coin-sorter. The total: 68.72. The peddler takes a cut of just under four pounds and counts out over sixty quid in nice, neat tens in to your hand. Lovely.","","","","2009-08-30","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

When I get a minute, I'll have to figure out what exactly Facebook rifles through in order to make its suggestions for new friends. But it seems to presuppose that anyone you're in contact with is someone you're getting on wonderfully with. A little while ago someone I hired someone I didn't know to help out with a few bits and pieces and they got into financial trouble. They kept the cash I sent them for paying bills with and I had to hire someone else to take over. I haven't yet seen any of that money back yet. Fortunately the loss of that cash isn't causing me problems, but it wasn't a great situation. Nevertheless, once a week Facebook suggests that I befriend that person. Slow down, Facebook. They did sort of, kind of, a little bit rob me. Couldn't you find me someone else instead?","","","","","2009-08-31","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Stephen Fry writing about writing, referencing Clive James, quoting Thomas Mann saying this: <span style=""font-family: courier;"">""A writer is a person for whom writing is more difficult than for other people."" </span> Which I sort of take to mean that a writer is both more acutely aware of words and more strict with them; it's only those who are neither who can scribble away without effort.

Things I would advise do not include: switching from a PC to a Mac without thinking it all through VERY carefully.","You know me, all ooh, here's an idea, let's do it now. Not so much with the planning - to a degree, at least, as I do like my lists and my schedules and whatnot. Anyway, even if I was a planner, no amount of planning would have made the PC/Mac switch a walk in the park. 

I'm glad I'm now on a Mac, and I'm enjoying it, now my fingers have been retrained. I love the backlit keyboard of my macbook pro. I love the weight of the thing. I love the weird light that glows like a pulse which I find only a tiny bit disturbing. I love the speed, the simplicity, the colours, the screen, the spotlight thing which actually properly works as a way of finding things, the draggability, the everything. But it has been a trial getting to this place. 

The first day I started to use it, I forgot to bring a mouse with me to the office. So it was all keyboardy / mousepad. Fine, except I had to spend the day in Photoshop, and CS4 has this anti-feature which makes the workspace spin, just spin like crazy, if you accidentally do something with two fingers on the mousepad. And at the same time I had to learn that ctrl is cmd and alt is some weird icon and f5 isn't f5 anymore, and what about all the keyboard shortcuts I've programmed and got used to over the years (ctrl+; for New Guide, for instance) and so on. But, I thought, a couple of days reprogramming my fingers isn't too bad. 

Then a few days later I sat down to do some excel work. I opened my newly installed Excel for Mac 2008 and opened a file. What's this? You can't run macros? You can't use the developer tab? You can't export XML? Turns out Excel for Mac is a huge, pointless con. It's almost as if Microsoft don't want you to use a Mac. Weird, huh. 

Then a few days after that I wanted to do my bookkeeping. Hahaha, you try running Sage on a Mac. Or trying to export a backup from Sage 12 and import it on MS Office Accounting. That's a day of my life I won't get back. 

Oh, and, ha, there was the time I set up my mail on Mail on the mac, but forgot that I have several accounts including info@snowbooks.com which I forgot to set up, and didn't set up junk mail properly, then wondered where all the emails had gone. 

Anyway, all is now perfect. My glorious buddy Rob has set up Virtual Machine which means I basically have a PC running secretly inside my Mac, like a little PC gnome tucked away in the corner there for when I need to do PC-ish things. Not only that, but I have an automagic connection to my old PC which sits in a cupboard somewhere but I can get it running remotely on my mac. I have no idea how that works. It is very clever. AND I can do the same with the server. And I have retired my old 80gb external hard drive and have a jazzy new orange 500gb one. And I have a backup procedure in place, no less. And I am happy - and productive - once more. Sorry for the quietness on the blog as a result of all this - but at least now I'm not on the dark PC side any longer. Rejoice!","","","","2009-10-01","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

We went blackberrying at Kirtlington quarry on my birthday. It was just about the most perfect way to spend an afternoon. Ro ate about 15, straight from the bush, and spilling nary a berry [proud emoticon]. The view from the top was amazing. Then we walked down the Oxford canal. 

If I had been in any way sensibly prepared for such an outing I'd now share photos with you of the berries, the canal in the sun, the impressive quarry hacked out of the Cotswold stone, the way Ro keeps his little finger cocked whilst delicately biting down on a berry. But I didn't take my camera, so all those photos are in my head. Sorry about that. 

Thanks for all the happy birthday wishes! Borders also sent me a bunch of returns (on the Friday but I picked up the email on Saturday) but not the happy birthday kind, bless them.

Just pondering marketing this morning, and some of its more curious manifestations. For instance, Carpet Right sponsor a couple of high-profile TV shows in the UK which means they have their colour-saturated, cheesy, Seventies-feel ads bracketing gritty drama full of edgy camerawork and grey/blue palettes. The lack of fit is jarring. But they've just switched to a new thing: at the start of an act the Carpet Right ad shows a snake crawling across a carpet, at the end, they show a tarantula emerging from a pair of slippers. Edgier for sure. But I hate watching the tarantula and I know my next-door neighbour is terrified of snakes, so that's two viewers who now flinch whenever they see the Carpet Right logo. Who suggested to them that triggering phobias would endear them to the world at large?","As an iPhone user (and fan) I'm also fascinated by what phone companies - who initially claimed the iPhone was an irrelevance or a flop - now say about their attempts to catch up to the iPhone. I've just been trying out Windows Mobile 6.5, which is Microsoft's latest attempt to give you iPhone levels of functionality on a non-Apple smartphone. It certainly looks good. Lots of nicely designed icons, controls and layouts. But it took me a full three minutes to work out how to read a text-message once the phone had told me one had arrived. And I've twice cut people off trying to answer the phone. And replying to a text message almost beat me. None of the first ten things I tried worked. These tasks are easy on cheap phones and obvious on the iPhone. Microsoft have worked on this for a couple of years and they've produced an operating system that hobbles a phone to the point where all I do is turn off as much functionality as it will let me in the hopes I might be able to make it work. It's probably the most frustrating piece of technology I've ever used. Not that you'd know it from their marketing.","","","","2009-10-16","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Actually, while I'm on the subject of dodgy marketing, have you seen the Dixons ads on the tube? In case you can't read that poster image, it says ""Step into middle Englands best loved department store, stroll through haberdashery to the audiovisual department where an awfully well brought up young man will bend over backwards to find the right TV for you."" It concludes, ""Then go to dixons.co.uk and buy it""","It's clearly referring to John Lewis (although there are other ads targetting Selfridges and Harrods). To me, the suggestion is that John Lewis are such suckers that it's easy to get free and friendly help from them even when you have no intention of spending any money there. And moreover, that's something you should take advantage of. I'd have some sympathy if this were investment banks we were supposed to hitch a free ride from. But, really, does anyone hate John Lewis? I remember meeting a couple of employees once and asking them what it was like. One said, ""Well, they pay for my horse riding,"" and the other piped up, ""And they arranged for me to learn a language."" They're owned by their employees and their code of ethics has always been decades ahead of the competition. I'm sure plenty of people browse their stores and end up looking for a bargain online, but having Dixons egg us on feels unsettling. Will they suggest we fare-dodge next? Or shop-lift, maybe? What do you think, does this endear you to Dixons online store? (Plus, there's no way they're the cheapest online source of tellies. Unscrupulous bargain-hunters can surely do better.)","","","","2009-10-16","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Windows 7 is out. 'They' say it's better than Vista. But a lot has happened since Vista was launched. For instance, I've tried Mac OS and decided that I like it better. The pain is that if you want to do businessy stuff, you really can't beat Microsoft Office. I'd probably be fine with a word processor other than Word - just about - but if I'm doing spreadsheets, I want Excel. And Access, if you happened to get really familiar with it - which I did - is darned handy. Especially if you team it with Excel. But that big ribbon thingie in Office 2007 (and 2010) knocks me back to being a beginner again. I know the program has the obscure function I want, but I can't find it. So I'm seriously considering having a little Windows XP simulation running on my Mac, and in it, running my favourite Office application so far: Office 2003. It's fast, it does everything, and I already know how it works. It has to be the way of the future. (Although I'm sticking with Outlook 2007: no ribbon, and it almost works, unlike previous versions.)","","","","","2009-10-26","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

I don't really like feeling stupid. I don't mind feeling <i>comparatively</i> stupid, if it's relative to smart people. But it seems I'm stumped by something that even the dimmest teenager can do. Something that millions of them manage. Probably pre-teens as well. I can't activate a mobile phone sim.

I've got a spare (Vodafone) phone. I've got a pack with a Vodafone PAYG sim in it. All I need to do is get to the stage where I can top up the sim and make/receive calls. The paperwork with the sim says call 17298 on the phone and you're away. I call that number and it says do the whole thing online instead. So I've tried. I've setup my account at Vodafone.co.uk. But there is no option to activate a new PAYG sim. I've searched. And no one on the internet seems to have had this problem. So I've tried registering that phone for 'Pay as you go talk services'. Maybe that's just a fancy way of saying they'll make the phone work. So I click on it, it asks for the phone number, it says it will send a security number to the phone as a text... but the text never arrives. I've even tried going out and buying another sim pack in case the first one was faulty. Dim thirteen-year-olds who get chewing-gum in their hair can do this while playing on their Nintendo DSs. Why can't I?","","","","","2009-10-28","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Here's a spooky halloween tale for any booksellers out there. Do you know about <a href=""http://redlaser.com/"">Red Laser</a> for the iPhone? You fire it up, scan a barcode, and it brings up the product's Amazon listing. And it works over the phone network - in other words, it works in your shop. When I talked about Dixons suggesting you buy TVs from them but use John Lewis's sales people first to pick it out for you, Vanessa worried that the same would happen for books. Well, with Red Laser, it's easy for shoppers to do just that. Go to the bookstore, ping anything interesting you find, and in a few days* it will turn up from Amazon cheaper than you're selling it. And not just on halloween. 

I suppose I could see it happening in Borders or Waterstones - very occasionally - but not in much-beloved local independents. Because, really, do you need to leave the house to buy books from Amazon? Unless you enjoy browsing, you'd stay at home. It'd be like taking sandwiches to your favourite restaurant. 

*maybe in ten or fifteen days. or more. if it's in stock. and unless the post is on strike. or they need a signature and you're out.","","","","","2009-10-31","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Long time readers might remember that I launched The Pub Bench about a year, or two, can't remember, ago. Then, as is my way, I moved on to some other new toy and didn't really push it. The site was quite manual to maintain and I had a silly idea that I'd charge for it (ha, foolish girl, charging for a service! Whatever next.) So the project was mothballed. 

But I think more than ever there's a need for this sort of thing - a place where publishers and other people in the book trade can confidentially share their concerns with their industry peers and swap advice, experience and points of view. 

<a href=""http://www.thepubbench.com"">The Pub Bench</a>","It's the sort of exchange that happens naturally at industry events in the bar - but we can't all be in the bar the whole time. (Well, some of us can, but that gets counter productive very quickly.) So I've rejuvenated the site - and, crucially, thanks to a clever Wordpress plug in, this time I don't need to maintain it (because we all know what my attention span is like). 

So why not join up. It's basically a forum where you can post questions and answer other posters. You have to register to post, but it's free and you are anonymous. 

Here's some more info: 

The Publishers Benchmarking Forum allows publishers to

- compare notes on whats going on in the market, to help you see how your company is performing, relatively. This is known as benchmarking.

Theres a big difference between thinking youre doing something wrong, and knowing that your challenges are the fault of the market. It doesnt mean the challenges go away, but it does mean youre more able to put things into perspective and maintain your confidence in your abilities. And when things are going well, you can judge whether thats because of your genius or because of market forces.

- share ideas, techniques, tricks and insights to improve the running of your company. This is known as, er, sharing!

Its such a shame to have to pay for outside help when you could get help for free, and so tantalising to know how much time and money you could save if only you could find out  NOW  how to do something yourself. The Pub Bench will feature tips and insights  by the community, for the community  into areas like editing, rules of good jacket design, how to prepare files for printers, how to create ebooks, and more hands-on, technical advice to save you time and money. Even if you still outsource the work, you will have insight into whats involved so you can see if your supplier is working efficiently.

So, Waters of Mars, eh? I didn't even realise that a new Doctor Who episode was airing last weekend until I saw the cover of the good old Radio Times (who knew that was still going?). And new Who is always worth discussing. [spoilers]","Very little cringing. On my part I mean. That's my main impression of Waters of Mars. Not that I didn't enjoy it in a positive way too, but the show has had a lot of embarrassing moments lately, and it was a treat that nothing about this episode seemed to need apologising for.

The infected water people looked excellent. The base looked better than I thought the BBC were capable of. And visual effects have now reached the stage where even middling-budget shows can depict something like the surface of Mars without overstretching themselves. And thank goodness they got non-British actors to play some of the non-British roles. It really helps. Makes the whole enterprise seem bigger and more professional. In contrast, earnest Brits putting on accents never seems to work as well as it needs to.

And when you can forget about the acting and accents, the visual effects and sets, and just think about the characters and the story, you're definitely off to a good start. The scares and suspense were familiar fare, but the whole thing motored along fairly well I thought (despite some very heavy-handed scoring). Right up until the end I'd say this was one of the better episodes of the last two years.

Of course, as usual with a Russell T Davies story, the plot didn't <em>totally </em>make sense - at least to me. I'm still at a loss as to why a Mars base nuking itself for reasons which are never discovered was such a powerful inspiration to future generations to go into space. And if the Doctor wanted to leave such a pivotal event undisturbed in the timeline, couldn't he have dropped off the crew he saved in the future somewhere: a dream come true for scientist-explorers, surely - especially when the alternative is instant death. And maybe I missed a plot point (my satellite reception suffered in the high winds), but unless Adelaide's gun vaporised her body, someone would soon find her corpse, gun in hand. How is blowing your brains out in your front room going to inspire your granddaughter to be an explorer? Mystifying. And we're dangerously close to Torchwood territory here, where it's normal to save no one and feel wretched for trying.

That broad streak of nihilism we've got so used to I put down to the outgoing head writer: RTD. He was burnt out on Who two years ago and now only writes stories that humiliate, thwart or torture its hero. And what better way of rejecting the Doctor's help than killing yourself as soon as he's finished rescuing you? 

That's the main thing that niggled for me. Currently we're not allowed to have any happy endings, or uplifting morals, so the plot's conclusion was wrestled and twisted into making the Doctor's inability to let everyone die, even when he knew he should leave well alone, seem as monstrous as possible. Those he rescued recoiled from him (though that didn't stop them accepting a ride home in the first place). The Doctor was left shaken, humiliated and apparently out of control: perfect for RTD, but not exactly what the rest of us tune in for. It really is time to get away from the nihilism.

I've said it before, but RTD needs a nice long holiday - and ideally it should have started a year or two back. He could have gone out on a huge high. I don't want saccharine - I'm delighted that Who is only partly a kid's programme these days - but for a family show, it's been a long time since anything heartwarming happened (Steven Moffat episodes excepted).

I'm dreading what RTD will put the Doctor through this Christmas. Expect the Doctor to hit an all-time low and do things no previous writer would have forced him to do. But then, just over the horizon, is Steven Moffat who - at least for now - is full of optimism and hope. Let's hope that before the long days and BBC politics turn him bitter we get to have some fun with the Doctor.","","","","2009-11-20","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

The other day I was wondering why bookstores don't sell more gift editions. When you take a chance on a new book, you're probably glad it's a paperback, because you don't want to spend a lot of money on something you might hate. But if you love it, you might want to give it as a gift to a friend and the paperback edition's not so good for that. And, personally, I think modern hardbacks are a pain to read and hardly any less ugly than paperbacks. One solution would be for publishers to produce gift editions, maybe boxed, of their previous year's bestsellers in time for Christmas. And just as I was thinking these thoughts I got an e-mail from Anna Lewis at CompletelyNovel talking about their <a href=""http://www.completelynovel.com/personalized-books"">new service</a>: personalised copies of out-of-copyright classics. I haven't tried it out yet, but it has to be worth a go. I'm going to slip into infomercial mode and pass on what Anna says about their service in case you're interested.","<span style=""color: darkred"">Customers can:</span>

You'd have thought this would be the moment of panic; this the point at which I throw my hands up and say 'well that's a lost customer'. Truth is, Borders and their sub brand Books Etc have bought hardly anything from us for the whole year. Our current balance with them is about 100. So on the plus side, if they go bust as a result of being in administration, our cash flow will hardly notice and we won't have to write off any debt. On the downside, it's already been a full year without a retailer who used to account for nearly 20% of our turnover, and it looks like that situation isn't going to change any time soon. Rumour had it that the buying team's budget was slashed, with a veto on buying anything much at all. 

My view is that demand switches, though, rather than disappears. I hope that indie retailers do well out of it, although I suspect Amazon will do better (and Amazon, as I've said before, have returned about 3 copies of books in the last five years and buy about 3000 worth a month, so regardless of what you think about them, they're this indie publisher's friend). I suspect, though, that the 'drunk at 10.30pm in Charing X, pop into Borders to use the loos, buy a book on the way out' dollar is lost forever. I wonder what percentage of Borders' revenue that was? 

And, obviously, thoughts are with all the fine people in the Borders team. Looks like it's yet another ruined Christmas for friends in the booktrade.","","","","","2009-11-26","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","14"

When I was little, and there were only three TV channels, Christmas was pretty exciting because the usual, staid schedule was shaken up and they started showing <em>films</em>. Before everyone got into the habit of owning their favourite movies on pre-recorded (or maybe home-recorded) VHS, films would appear at the cinema and then disappear forever into some mythical, rose-tinted recollection of how good they were. But at Christmas, you might be able to see that one stunt from that amazing Bond movie again. You might even be able to do so while eating a mince pie in front of a log fire.

Then VHS became common, and later DVDs, and then satellite movie channels. And now you can see movies the whole time. So, at least in televisual terms, Christmas is a lot less exciting.

Latterly, things seem to have gone into reverse.","This week my Sky+ box is telling me that three of the shows that I'd normally watch just aren't on this week or the next or the next. They'll pop up again some time in January, by which time I'll struggle to remember what was going on. Presumably that's to make way for extra carol services (which, at least in principle, sounds appealing) or the 66th rerun of a Morecambe and Wise Christmas Special (which appeals a little less). In some cases, it's also to make sure that episodes of an American show don't get aired here before they do in the States. So I can only imagine how dire Christmas TV must be in the States (I do know they replace new episodes of shows with repeats at seemingly random intervals). All in all, it makes me wonder how many viewers popular shows lose in the Christmas disruption and what the goal of Christmas scheduling is these days. Am I being too Bah-Humbuggy, or is there some yuletide magic to Christmas telly that I'm missing?","","","","2009-12-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

And so to Centrepoint where I took part in the Futur(e)book conference. I was talking about using ebooks as marketing tools (slides below). Amongst other initiatives, we've used Facebook to communicate directly with readers, and to offer them a free ebook of the first in a series - hoping that once they've finished it, if they love it, they'll buy the next one.

As well as Facebook, we use Issuu.com too. Check out some of the viewing numbers on our page on <a href=""http://www.issuu.com/snowbooks"">issuu.com</a> . 31,000 views of George Mann's The Shattered Teacup. 25000 views of Thomas Emson's When Soft Voice Die. 17,000 views of Family Cycling. Even our automatically generated <a href=""http://issuu.com/snowbooks/docs/marketing"">pack of AIs</a> enjoyed 6000 views. These are sensational numbers for a tiny publisher. And a gazzillion views is going to result in something happening somewhere - if a tiny percentage of those viewers loved the work and buy Thomas' and George's next book, that's pretty effective marketing since it costs nothing to put books on issuu.com.

The last time I mentioned manmade climate change I got a lot of comments telling me it didn't exist (or was nothing much to worry about). The reasons given tended to contradict each other, but the sentiment was shared: we can't agree on why, but we know humans aren't disrupting the climate. That strange pseudo-consensus really confuses me.

Having just read Ben Goldacre's <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/dec/12/bad-science-goldacre-climate-change"">latest article</a>, I thought I'd pass along the <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/index/#Responses"">link </a>he mentions to <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/index/#Responses"">realclimate.org</a> which contains a refutation of the most common reasons people give for discounting manmade climate disruption. Maybe, if your favourite reason is on <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/index/#Responses"">the list</a> you might want to read the rebuttal. Or maybe you'd rather not. Really, the whole thing has me perplexed.

As the Goldacre article puts it: <span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">""why do roughly half the people in this country not believe in man-made climate change, when the overwhelming majority of scientists do?</span>"" And I can't believe the answer is that <strong>non</strong>-scientists are just better at understanding this stuff.","On the other hand, Dara O'Briain had a much more inflammatory (and amusing) point of view on Radio 4's The Infinite Monkey Cage. He thought that people don't like to be told their opinion isn't valid. They feel they have a right to be heard. And they therefore object to disciplines where the opinion of a partly-informed layman is considered worthless.

I've also heard the view that until Governments take this stuff seriously and start making big changes, non-technical voters aren't likely to believe their empty words on the subject. And Ben Goldacre adds that anyway we don't trust governments to tell us the truth. They sometimes lie about the big stuff (like wars) and they fired Prof. Nutt for voicing the truth out of turn.

Whatever's going on here, I hope that either the sceptics can hurry up and explain to the climate scientists where they've been going wrong or the opposite can happen. Because when the well-informed experts say we're in deep trouble, it doesn't make me feel better to learn that millions of non-experts disagree; it makes me feel much worse.","","","","2009-12-14","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Here's the sort of thing that annoys me: ""<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">Simon & Schuster, in tandem with other big houses, is trying to protect income from print books by delaying the publication of new ebooks by four or six months after release of the hardback editions.</span>""

It's from an article about the rise and rights of ebooks <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/dec/15/stephen-covey-amazon-ebook-deal"">here</a>. It's the notion of 'protecting income' that pushes my buttons. Yes, publishers must strive to make money, but they are not monarchs of the written word and they have no god-given right to charge a toll on the road between authors and readers.","The market tolerates the cost that publishers add to the book supply-chain because they add even more value. In the past, it was almost impossible for an author to print and sell her books without involving a publisher. Publishers made the whole process happen. They were vital. But that's less true everyday. The gap between authors and readers gets smaller each year, with less of a need for publishers to bridge it.

So what publishers must do is rack their brains for ways to add more value to justify the costs they add - or they must dwindle. What they shouldn't do is make themselves the guardians of traditional revenue streams because that pits the middle against both ends. When a publisher takes a stand that doesn't help authors and isn't what the public are demanding, they create an incentive for the market to route around them. That's happening anyway and 'protecting income' only hastens it.

New channels often cannibalise old ones, so your choice is to do the canniblisation yourself (and hopefully retain a good chunk of your income) or to let someone else do it for you (and risk losing everything). You see it in all 'middlemen' content providers. Music companies never liked selling you downloads instead of CDs (so they put as many restrictions as possible on their use). Movie companies don't like selling you downloaded movies instead of shiny disks (so they make them evaporate after a few night's 'rental'). And many publishing companies would really prefer it if you smashed your Kindle and went back to paper.

Technology companies embrace this. They don't prevent you from buying this year's computer until all of last year's stocks have been sold. They find the newest, sexiest products and they try to make them unbearably desirable. Suddenly you're spending a fortune on things you didn't even know you needed three weeks ago. In other words, instead of 'protecting income' they create and then fulfil new demand. And publishers need to learn those lessons. They need to let go of the idea that sustainable profit comes from charging extra for wibalin.","","","","2009-12-16","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

There is something about the way that technological progress affects the world of publishing that I keep coming back to. It starts with what various pundits (and, I suppose, Karl Marx originally) called the 'means of production'. Every year it gets easier to be not only the author of a book, but its publisher - at least in the limited sense of being able to arrange the production of a pallet of professionally-printed paperbacks from the comfort of your own laptop.

But maybe that's OK because, as we all know, publishers perform other important roles besides FTPing files to the printers and saying 'go!'. For a start, they act as gate-keepers to the retailers - and the retailers in turn act as gate-keepers to the readers. Books generally have to pass through both sets of gates to stand a chance of building a readership. But that publishing gate-keeper role is not about consensus. Publishers each have their own idea about what's printworthy. I've lost track of how many blockbusting millionaire authors were turned down by the first fifteen publishers they approached.","And that gatekeeping role is much less relevant once an author has a little success under their belt. Write a successful book and finding a publisher for your follow-up is usually a breeze compared with the first time around. Being established opens doors. 

Another thing we're all agreed on is that e-books aren't going to displace paper books completely - or anywhere close to it - any time soon. But there's also plenty of evidence that e-books will soon (or already do) make up a worthwhile fraction of book sales.

And that's important because while DIY authors <i>could</i> in principle print their own paper books, not many are likely to do it. I mean, what do you do with them once they're printed unless you also have an established position in the book supply chain? Who's going to sell them for you? Not Waterstones.

But that won't necessarily apply with e-books. Why wouldn't Amazon list your self-published novel? If it never sells, it never sells, but they haven't got to dust a shelf full of copies sat in their warehouse. It's just data on a hard-drive somewhere. They could even charge you what I will now christen a 'bit-dusting fee' for the privilege of keeping your 1MB e-novel on their servers. And even if Amazon refuse to list you directly, there are bound to be plenty of e-publishers who will electronically 'publish' you - which is to say, they'll upload your novel under their imprint on Amazon (no gatekeeping involved there).

And should people actually read your effectively-self-published novel on their Kindles, etc, in any significant numbers, it'll be a doddle to get a 'real' paperback deal with a traditional publisher because now you're market-tested and reader-approved.

So on the one hand, the physical processes of traditional publishing gets easier every year. A copy of Photoshop, a copy of InDesign and a little know-how can turn any Microsoft Word manuscript into a set of print-ready PDFs. And if you can't do it yourself, someone else will help you, if you cross their palm with silver. Self-publishing on paper gets easier and cheaper ever single year. Which means that controlling the publishing 'means of production' becomes less of a <i>raison d'etre</i> for publishers every year too.

And on the other hand, the quality-control aspect of the publisher's role is likely to get some competition from e-books because a whole new channel is springing up where traditional publishers/gatekeepers won't necessarily get a say. 

So will e-books become a common way to do an 'end-run' around the traditional gatekeepers of publishing? Will that mean that e-books become the format for the most exciting, groundbreaking writing? Certainly it could be priced in a way that makes it cheaper - and therefore more feasible - to take a chance on an unknown author in a way that paper books, with their built in costs, couldn't duplicate.

But most interesting of all to me will be to see how publishers react to the gradual erosion of their place in the world. Not that it will cease to exist, but as the waters rise, it might well become rather crowded. And with technology bringing down the barriers keeping people out, the number of publishing houses could easily swell far beyond what the market can sustain (which is also likely to erode the gatekeeping role - because it makes it easier to find some publisher somewhere who likes your book).

How many people feel confident that publishing will look broadly similar in ten years' time? And those of you who are publishers, do you still expect to be publishers in 2020?","","","","2010-01-25","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">26 per cent - a rise of 10 per cent in just three months - do not believe the world is getting hotter.</span> <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1248940/How-belief-climate-change-draining-away-number-doubters-rises-10-months.html#ixzz0epuUiWwr"">link</a>

I really didn't see this coming. Apparently a <i>decreasing</i> number of people accept the idea of manmade climate change. A couple of screw-ups and a bit of fudging by some researchers has invalidated the whole concept for a lot of people and apparently that's giving the Conservative Party some political cover to back off on their pledges to do something about CO2 levels if (when) they get into power (<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/07/climate-scepticism-grows-tories"">link</a>).","What's strange to me - so strange I can't get my head round it - is that this is equivalent to an asteroid heading towards Earth. Some people say it's big and will kill billions of people and render huge areas uninhabitable for humans. Others say it's not there or it's tiny. But then you talk to the top thousand astronomers and find they're as-near-as-makes-no-difference unanimous that it's at the very least medium-sized, will definitely create an unprecedented catastrophe for the human race and it's on its way. 

But if it were an asteroid, I can't help thinking most ordinary non-scientists would be freaking out rather than confidently blas&eacute; and they'd be clamouring for more telescopes <i>right now</i> and demanding definite answers with frantic urgency.

And if, instead of climate changes that threaten billions, this was a terrorist plot threatening a few thousand, we'd have happily turned our world upside down attempting to combat it.

I understand that a lot of people are sceptical about manmade climate change, but very few of them  truly know what they are talking about. And practically all of the people who <i>do</i> know what they're talking about are saying that a global catastrophe is just around the corner. We're as certain of manmade climate change as we were uncertain about Iraqi WMD and yet the response to non-existent missiles is orders of magniture greater than our attempt to protect our future. Where is our national ability to get into a lather when it finally might do some good? If only climate change was suspected of causing AIDS, cancer or Bird/Swine flu. And was exacerbated by GM crops in those who'd received the MMR jab. Then we'd see some public concern.","","","","2010-02-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

Imagine you're me and you started a company a few years back, and stuff happened, time passed, and then seven years later you get a review like that for a book you're publishing from a childhood hero. Chuffed doesn't begin to cover it. 

Oh yes, and I'm going to New York next week. With Ro. Whee!","""This is an exhilarating romp through a witty combination of 19th century English fact and fiction.  Mark Hodder definitely knows his stuff and has given us steam opera at its finest.  In this first novel he shows himself to be as clever and inventive a writer as those who enliven his pages. We follow English explorer and eroticist (and King's agent) Sir Richard Francis Burton, poet and Sadean Algernon Charles Swinburne and a cast including Florence Nightingale, Charles Darwin, Francis Galton and Isambard Kingdom Brunel  (rather different to those known to our Victorian ancestors) as well as the mysterious albino Laurence Oliphant in an adventure involving the very nature of Time itself in a London filled with steam-horses and velopicides where were-wolves prowl the streets and 'Spring-Heeled Jack', star of the Penny Dreadfuls, might provide the key to an ever-deepening mystery. A great, increasingly complex, plot, fine characters and invention that never flags! It gets better and better, offering clues to some of Victorian London's strangest mysteries.

Well, in radio terms, the almost unthinkable has happened. A new series of<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00fbnb7""> Fags, Mags and Bags</a> has started and I've already missed a week. It's my favourite thing on radio, so that's quite a blow. BBC iPlayer will let me grab episode 2, but episode 1 is already lost to the ether. 10 days after broadcast the wavefront of the program will be around 260 billion kilometers from Earth, well beyond the orbit of Pluto. My chances of getting a radio and a tape recorder out there in order to record the programme are slim. So unless the BBC rebroadcasts it, or someone else on planet Earth decides to share their copy, I'll have to make do with the other five episodes of this series. But still, five episodes of radio comedy gold is cause for celebration. Unless something else goes wrong...","","","","","2010-02-20","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

Thanks to all those who saw my anguish at missing the first episode of the new season of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fags,_Mags_and_Bags"">Fags, Mags and Bags</a> and rushed forward to help. Em even got an e-mail from one of the cast (good samaritan <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Raza"">Omar Raza</a>, who plays Sanjay) who sorted me out with a download of the episode in question. I consider that to be decidedly amazing and great. I also thought, while I was on this subject, that I might try to explain what it is I like about the show, just in case anyone out there has a moment's curiosity on that score.","Not to get too high-falutin' about it, but I think a lot of modern art (20th Century and beyond) relies too much on shock tactics. Make a visual representation of something taboo and you're much more likely to get yourself some gallery space. Do something socially unacceptable on stage and your marketing will take care of itself. But I don't consider controversy to be especially creative. In fact it can seem like artists are working their way down a tick list at times. 

And I think the desire to shock means that cutting-edge art often deals in extremes. I think I've complained about this before, but I've lost track of the number of 'contemporary literature' novels I've read that deal with madness. Madness is an artistic licence to go wherever you want and as far as you want. And it's catnip to hip authors looking to brew up a bit of polemic. But I don't think it always has much to do with real life as most of us live it.

Similarly, a lot of 'indie' comedy, particularly in the Nineties was very transgressive. Pick a taboo subject and tackle it with the maximum amount of effing-and-jeffing and you're bound to get plenty of shock laughs. No gag was so funny that it couldn't be punched up with the right handful of swear words. But again, that's not real life for a lot of people. It restricts comedy so that it mainly pleases drunk university students, just as Tracy Emin and Damien Hirst fail to connect with a lot of ordinary punters. In the last decade, shock comedy went mainstream with the invention of the 'gross out' comedy, where it seemed that conversations only drunk men would have somehow became movie scripts.

Does that make me sound like a prude? The thing is, I don't mind people swearing. And I'm not often offended by what you might call vulgar comedy. But not being offended isn't the same thing as being entertained. The harder someone tries to get a laugh by grossing out their audience, the more I suspect they don't have anything amusing to say. A lot of people love it, but to me it seems needy and it smacks of desperation. As far as I'm concerned, gentle comedy is the real art form because it can't rely on the cheap pyrotechnics of shock value and f-bombs. It's got to construct its laughs from ordinary, household ingredients. 

Of course, gentle comedy risks becoming twee or corny or dull, but when it's done right it has real warmth and charm, in a way that no crude tirade about bodily functions can ever achieve. Gentle comedy can be inclusive and uplifting. It can be beautifully observed and it can contain rich structure. It can generate worlds we want to live in and it can stir our sympathies. None of these things are possible with in-your-face and aggressive comedy-club-style standup.

Fags, Mags and Bags (FMB) knows when it's flirting with clich&eacute; or when it's spinning familiar tropes, and it has fun with that. It has the slightly farcical plot structure in which fate swiftly punishes the guilty and all more or less returns to the <i>ante status quo</i> at the end of every episode, but that's how most short-form storytelling works: sudden reversals and unlikely coincidences heighten and condense the themes of the story. And FMB has such fun with them.

The show also turns its potential critics into characters and drags them into the story. Sanjay represents the BBC's all-important youth demographic, who would hate FMB. His character is too cool to be impressed by anything he is actually likely to encounter and he is mercilessly mocked for his attempts to be aloof and unimpressed by everything real life has to offer. Whereas Alok, if his character were suddenly to become a writer of FMB, would make the show grittier, punchier and give it up-to-the-minute mass appeal. In other words he would ruin it. And his character is also mocked for his insistence that a comfy present should be jettisoned as quickly as possible in favour of a poorly-thought-out flash-in-the-pan future.

The faults of FMB are the same faults that P.G.Wodehouse and Jerome K. Jerome share. They are what they are - and unapologetically so. They don't break new ground, they don't shatter preconceptions, they don't deliver anything in the way of adrenaline. They're the opposite of 'gross out' comedy. They celebrate the exact same things that real friends find funny when they chat together. The show looks for its humour in the same places that ordinary people look, and because it's written so skilfully, it finds more of it than most of us do.

For some reason, comedy seems to have two powerful effects. It can cut things down to size - perhaps even destroy them - and it can build people up and make us feel good. Tina Fey probably deserves all our gratitude for helping make sure that Sarah Palin is not currently Vice President. But there's no reason that the power of comedy must always be used to vaporise things. Just as useful and just as skilful is comedy that gives us a nice warm glow. Anyone interested in the latter is invited to slip into the relaxing, Radox bath that is Fags, Mags and Bags.




Instead, they are perfect worlds that anyone who hasn't had all their nerve endings fried by too much exposure to the media's mutated version of real life might happily","","","","2010-02-24","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Anna, who for the purposes of this discussion I might call ""Snowbooks' secret weapon"" (although, strictly speaking we do have more than one secret weapon) made a fine and eloquent point recently, in between discussions of kittens, about the way content and the marketing of that content can get in each other's way. 

""<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">I really wanted to like the American version of 'Who Do You Think You Are?' -- it's an interesting subject, after all -- but I can't stand wasting time hearing about what's coming up after the commercial break. If you have to plan a teaser for every segment, just so people won't wander away, there's probably something fundamentally wrong with your content (or you've severely underestimated your viewers).</span>""","I've had previous grumbles about something similar myself, like the practice of summarising a (scripted) TV or radio show just before you air it. ""And now: an unexpected visit from Dave's ex has far-reaching consequences, particularly for Paul and Rachel."" Arggghhh! Are there really people out there who only make the decision to watch a program or not in the six seconds before it starts. I mean, if you know who Dave, Paul and Rachel are, presumably you're a regular. (Although they're hypothetical in this case.) And why sacrifice the enjoyment of the loyal viewer in favour of Gadfly McChannel-Changer?

The battle between showing the show and marketing the show plays out in all sorts of arenas. Trailers of all types - but especially movie trailers - are a prime example. The forgettable 1985 Smith-and-Jones comedy <em>Morons From Outer Space</em> was notable for being the first time that every funny moment from a movie was in the long version of the trailer. It was the first, but undoubtedly not the last. Only if you know people are going to come and see your movie could you afford to respect the audience by giving nothing important away in the trailer - or so the logic goes. I saw <em>The Blind Side</em> in the States. Presumably that movie is close to a guaranteed success in the UK what with the feel-good plot, the positive press and the S. Bullock Oscar. But the UK TV trailer which highlights the 'best lines' is also giving away the major plot points at the same moment.

This really is one area where the much-vaunted and little-delivered promise of interactive media could help. I hope that at some point in the future you can opt out of spoilerish marketing if you pre-emptively promise to watch the darn thing they're intent on ruining for you. The pact would be ""If I promise to watch your movie would you kindly not spoil it for me in advance."" Though I imagine 'opt out' marketing would make the marketeers nervous. You'd probably have to actually purchase your cinema ticket or pay for the DVD before they'd <em>risk </em>leaving you spoiler free. (But then again, a lot of people like spoilers because they like instant gratification.)

Of course this is also where what I call 'honest marketing' could come in. If anyone ever develops something akin to Amazon's Recommendations - but which actually works* - then we might be prepared to watch what we're told to watch without needing a deluge of hype to sway us. But the marketeer's temptation to abuse or rig a Recommendations system would be so great - and their restraint is so notoriously weak - that I can't quite picture it happening. Until then, the fast forward button is my friend. As a rule: watch/listen to nothing but the show itself and you might remain spoiler-free (though I've still been caught out by the occasional late announcer's desperate voice-over attempts to reveal the first act twist to me before the programme begins). 

The other question I suppose is how many of us as audience members would like to enjoy a book, movie or TV show un-spoilered. It's tempting to find out tidbits about something you're really looking forward to. Would it require too much self-restraint to say 'no' to cool-looking trailers and revealing interviews? And are others (and not just me) convinced that spoilers give you a short-term treat at the expense of overall enjoyment? If you're not convinced that spoilers spoil then maybe you see them as 'bonus content' and want whatever you can get. Am I accidentally championing fuddy-duddy-ism here? Don't eat sweets or you'll ruin your appetite for sprouts later. Surely not.

Or, if you bought a children's book as a gift, maybe you'd like to buy some for yourself.","","","","2010-03-23","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

If you have a moment - and you haven't already done this - why not have a look at the e-book capabilities of Apple's new iPad. Go <a href=""http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/ibooks.html"">here</a>, click on the video, and see what you think. To me it looks sensational. Us Snowbookers always used to say that 'one day' Apple would release an 'iBook' (or whatever it would be called) and <em>then</em> we'd see whether the world liked reading e-books or not. Well, tomorrow, that's happening. And this is just Apple's first try. They've shown, with the iPhone especially, that they're pretty good at a) getting it right first time and b) building on that success slowly but surely. So does anyone think this won't be big?","And do remember that the iPad is not just a handheld computer with e-book-reader software, it's also a platform for apps. You must have seen the TV adverts for apps on the iPhone, so you know what I'm talking about. Already there's what looks like an amazingly cool interactive encyclopedia about the periodic table. Go <a href=""http://periodictable.com/ipad/index.html"">here</a> for a glimpse - though foolishly they don't seem to have created a movie to give you a proper sense of what's on offer. (Edit: BoingBoing have a video review of the app <a href=""http://www.boingboing.net/2010/04/01/the-elements-for-ipa.html#more"">here</a>, if you want to see what I'm talking about.)

Apparently, the iPad will give you more or less instant access to all the out-of-copyright books on Gutenberg. And I very much like the idea of jumping to a phrase you remember or tapping a word to get a definition (or presumably a Wikipedia explanation either now or soon).

I suppose the downside is that this is a gadget for the rich, by which I mean that it's only in reach of maybe 50% of the population of North America, Europe, Japan et al. And even then you need a computer and an internet connection. (Which actually doesn't seem too restrictive in 2010.) And I accept the following drawbacks - none of which happen to matter to me:
1) if you drop it in the bath it will probably be irreparably damaged
2) it will not smell like a book
3) you cannot use it to build an ego-wall of all the books you have ever read
4) there may be an intangible feeling you get from a paper book which your sub-conscious will choose not to extend to an iPad (though be aware, lots of people will have the opposite experience: i.e. feel awed by a futuristic gadget in a way that a stack of paper glued down one side will never achieve.)

And the darn thing isn't even primarily a book reader. There's all this other amazing stuff you can do on it, so (the theory goes) you'll probably have it with you anyway for e-mail, watching movies, web-surfing, games, etc; so why carry paper books as well?

Mind you, Cory Doctorow's theory is that any device that does other, eye-catching things, like let you check your e-mail, will be so distracting that few people will read long-form fiction on it.

So any thoughts?

And if tomorrow weren't significant enough anyway, what with it being the day the publishing industry gets its first proper glimpse of the future, it's also the day for new Doctor Who.

Would it be fun to make a list of all the reasons you couldn't or shouldn't self-publish in 1950 and then check that against an updated list for 2010? I mean, I don't even know how a novel was typeset back then, but I'm fairly sure it couldn't be done on the same bit of technology used to write the manuscript (i.e. a typewriter or a fountain pen). And how was it delivered to the printers? Hmm, I don't know that either. Likewise cover art - though I assume that was done with photographic plates of some kind. Anyway, the point is, that a person these days could write a book and then get someone to typeset it, design a cover and produce print-ready PDFs without spending much money at all. They could even get it printed by, say, <a href=""http://www.lulu.com/"">Lulu</a>. But what to do with it after that? Even listing it on Amazon is a pain because how are you going to distribute stock to them and sort out the paperwork? So, phew, still a few reasons to involve a publisher. Unless e-books take off. I mention all this because it's just got a bit easier to go the e-book route. <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/04/get-your-e-book-on-the-ipad-and-keep-all-the-royalties.ars"">Bibliocore</a> will put your book up on Apple's iBookstore, ready for iPad owners to buy it. And they'll even let you keep the royalties. So what does that leave for publishers to do that it's tricky to do for yourself? 
1) Decide whether the book is any good or not. Though perhaps the first wave of readers could do that in a pinch. (Might authors give away the first 200 copies of their book for that reason?)
2) Market the book.
What else am I missing? I mean it might be nice if someone proof-read the thing, but an author could pay an outside proof-reader to do that just the way a publisher currently does. What else?","","","","","2010-04-08","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","7"

I want to say something about iPhones, but before you start thinking that this is a technology blog, I'm only bringing it up to talk about corporate attitudes rather than about bits and bytes. The more I look at what Apple are doing at the moment, the more it seems like they're working hard to take over the world. And I don't mean that in a bad way. They really seem like they're trying hard and doing a more grown-up job of joining the dots than any of their competitors.

Apple have just announced a new update to the iPhone's operating system. OS updates sound like dull things, but in these days of clever software, changing the OS changes the phone. 90% of the things that made the iPhone revolutionary are in the software. If the iPhone had merely been a phone - a piece of hardware - and it had run, say, Microsoft's mobile phone OS, no one would even remember it by now. And the thing is, the OS update Apple have just announced contains a lot of features that people were half-expecting to see three years ago when the phone first came out. But Apple weren't ready then. They knew if they added those features in the wrong way, it would compromise the phone's appeal and usefulness, so they waited. They looked at how everyone else did it and what worked. They looked at what sorts of features actually conferred useful benefits and which were just marketing glitter. They looked at the privacy and security considerations and three years down the line they came up with their own approach. And now, to recycle a cliche, the best will be even better. And my point is, I don't think I've ever worked in a big company that would be capable of acting that way with that level of both perfectionism and restraint. But that's what you need if you want take over the world.","Perhaps my experiences aren't all that representative, but I've been part of a few corporate teams developing new products or processes or 'channels'. And in every single case, they sounded more like a pilot for a satirical sit-com than a basis for successful innovation. The person in charge would have been selected as part of their career grooming, or because no one good was available. Important projects need managers senior enough to push through what needs doing - often chosen regardless of relevant expertise or interest. Other team members from other departments would be selected to avoid ruffling feathers or to help achieve 'buy in' back in their own teams. And very rarely did these projects involve seconding anyone away from their day-jobs: changing the world had to be accomplished on top of a very full day-job. And if the manager was on secondment, it often meant they were being eased out of the business - a period spent working on 'special projects' being a way of separating them from their normal responsibilities while giving them plenty of time to ring round looking for 'opportunities' elsewhere. 

I suppose I've been particularly unlucky because clearly not all design teams are like that, otherwise nothing would ever get built, but I struggle to think of any organisation that could match Apple in placing  such a premium on technical know-how and then marry it with mature design. Or the will to override marketing considerations by withholding features for years if needs be - but then, when they were ready, putting marketing firmly in the driving seat to produce a product launch the whole computing world would be talking about.

And bewitched as I am by it all, I'm still trying to put my finger on exactly what Apple are doing differently that's allowing them to eat Microsoft's lunch - not to mention Nokia's and HP's and Dell's - more or less at will. Perfectionism is part of it - a very big part. Restraint is another: excelling at something or leaving it to others - not dabbling, not dipping toes in the water, not 'playing catch-up'. Apple don't even seem to be competing with anyone. They plough their own furrow and they do it in a way that ignores everyone's idea of what the rules are - which in effect re-writes them. And I suspect there must be some other 'value' in there which places design ahead of technical capability or marketability. They strive to make their devices beautifully designed to do what they do and everything else is in service to that goal. And by doing so, they can stake out the most profitable part of the market and hold it (so far) against all-comers. They are definitely not perfect, but just at this second in time, I think Apple are a company almost all of us could learn something from.","","","","2010-04-09","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

Re: Doctor Who. Oh dear. Today's episode I found a bit boring. Then I watched Dr Who Confidential and was really impressed with all the clever ideas the story contained and how nicely they came together. Except those good points came across much more strongly from listening to the cast and Mr. Moffat talk about it than from watching the episode. Darn. But, still. Good cast, <em>fundamentally</em> good writing - but, for some reason, staged like an episode from the Seventies. So still plenty of hope for the future.

Sigh. On the million to one chance that you acted in or wrote tonight's Doctor Who episode stop reading now, because I'm going to be horrible about you. I still think Karen Gillan (=Amy) is great value for money - and Bill Patterson (=Bracewell) conjured up a bit of magic when called upon. But everything and everyone else was horrible. I'm afraid Ian McNeice's (=Churchill) talents are invisible to me; I don't care much for any of Mark Gatiss's scripts - charming fellow though he appears to be - and an unbearable thought is beginning to dawn on me: I am starting to suspect that Matt Smith can't act. My theory of bad acting is that those without ability can only do two things 1) confusion and 2) anger. That's all Martha Jones could manage and I'm starting to think it's all Matt Smith can summon up as well. Why couldn't David Tennant have put in one more year? Steven Moffat scripts, the marvellous Karen Gillan, and DT wringing every last bead of emotion from the drama. Alas. What might have been.","","","","","2010-04-17","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

Day one of the London Book Fair: and you know what, I loved it! Not least because it was the first time in more than 20 months that I have worn heels. *And* I drank coffee on a train. Get me. This is because Ro stayed with his daddy all day long. Heavens, I missed him. But I did get to wear a skirt. 

The Fair was a bit odd because, hmm, where was everyone? Stuck in Dubai / Dublin / insert city of choice accessible only by plane. Rather handily, though, the clearing out of 30%* of the expected population meant that a lot of people were just wandering round looking for something to do. A nice lady showed me photos of her baby. An important CEO stopped by to relieve the boredom. People who tried to avoid eye contact with me failed because there was no one else to hide behind, and so got pounced on by the catalogue-waving weirdo I was.

Doctor Who. The Time Of Angels. Liked every bit of it. Exciting, funny, clever and (if you find that sort of thing troubling) rather scary. Even Mr Matt Smith seemed to find a few lines to get his teeth into. Perhaps it was the good example he was being set on all sides that did it. More like this please. (Note to commenters: I don't watch the spoilers included at the end of each episode so please don't say something like 'really looking forward to next week when [this thing] happens'. And maybe write 'spoilers' at the top if you're going to get into the nuts and bolts of the episode, for the benefit of foreigners and old people who might not have watched it yet.)

Also, while I'm on the subject, surely it's about time for the BBC to take their flagship show and start shifting it madly around in the schedule as well as skipping a week or two. How can they resist with so many viewers? Think of the annoyance they could cause. Which in turn leads me on to linking to this <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k3Ws--yQu8"">blissfully brilliant clip</a> from Being Human on the subject of emotional connection and TV scheduling (is too sweary for work - unless you work somewhere like Snowbooks.)

When I've talked to publishers, they often seem to use outside agencies or freelancers for their graphic design, website design and, you know, anything involving colours. So I don't know if there are Photoshop gurus out there, but if you do spend your days tweaking images you might get a kick out of this tutorial for colour-correcting film footage to look like the big Hollywood movies. It's principally interesting for how it opens your eyes to the enormous extent that footage has been manipulated before you get to watch it.

Blimes. Just got some paperwork through from a liquidator who was tying up loose ends for one of the many companies to go belly up in the last few years (although this one was because of a dodgy principal rather than a tricksy market). Guess what the hourly rate is for a liquidator? Nope, wrong. *500*. Mind you, the job must be rubbish. Anyway, I got a cheque for 96 which is better than nothing I suppose, although it comes in at 0.02% of what we were owed. Hey nonny. 

////Update////

Phew, thank goodness for Ol' Beady Rob who spotted that the 0.02% I stated above would mean we were owed about half a million quid. My language would have been stronger if that had been the case. The liquidator's letter was wrong: creditors didn't get 0.0218%, they got 2.18%. The total owed to the creditors was 306,422 but in total they received 6706.

Really bad book covers? Thanks to <a href=""http://boingboing.net/"">BoingBoing</a> I've just stepped up to my neck in them. <a href=""http://www.goodshowsir.co.uk/"">Good Show Sir</a> is full of awful sci-fi/fantasy covers like the one you're looking at now. 

It really takes me back to when I used to stand in my local bookshop after school, trying to decide which ripsnorting sci-fi yarn to buy, with only horribly written blurbs and horribly designed covers to guide me. And later I could never figure out why the front cover might contain, say, a space gunfight with aliens that turned out not to occur in a story which might have been set, say, entirely on Earth with no aliens anywhere. And I can honestly say that it never occurred to me that the reason might be a publisher who didn't really care that much. Or to be charitable, a publisher who suspected they were a <em>little</em> out but didn't have the time or money to do anything about it. I have to say, looking back, that I see it now as a low-level sort of contempt. I wonder how many publishers thought sci-fi readers were so undiscriminating that it didn't matter. Whereas the truth was that I pored over books the same way I pored over album covers for favourite bands (which, back in the days of Roger Dean, might have contained exactly the same artwork). I'm pretty sure I even read 'The Star Beast' back in the day. If I remember rightly, it's a sort of precursor to ET, if ET were more like a brainy elephant than a brainy monkey.

Flesh and Stone was good, wasn't it? I <em>think</em> it was. I certainly didn't dislike anything about it. Yet I felt a slight lack of satisfaction that I couldn't shake. But this might just be part of the natural ebb and flow of Weltschmerz we all experience. BUT! But next week's episode is written by the chief writer and creator of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_Human_%28TV_series%29"">Being Human</a>. Last Who Review I happened to mention Being Human, and soon we'll see what it will look like to transplant a little piece of that creativity into the Whoniverse.

For a little more pontification on this week's episode (not to mention spoilers), read on.","Having said I didn't dislike anything about Flesh and Stone, I did chafe slightly at the idea of the angels freezing out of instinct because they assumed Amy was looking at them. They're supposed to turn to stone when you observe them - not just hold still. Wouldn't you notice that you weren't stone? (I'm prepared to ignore Angel Bob being able to talk while being observed. Maybe he was in the back, not 'quantum locked', just lurking.)

And I'm still having terrible trouble interpreting Matt Smith's emotions. I can't tell the difference between dejection and elation. Or between panic because things are going badly and exultation because things are going well. Look at the reaction shots when Amy closes her eyes and her vitals return to normal. You can see the tension leave Alex Kingston's body along with the breath she's been holding. Matt Smith breathes through an open mouth and half-smiles, which doesn't convey anything to me. Out of context I might have guessed he was expressing 'realisation'. I wouldn't have guessed 'relief' and yet that's what those reaction shots are for: to tell us an important dramatic change has occurred. And so long as MS's emoting remains more or less unfocused I feel like the drama is a boat with one of its oars out of the water.

The rest of the acting was tip-top, however. And the editing and camera setups are definitely better. They still compress pauses that should be longer, stay wide when they should be in close on a face, and cut to angles you're not interested in, but it definitely seems better. And the production design looked pretty spiffy (for a British show). Mind you, the foley people need a smack for the loud computer beeps-and-bloops that emanated from the trees once their access hatch was removed - as well as the confusing crunching with occasional bamf noises used to convey that angels were nearby. And while I'm nitpicking, it might have been nice to see an angel actually move quickly for once. Even when they advanced on Amy they were creaky (with lots of grinding stone noises), whereas we know they're lightning fast. Maybe next time.

And I see the BBC have <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/apr/26/bbc-apologises-doctor-who-trailer"">apologised</a> for the Graham Norton animation they ran during last week's episode. Fortunately for me they didn't interfere with the HD version I was watching. Mark my words, though: the BBC will find some way to screw things up. I'm still betting it will involve messing with the scheduling in order to show an important snooker game or unexpected ballroom dancing finale.

A final, more general point I wanted to make about Karen Gillan's acting: it's not perfect, but something I like very much about it is that she plays 'tough' without the usual misguided clich&eacute;s. That's to say her 'tough' isn't just about being aggressive or shouting or scowling. She's tough while being playful and vulnerable and it doesn't detract from how capable her character appears. I wish more tough women characters were played that way, because being impressive in a crisis is definitely not about being the crossest (a mistake that most American military dramas make (for their male characters too), and which the Bourne series avoids, making it something quite special - Bourne never blusters or tries to bully anyone - he just gets on with it). But back to Karen: they have her whine 'Doctor' a little too much, but her flatly-commanding 'explain!' combined with her steady, challenging gaze is excellent. Less is more when it comes to authority. (Which seems to be what Scarlett Johansson is up to in Iron Man 2, and I suspect it's the only way to make a character like that believable.)","","","","2010-05-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

So I can run a Creative Suite app and let it grab 12GB of RAM and all four cores if it needs to do some heavy lifting. This is highly preferable to watching it lock up or crash. And you can try the whole thing out today using Adobe's 30-day trial. The tricky bit comes on Day 31 figuring out how to pay for it.

I suppose books are sort of the ultimate soft-sell. We print them and then we just, you know, put them on a shelf. They don't bleep or flash. We don't hand out samples of them on street corners. We wait for the reader to get a bus into town and hunt through the racks until they find one they like. Compare that with, say, cold-calling. You interrupt someone during their dinner and try not to let them get a word in edgeways while you reel off your pitch at them. Popups and their Flash equivalents are a little bit the same too: they cover the webpage you're trying to read as a way of holding your attention hostage while they try to sell you something. What I don't really understand is, who goes for that sort of marketing? It must work or it would have died out by now. But isn't everyone as turned off by it as me?

Anyway, I've made it my policy not to take up any offer pitched to me, unsolicited, over the phone because I don't want to help sustain those tactics with my custom. I've also signed up for the <a href=""http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/tps/"">Telephone Preference Service</a>, which does help cut the number of cold-calls I get - except that I got tricked recently into triggering a fresh deluge of cold-calls. What happened was this: a 'market survey' company called me and they happened to catch me in a good mood. They wanted to ask me some questions that would 'take no more than five minutes' (untrue). Now it seemed to me that market surveys are a good thing. If I'm going to complain when companies misread their customers' wishes, maybe I should be prepared to contribute some feedback. So I answered some questions along the lines of 'would you consider switching energy provider if you found a cheaper alternative?' and 'would you consider using a comparison service if you were trying to find cheap double-glazing?'. Only afterwards did I realise that any time I said 'yes' I had apparently 'expressed interest' in having various companies contact me to offer their products. Sneaky. But of course I'm more determined than ever not to have these firms profit from their trickery. So who is it that ensures the high-pressure deceptive marketing pays off?","","","","","2010-05-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

Last night's Doctor Who. My verdict. Meh.
<em>
Update</em>: I've got two other things to say but one is tangential and dull and the other is scurrilous.","<br/><br/><br/>
First off, to kind of address Wayne's question in the comments, take a look at this picture:
<img alt=""MSCloseUp.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/MSCloseUp.jpg"" width=""298"" height=""272"" />

Now ignore the colours because it's very artificial lighting. And the unflattering angle. What caught my eye were the dark areas under Mr Smith's eyes and the depth of the lines. He's twenty-seven. He does not look well to me. Of course I'm now no better than Heat Magazine for making wild speculations about celebrity health. I'm just saying he looks seriously peaky to me.

Now the reason I was looking at close-ups of Matt Smith leads me onto my second, and duller point. The Who team did a bit of shooting in the actual Venice for this episode and the rest was in the unspoilt Medieval town of Trogir in Croatia. Which was a surprise to me because I assumed from the dull skies and flat colours that the whole thing was filmed in some Welsh castle. So I took a look at the footage, and really, it wouldn't have been that difficult to brighten the whole thing up and remove the magenta tint that seemed to pervade the whole thing (and yes, I did calibrate my monitor before saying that). It just seemed such a waste to go all the way to Venice and Croatia and to bring back dull, overcast, flat footage with none of the sun and golden highlights we might have expected. And the problem of course is that they went in December. And December in Croatia recreates almost exactly the magical dullness of Cardiff light. The Christmas Specials suffer with that same six-month lead time: they're trying to shoot snow-covered, frosty externals in July. So it seems to me their choices are 1) shorten those lead times (bad idea; the show's scrappy enough without adding more time pressure) 2) lengthen them to nearly a year (which would be great if they spent the extra time on pickups to fix the stories and color-timing to fix the lighting*, etc;) or 3) just accept that we're so used to American shows giving us Christmas in June that we really don't care, especially on an escapist show based around a time machine.

*If you have enough time, you can do 'color-timing' (i.e. fix the lighting and colouring of footage) to a Hollywood standard with just a good home computer and a couple of hundred pounds worth of software. And it really makes a difference.","","","","2010-05-09","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

The thing I love most about good design is that it usually doesn't cost any more than bad design (particularly true when it comes to printed layouts). That's to say you can often have something that works well for the same price as something which works badly. And of course things that work well are more likely to become commercial successes - so there's even an incentive to aim for perfection. But we're all busy people, so we invented the concept of 'good enough' so as not to spend all day tinkering with the design of our till receipts. Or, in the design case I was just reading about, our boarding passes. Top left is the real boarding pass; bottom right is one suggested redesign produced by an unimpressed traveller. Click on either of them to see the full-sized version. There's a rather sweary, but amusing page about the whole thing <a href=""http://passfail.squarespace.com/"">here</a>. And in the comments, loads of other people have taken a crack at a redesign. (Now, despite having more pressing things to think about, my brain keeps trying to come up with new layouts. I'm not going to let it, though. )

And while I'm on the subject of design, I was just reading about the new version of Ubunti Linux. It doesn't really matter if 'Ubuntu Linux' is just a bunch of syllables which convey no meaning to you, because you don't need to know about software to appreciate the point. Which is, as part of a move to convince more people to use Ubuntu instead of Windows or Mac OSX, there's been an ongoing design project called '<a href=""http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/06/canonical-to-boost-ubuntu-usability-by-tackling-papercuts.ars"">Papercuts</a>'. And when I explain that 'Papercuts' is about fixing tiny design niggles in the user interface which otherwise might not be considered a priority, you can see how well-named it is.

Something I noticed a while back about the way people interact with shops - and it's also true about the way they relate to computers - is that the negatives count for more than the positives. Ten good experiences can be more than wiped out by one bad experience. Which is why a project like 'Papercuts' is so sensible. Before trying to come up with the next big thing, first make sure you're not screwing up all the good stuff you've done so far with silly, avoidable, niggly mistakes which become all your users notice or talk about. Death by a hundred papercuts.","","","","","2010-05-11","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

The more I hear about <s>home-taping</s> downloading killing music, the more I wonder who decided that recording musicians then charging others to listen would be a good permanent basis for a business empire. It's always been a tricky thing to insert oneself in the middle between musician and fan. In the olden days, the best you could have done was get the musicians working for you and then lock the door to anyone who wouldn't pay to come in and listen. That model will probably never go away. But for a while, when physical disks (records and CDs) were the commonest way to hear a tune, it got easy to charge for recordings. Now it's more difficult again. But don't take my word for it, listen to Mick Jagger's wise words on the subject:
<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">Jagger: Well, it's all changed in the last couple of years. We've gone through a period where everyone downloaded everything for nothing and we've gone into a grey period it's much easier to pay for things - assuming you've got any money.</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: dimgray;"">BBC: Are you quite relaxed about it?</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">Jagger: I am quite relaxed about it. But, you know, it is a massive change and it does alter the fact that people don't make as much money out of records. But I have a take on that - people only made money out of records for a very, very small time. When The Rolling Stones started out, we didn't make any money out of records because record companies wouldn't pay you! They didn't pay anyone!</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">Then, there was a small period from 1970 to 1997, where people did get paid, and they got paid very handsomely and everyone made money. But now that period has gone. So if you look at the history of recorded music from 1900 to now, there was a 25 year period where artists did very well, but the rest of the time they didn't.</span>

My verdict (for what it's worth) on this week's Doctor Who episode, <em>Amy's Choice</em>:
""Yay!""

One or two additional [spoilery!] thoughts...","I was pretty caught up in this episode. Intellectually it was great because you were trying to solve the puzzle, process the clues and figure out what the real rules were. What I found strange (but good) was that it was also very emotionally involving. The thing is, I don't really understand why.

Any good screenwriter will tell you that you need 'jeopardy' in your drama. The characters have to be in danger of losing something so that the tension or conflict in the story (which you should also remember to include) has some consequences. But that's a rather banal statement when applied to Who, because in most episodes everyone's lives are at stake - plus sometimes the whole planet - plus sometimes the entire universe. The thing, is that millions can be imperilled, including the regular cast, and I might not care. On this occasion, the stakes were much lower than usual: even if they just took a guess, there was a fifty percent chance of the principals surviving (or so we initially thought) and yet it was <em>exciting</em> in a way that (ho-hum) the universe might end often isn't. What I can't work out is: what clever thing was Simon Nye (the writer) doing that, say, Toby Whithouse wasn't doing last week. Any suggestions, all you writing experts out there? I want to say the acting was just better - because I think it was (Matt Smith's even!) - but I'm certain that the writing made the real difference and I really want to understand how.

My slight niggles with the ep involved some pacing here and there. I'd have liked a little more time and a little more emphasis given to the revelation that the Dream Lord was the Doctor and how the psychic pollen was behind it all. I actually found the idea that the Dream Lord wasn't real to be a slight anti-climax, because he was such a great villain (played so brilliantly by Toby Jones). So rather than a throwaway explanation, I would have preferred his non-existence to be part of solving the riddle of what was going on. Discover that he wasn't real in order to banish him. Then I might have felt a bit more triumphant about being deprived of such a wonderful character. But that's probably nit-picking. I might have also liked Rory's death scene to have been rejigged a little. Karen Gillan is badly lit and has only a few seconds to register her sorrow at Rory's demise. It didn't feel quite like the pivotal moment for the season that it was.
<img alt=""RorysDeath.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/RorysDeath.jpg"" width=""450"" height=""255"" />
Why light the chest of drawers and the wall but not Karen Gillan's face? Why stay wide when we're supposed to be registering her surprise and pain?

(And it might have been nice if the Doctor and Amy killing themselves had looked more deadly. Their camper van looked to be doing seven miles per hour when it hit the cottage. I reckon they were looking a broken headlight rather than death.)

But how brilliant was the plot? Choosing between two realities was a great idea. But making those realities represent not only Amy's two choices for her future but the two men in her life was inspired. It meant that all the detective work in analysing the two realities was also laden with emotional significance for all of them. I'd read that Simon Nye was great with character minutiae and dialogue, so I was expecting a slow-moving but poignant episode. The poignancy was there, but it was strapped to a rocket. I think this was as exciting as The Time Of Angels and hopefully it was made for a fraction of the cost. The locations were the Tardis set plus a muddy playground and a country cottage. The extras were pensioners. I like to think that in terms of excitement per pound spent, Amy's Choice set some sort of record.

<em>Update</em>: I recently read that this was the last episode to be filmed (despite being written as the midpoint) so it's possible the acting really was more bedded-in and practiced, so maybe that helped make the whole thing work.","","","","2010-05-16","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Just watching <em>The Genius of Design</em> on the BBC. I missed the first ep (though iPlayer will catch me up when I get a minute) but I'm enjoying episode two: <em>Designs for Living</em>. Fascinating to see that all modern fitted kitchens are descended, in design terms, from the <em>Frankfurt Kitchen</em> of Margarete Schtte-Lihotzky. And that minimalist apartments were more or less invented by Le Corbusier and his pals. But what's equally striking to me is how rubbish both of those inspired and original designs are.","Their designers set out to be utterly original and ruthlessly ground-breaking - nothing was sacred - and they still went nowhere near far enough. For all the talk of 'machines for living', these designs seem almost rustic in their lack of efficiency and precision. At the time of their conception, they must have been shocking. They were so different from anything domestic that had gone before. But from a modern perspective, an off-the-shelf IKEA kitchen would trounce Le Corbusier at every turn. Perhaps that's partly because of the politics of design, whereby designs are statements for others to talk about and signposts that show the way. Their creators perhaps didn't care that they weren't really 'finished'. But perhaps it's more that when you're so far out in front of anyone else, there's less incentive to keep going, to keep finessing and purifying your design - until the world at least begins to catch up. 

But I'm hoping this series will show me at least one designer who not only broke the mould but also charged off over the horizon with their ideas and didn't stop until they'd got something not only radical but thoroughly well-designed, because those are the examples we need in the real world. That's to say, not just ideas for a new sort of business, but an actual commercially-viable, new sort of business. Not just a sketch for a hydrogen-powered car, but a working, reliable car. And not just a prototype for a minimalist smartphone with a touchscreen, but a production version that's eminently usable too. And as you can tell from that last example, that's what impresses me about Apple: that their design process doesn't stop when they've broken the mould; it continues until their iconoclasm is also practical. I'm hoping to see a few forerunners of that approach.

<hr/>

Update: Now that I've finished watching that episode, I can see that the commercialisation of design tends to have that 'finishing off' effect I was talking about. Particularly impressive is the backyard designer and artisan (not to mention ex-shepherd) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Byam"">Wally Byam</a> with his Airstream Trailer.

You know, I find of enjoyed last night's Who. It was a little humourless and there was nothing particularly clever about it, but still I found myself having fun. I've thought in the past that the writer, Chris Chibnall, should be under house-arrest for crimes against television. He was the show-runner for Torchwood and wrote a number of episodes for them. Really, that should result in an automatic five-year ban from media work. But his first Who episode, <em>42</em>, was in the 'fairly good' category and that's probably where I'd put last night's effort, <em>The Hungry Earth</em>. I can't quite judge the pacing of last night's episode because I got a phone call in the middle of it. (Why would anyone call me at home at 18:45 on a Saturday? Unless they were my mother, I mean, and had a question about furniture.) But I'm hoping next week's ep can keep up the pace without doing anything too foolish.  [Continue reading for one or two spoiler-laden irrelevancies]","Was interested to hear on Who Confidential that Chris Chibnall's original idea for the main monsters in <em>The Deadly Earth</em> was giant lizards that curl themselves into a wheel shape and roll after people in order to attack them. If they'd gone down that route, I wonder at what stage they'd have realised that CC almost certainly 'came up with' that idea through the clever trick of simply seeing it on another show and nicking it (or perhaps assuming it got into his brain via 'imagination' rather than the more pedestrian 'memory'). c.f. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_lizard"">cluster lizards</a> from weird, Euro-Sci-Fi show <em>Lexx</em> - which I think people only ever watched very late at night, so I can almost understand how someone might think they dreamed it.","","","","2010-05-23","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Well, frankly I'm at a loss to explain it, but for whatever reason I've rather enjoyed this recent Dr Who two-parter. I even (brace yourselves) <em>even</em> found myself thinking Matt Smith was doing a good job on a couple of occasions. Small things, like there were a couple of jokes that I felt he delivered with a flourish rather than stepped on. And big things, like when he was supposed to be feeling a particular emotion I (gasp) quite often got a sense that he actually was. Really, I don't approve of burning through most of a season before you begin to find your feet, but this double ep was the first time I didn't find myself hoping they'd replace MS for 2011. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say that he'd finally managed to conjure up a little gravitas (presumably not easy for someone in their mid-twenties). And while there were all sorts of things wrong with the story - emotionally, logically and dramatically - the whole wheezing contraption still somehow swept me along with it. I suspect I might be in the minority with that reaction but I'd rather it was this way round than be left out in the cold. [keep reading for more spoilery thoughts]","I have to say I won't miss Rory. He was amusing as a character, but it was difficult to root for him. As a partner for Amy he was so openly insecure and suspicious. As a member of the team he was the one who always seemed to be saying 'hold on, I don't understand' or who'd be grumping because either the Doctor or Amy was doing something heroic. And as for his practical skills, there's comedy fighting to add to his yet-to-be-demonstrated-and-now-never-will-be nursing know-how. He tells Tony Mack he can help, but only has time to dab once at his infected green veins before he's distracted. And maybe three seconds after telling Alaya that she won't die because he'll save her, she dies. Plus he's spokesman for humanity for all of about ten seconds, in which time he's basically just confused. And did he save the Doctor or just get himself killed? I suppose it was the former, but I could never quite believe that Amy, who's chock-full of daring and humour, intelligence and confidence would plan to spend the rest of her life with someone so timid and disapproving. Which undercuts his loss rather. If instead of joking about it, they'd actually made Rory into Amy's nervous brother who she promised to keep out of trouble, I think I'd be rather sad about his loss. But still, no one deserves to be erased from history and have their fianc&eacute;e forgot they were ever there.

Nice touch, though, having a scorched lump from the Tardis as a clue for what's going on with the crack in time. Presumably the reason that the crack pops up everywhere our heroes (and their transport) do is that they're somehow involved with its creation. I hope the Doctor isn't reduced to travelling on foot after this season. Plus, with the continued references to unseen parts of the Tardis (the library, the sick-bay, the swimming pool, the kettle) I hope we'll get a glimpse of some of that soon. I've been waiting to see more of the Tardis since 1976 when the Doctor switched to using the alternate control room for a while (before then I'd assumed the Tardis was all one room, rather than a vast and intriguing labyrinth).","","","","2010-05-31","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I've said it before, but I don't like reading hardback editions of books, for the most part. They're too big, heavy and unwieldy compared with paperbacks. But of course many big publishers will only let you have the hardback for the first six months or so of a new book's life. I assume other justifications are sometimes offered (such as the supposed preferences of reviewers) but I see it as a way of charging more money from those readers prepared to pay more, before the paperback edition comes along to mop up the remaining demand at a lower price. And some will say that the hardback is a toe in the water before committing to a paperback release which might not be viable, but that makes very little sense to me. If you suspect the book won't sell, keep your costs down with a paperback-only release. But, if you refuse to publish the paperback simultaneously and you absolutely must attempt to fleece the public with an exclusive premium edition which precedes the paperback copy, why not offer an elite 'travel' edition, with higher-quality paper stock, some sort of softback cover and perhaps a gimmick like rounded corners. That way I'd be able to read it in comfort and pop it into a bag to take with me. Pretty please.","","","","","2010-05-31","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

If this was a scene from a sci-fi movie then mentally I'd be tutting at how ridiculous it was. Giant holes opening up suddenly in the ground and swallowing people? It sounds like something out of Doctor Who. Well, we should all be glad we don't live on the storm-sodden ground of Guatemala City.

So, the great Richard Curtis tries his hand at a Doctor Who script. When they first came up with that, it must have seemed like a really interesting idea. Less so now.

[spoilery thoughts for those who continue reading. And an attempt at some 'script doctoring' if you scroll down.]
<br/>","I'm guessing there's always going to be this problem when you introduce a Famous Figure from History into Doctor Who. Either they've got to be oblivious to the sci-fi going on around them - in which case they seem irrelevant and obtuse - or they are aware of it, and you find yourself with a second choice. Do you stay true to their historic persona and merely have them gawp and gasp at the sci-fi - which again makes them window-dressing rather than part of the drama - or do you have them somehow dive in among the weirdness and help with the action? I think the story demands that you choose the latter for the most part; you just have to hope that you can find something in the Famous Figure's dossier you can expand on so that they seem like a credible temporary companion (or adversary) of the Doctor. Charles Dickens's fascination with the supernatural was perhaps one of the more successful attempts. I rather think Vincent Van Gogh's ability to hit invisible aliens with a chair was more of a low point.

And sadly, Mr Curtis either wasn't able or didn't try to link the story of the rampaging alien to all the talk of Van Gogh's depression, madness, legacy or creative output. So, remarkably, we're left to assume that fighting and killing an alien monster - and then regretting that killing - had no particular influence on Van Gogh one way or the other in terms of artistic output or imminent suicide. Tut tut. Failing to link the A and B stories at all means that the episode as a whole doesn't add up to much. And for a bit more resonance, the plight of the monster and the plight of Vincent should been linked as well - otherwise what purpose is the monster serving, beyond providing some boilerplate jeopardy? Van Gogh's experiences with madness, loneliness and obscurity - or perhaps his perspective as an artist - should have held the key to either eliminating or rehabilitating the monster. He could even have made some remark about how conquering external demons is easy compared to the inner ones. That way his travails with depression could have been what gave him the courage to save the town, which would have given some purpose to his torments. Without those links, or something like them, the story doesn't tie together very well. There's lots of art history and scenes of madness vying for screen time with a fight against a giant, invisible parrot. And (as Simon Pegg <a href=""http://twitter.com/simonpegg/status/15505349787"">tweeted</a>, there's also an abundance of hugging.)

Mr Curtis didn't even play to his strengths and bung in some comedy (rubbish fighting has already been done this season and so doesn't count) or a romance. And even his regular standby, lots of swearing, was (perforce) missing. That must have really cramped his style, trying to write curse-free dialogue. No wonder it seemed a bit stilted in places.

One final note: I continue to find myself gradually warming to Matt Smith. He's still not a commanding presence, but I'm finding him rather endearing. His frantic, self-absorbed thrashing from the early episodes seems to have settled down into rather sweet bumbling - and I'm laughing at the jokes he delivers now. (Karen Gillan continues to be top value throughout, in my view.) 

<hr/><hr/>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">Updated:</span> Since there've been some really interesting and thoughtful comments on this story and its structure, I thought we could play a fun game of 'script doctoring'. I thought I'd have a go at a rewrite, at least in summary form. I'm claiming this is vaguely relevant to the SnowBlog because many of us will either write, publish or whinge about stories with roughly the same composition as a Doctor Who episode (even if it's in a different genre). So here goes.

Starting from the end (as I always do with thrillers) I think it's a pity that we begin with x number of Van Gogh's paintings in the Mus&eacute;e D'Orsay and end with the same number. So let's start with a bit more excitement and intrigue. The Doctor and Amy are looking around the museum and they come across a lone painting by Van Gogh, of a church. Bill Nighy's curator is saying that this is the only painting this enigmatic artist ever painted before his long history of depression turned to full-blown insanity... and then he was hanged for murder. Being time travellers, The Doctor and Amy (D&A) have an outside perspective and both know that history has been rewritten. Then they notice an alien monster drawn in the window of the church. ""Well he <em>was</em> mad,"" says Amy, by way of explanation. ""Yes,"" the Doctor agrees, ""True. So how come I recognise the alien he's drawn?"" And so it's off to nineteenth century France. Roll credits.

D&A arrive after dark and make enquiries about Vincent. We get a little background about what everyone thinks of his behaviour and his paintings. Someone points them towards his house, but on the way there, they hear screaming. Rushing to the scene of a murder, they find a wild-eyed Vincent being restrained by the constabulary and ranting about 'the beast' that's responsible. The victim's family arrive and accuse Vincent of being the beast himself because he was there at the scene of another recent murder too. Vincent is incarcerated. Meanwhile the Doctor isn't so sure. He's heard rumours that the creature Vincent drew can make itself invisible as a defence mechanism. So D&A creep into the spooky town mortuary later that night to examine the body. But something is in there with them. After a few tense minutes it turns out to be the night watchman, who they evade - after confirming that a Krafayis is much more likely to be responsible for the victim's wounds than Vincent.

The Doctor thinks there's something wrong with the normally-peaceful Krafayis that's making it kill. Perhaps it's a rogue. He's also concerned that it will kill again. And Vincent is the only one who can see it, so they need him. Bluffing their way into the jail, D&A talk to a very sad Vincent through the bars, asking for his help. They explain that the monster is real and not a sign of Vincent having gone off the deep end. And only Vincent can stop it before it kills again. While Vincent is relieved to find he's not totally delusional, he points out that if the monster kills while he's in jail, he's off the hook. And since everyone in town makes his life unbearable, what's his incentive to help them? The Doctor surreptitiously sonics the cell door open and Amy pleads with Vincent to slip out with them, but Vincent calls out to the warder telling him about the door. He's made his decision.

D&A give up and switch to Plan B. The Doctor spends the rest of the day rigging up something that can track the Krafayis and once it's dark they start hunting it, carrying a hypodermic that should sedate the creature if they can get close enough. After a couple of run-ins where the dangers inherent in trying to sedate an enraged and invisible alien are apparent, they follow it to... the alleyway at the side of the jail. D&A guess that the creature must have a reason for following Vincent, but can't work out what it is. As the creature starts to tear at the external wall of Vincent's cell, the warder comes running out to investigate the commotion and watches - along with Vincent who peers out from his cell window - as the Doctor tries to get the needle into the unseen beast. He is thrown aside and partly stunned, at which point Amy snatches up the hypodermic and makes an attempt to sedate it. But she is cornered and then pinned. We catch glimpses of the enraged creature as it prepares to gore Amy. 

But Vincent calls out to the Doctor to release him. The Doctor triggers the sonic screwdriver, choosing a powerful setting which unlocks every door in the vicinity, and moments later Vincent comes running out to confront the creature. His arrival distracts it from Amy and seems to calm it, and as Vincent slowly approaches it he explains that it is injured. He soothes the creature, and eventually gets close enough to lay his hands on it. The creature, as it calms, becomes visible and we can all see that it has a piece of metal protruding from its back. Having ascertained that it will only put the creature to sleep, Vincent asks for the hypodermic and keeps the creature calm while he injects it. The creature loses consciousness.

Now that the crisis has passed, Vincent and the warder eye each other: Vincent is after all an escaped prisoner. The Doctor turns to the warder and demands that he let Vincent go. The warder suggests they take the creature to the town square to display it, proving Vincent's innocence. Vincent objects: the townspeople will kill it. The Doctor agrees. The warder, an honest man, says the best he can do is to get a friend who owes him a favour to come forward as a witness to the first murder and say he saw the real murderer run off. It won't convince most of the townspeople but it will mean Vincent goes free.

It's the small hours, and D&A drag the sedated creature, wrapped in a tarpaulin, through the town towards the Tardis. They discuss how Vincent has saved the town at the expense of his own reputation. And what tipped the balance was compassion for a tormented creature. They conclude it followed Vincent because he was the only who could see it - and therefore help it - and that perhaps it felt some empathy with him too. 

We'll keep the scene where Vincent awakes to a garden full of sunflowers, thanks to Amy. The Doctor reassures him they've patched the creature up and returned it to its own kind. We'll also keep the scene where the Doctor tells Vincent that his unique way of looking at the world, and the way he turns his pain into beauty, is a rare gift. Vincent replies that by helping the town and the creature he's lost any chance of acceptance or recognition. There's no point in painting any more because no one will see his pictures. He hasn't the strength to go on and wants to burn what he has already painted.

D&A go into a huddle for a moment. Then the Doctor says he wants to offer Vincent a deal. If Vincent will promise to keep painting and to keep battling his inner demons for as long as he can bear to, the Doctor will give him a reason to go on. But he has to promise first for the deal to work. Amy pleads with him too and, touched, Vincent promises. The Doctor asks Amy for her cell-phone, tinkers with it for a bit, and then gives it to Vincent. He tells Vincent to press the green button when the phone rings.

That evening we see Vincent sitting by the fire when the phone rings - there's an incoming video call. Vincent answers it and the screen lights up showing the Doctor and Amy. They say 'hi' and pan their phone around to show that they're in Paris, at the Mus&eacute;e D'Orsay, in the twenty-first century. Then they go inside. We see on the screen as they reach the Van Gogh gallery: the crowds, all the paintings. Vincent is amazed. Then they corner Bill Nighy and have him give his speech about the importance of Van Gogh to the world. A tear rolls down Vincent's face as D&A sign off - with the Doctor reminding Vincent to toss the phone on the fire (which probably makes Amy cross). Vincent sits there profoundly moved and almost happy, staring at the phone, before finally casting it into the flames.

Now back to the museum. The phone call ended, Amy asks the curator when Van Gogh died. Disappointed with the answer, and the fact that he killed himself, Amy bemoans the realisation that all they bought him was one more year. The Doctor gestures all around them at the walls full of paintings and the grand hall they're in and says that maybe one year was enough. End credits.

There. So that's what I'd do. I think that knits the A and B stories, introduces a bit more excitement, links the monster's struggle in with Van Gogh's own, hopefully without being too OTT and keeps Richard Curtis's nice speeches and a few of his ideas.","","","","2010-06-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","7"

Hey, chaps! Look at this press release! Congrats to Paula, the genius author. 

Brecon Beacons author <a href=""http://www.mind.org.uk/news/3493_mind_awards_2010_nominees_announced"">shortlisted</a> for Mind Book of the Year Award

Brecon Beacons author and P.J.Davy has been shortlisted for Minds Book of the Year Award 2010 for her latest book Nutters. The national charity award, now in its 29th year, celebrates writing that contributes to a greater understanding of mental health issues in all their forms.

Bent on reinvention and tired of being labelled a loon, Nutters central character Rufus Waters decides to reject his mental health problems and instead choose sanity. P.J Davys unique comic novel takes take the reader through the fruitless, often hilarious efforts of Rufus to deny his true self. Throughout the book Davy tackles a serious subject in an entertaining manner, which achieves a book that is truly thought-provoking.  
 
Nutters is Davys first comic novel, and she is currently working on her second as well as a screenplay. She lives halfway up a Brecon Beacon with her partner and their two children.
                                                                                                           
P.J. Davys Nutters is among seven books that have been shortlisted by the Mind judges Blake Morrison, Fay Weldon and Michle Roberts, for the coveted prize. The winner will be announced on Thursday 8 July at the Mind Awards ceremony in central London.

One word for you: 'fun'. Or three words: 'slightly mindless fun'. It's funny (at least to me) how much less plot holes bother me if I'm having fun. They'd better not be so big that I fall down them, but I think they matter less if you're being carried along with the story. Any time you're forced to think analytically then the plot had better make sense. So that's 1) if it's a mystery (so they're making you think to entertain you) or 2) when you're trying to figure out what the hell's going on (so they're making you think because they've screwed up). But if you're along for the ride emotionally, you're clear on what's happening and you're interested in how it turns out, taking a few liberties with logic (or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity"">ret-con</a>*) doesn't seem so bad. It's like the difference between being unexpectedly asked to wash up after being cooked a nice meal or being unexpectedly asked to wash up instead of being cooked a nice meal.

And did you note the bit where the writer, Gareth Roberts, mentioned that initially the disappearances (=A story) and the romance (= B story) were separate, but then Steven Moffatt suggested having the resolution to one also be the resolution to the other. Which is exactly what we were talking about last week when it didn't happen. Maybe he didn't dare tell Bafta, Golden Globe and multiple Emmy award-winning Richard Curtis, CBE, the same thing. But maybe he should have done.

*Not that I care, but Amy had access to a Tardis database with the plans for every house in Colchester (the world? the universe?). And the second-storey couldn't have been a recent addition (so the database included the council planning permission files too)? The doctor happened to have an earpiece with him when he was ejected from the Tardis which could communicate back to Amy even with the Tardis in limbo? That would have been handy on lots of other occasions too, especially if his companion were given an earpiece as well. The Tardis materialised sufficiently for the Doctor to saunter out but, thereafter, not for him to jump back in? When Sophie screamed they could hear it downstairs but not when the other victims screamed? 

But, like I say, because everything else in the story was carrying its weight, I reckon the plot logic could afford to be creaky in a couple of places.","","","","2010-06-13","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

And you know I don't chuck exclamation marks around lightly! So, any aspiring TV screenwriters out there? Because I have a prize to give away.

I'm pretty interested in how the whole American TV industry functions, where screenwriting and showrunning are well-defined jobs with their own career path - which I don't think happens in the same way here in the UK. Writing takes place in 'the room', where episodes are 'broken' and there's a whole science to 'cold opens', 'act breaks' and 'teasers'. In my pontificating on the state of UK TV drama (especially in regard to shows like 'Doctor Who') I've often thought that importing a really seasoned US showrunner might help raise our game. We wouldn't need to slavishly follow their rules, but I think an ignorance of them is even worse. For a glimpse into what I'm talking about I happen to have a spare copy of a DVD called '<a href=""http://csorders.com/store/product56.html"">Breaking the Story</a>' in which <a href=""http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0591101/"">Tim Minear</a> takes an audience of trainee screenwriters through putting together the story for a hypothetical episode of <a href=""http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0162065/"">Angel</a> - the Buffy spin-off - for which Minear used to be the showrunner. The DVD is one of the shoddily shot, edited and packaged - but still rather fascinating - '<a href=""http://csorders.com/store/page3.html"">Expo Seminar</a>' DVDs from Creative Screenwriting Magazine in the States. (Their Joss Whedon <a href=""http://csorders.com/store/product52.html"">one</a> is wonderful, but I don't have a spare copy of that I'm afraid.)

I'm not sure how many of you out there are interested, but seeing as how I only have one spare copy, write a comment here if you're so inclined (making sure you fill in your e-mail address on the comment form - it won't appear next to your comment, though - it stays secret) and a week from now (if anyone has commented) I'll flip a coin and mail someone the disk.

There's a little nugget of publishing-related irony to be mined this week. And I'm always a fan of that sort of thing. So let me drop it into the assaying scales for you all to take a look at.

In theory, eBooks are a free-for-all - one big melting pot of downloadable reading - lovingly self-published novels rubbing shoulders with  corporate 'product' - everything on an equal footing and just a click away. 

But we've talked before about the unfortunate appearance of many self-published books. The annotated postcard of a cover image. The copier-paper interior. The 'typesetting'. The 'proofreading'. And in their electronic incarnations DIY novels are not much better. Only the incongruous paper choice has been done away with.

This week, however, I've been tinkering with an iPad. It only takes a few moments to load it up with Amazon's Kindle software to complement Apple's iBooks app. And I added in Kobo's reader as well, because the Internet said to, though I haven't worked out why yet. 

Having assembled too much IKEA furniture this week, I was resting my slightly painful back and I thought of a new book that I'd like to read. And - wonder of the age! - less than a minute later it had been found, purchased and delivered to my iPad. It's not a fabulous reading experience, but it's not hard work either. Paper is clear to read in all lights, but the iPad works fine in the dark. It's a little more unwieldy than a paperback and a little less so than a hardback. For reading, a shiny screen isn't ideal, but then again it has a trick a book can't do. I like being able to lie in bed, with the iPad laying edgewise on the pillow, supporting its own weight, and being able to flip to the next page without moving more than a thumb. When in bed with a paperback, reading whichever page is lowermost is easy. But reading the uppermost page means holding the book propped fully open or turning myself over alternately with each page or some such mucking around. Otherwise I'm using more arm muscles than I want to just before turning out the light.

But the thing I noticed - the ironic thing - is that eBooks have turned out to be egalitiarian in an unexpected way. Even the high-profile titles from the big publishing houses look horrible.","Quotations are in the same font as the body text, and their placement is wonky. Foreign characters are rendered very eccentrically. And the whole thing looks in need of some serious professional attention. Most of the formatting we'd expect has evaporated. And I'm talking titles straight off the New York Times Bestseller's list here. Granted, I was using the Kindle software, so perhaps Kobo and iBooks versions are better, but as you can imagine, Amazon is where all the books are at the moment. The Kindle store is huge and easy to use. And every novel you buy from there looks self-published. The future has arrived.

(There's one other little kink I experienced. Each new technology brings new ways for things to break. VHS tapes rarely skipped or froze. Unlike DVDs. And before now, I've never been charged in a book shop for a book I didn't want. Somehow, while buying Clay Shirky's new book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cognitive-Surplus-Creativity-Generosity-Connected/dp/1594202532/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1276879227&sr=8-2"">Cognitive Surplus</a>, I was charged for his first book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Here-Comes-Everybody-Happens-Together/dp/0141030623/ref=pd_sim_b_6"">Here Comes Everybody</a>. I wouldn't mind but I've already got a paper copy and I've read it. Amazon followed through and delivered the unwanted electronic copy to my iPad, but I could find no way of 'returning' it the way I would a physical item shipped by mistake. On the other hand, all you nay-sayers might like to consider the fact that if I drop my iPad in the bath, my books are all safe - ready to be downloaded afresh - and ready to open to the very page I was on. I'd merely need to shell out another 500 for a new iPad and I'd be back in business.)","","","","2010-06-18","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Well, not so much an episode as 45 minutes of setup for next week. But I wasn't bored. [spoilers ahead]","It was kind of a giant horse-pill of plot to swallow this week. Somehow everyone but the Doctor knows there's a universe-wide catastrophe in progress and that he caused it (but perhaps the <em>how</em> of that knowledge will be explained later). It's set in the past so most of these races haven't met the Doctor yet, so are they all time-travelling back to Roman times? Somehow? Where does that leave the uniqueness of Time Lords - and the safety of the rest of us - if every advanced race can transport armadas through time? I'm assuming even <em>sans</em> real Romans the doctor isn't wrong about the time period he thinks he's in. (But perhaps all that will be explained later.) And, biggest plot point to swallow of the lot: all the Doctor's enemies are working together to create a Baroqueishly elaborate ruse to capture, but not kill, him. (I'm thinking we're just supposed to accept that and there'll be no clever explanation later.) It's all a bit much, but in its defence it has led us to quite a dramatic, Han Solo-style cliffhanger. 

I had a giddy thought as the words 'To Be Continued' appeared and I muttered to myself 'it had better be'. For a moment I imagined the announcer saying 'And that was the last ever episode of Doctor Who.' Just as a wind-up. Followed by: 'I'm sorry. I meant to say, tune in next week for the concluding part of this story.'

A point I wanted to make about jeopardy: it doesn't need to be bigger and more terrible than ever before. It simply has to be something you care about. In fact making it personal and smaller can make it easier to get your head around. There really is no need to imperil not just this universe, but all other universes, not just now but for all time, ever, in order to raise the stakes on all previous seasons' finales. There's isn't even a need to have everyone on Earth at risk. I think we could gain a bit of poignancy if the jeopardy arms race was halted and what was at risk was something more personal. To choose something at random: Amy having to live out her life on some miserable alien world. Or the Doctor losing all his childhood memories. Actually that last one's a good one: imagine if the Doctor didn't know where he came from. He'd have a hell of a job finding out. Which is not to say the story itself - the resolution of that jeopardy - shouldn't possess breadth and grandeur. It's the jeopardy itself that needs to be personal rather than (or as well as) epic and I feel it's all in danger of getting a bit silly. There is no possible way next season can top the last two. We've already imperilled all of space this season and all of time last season. For the finale next year I think they should aim for poignancy and not scale. To bastardise a phrase: 'feel locally, but act globally' if you will.","","","","2010-06-20","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","10"

Well, I very much enjoyed that. 
[spoilers ahead]","For any budding screenwriters out there, Doctor Who Confidential provided one or two little tidbits of good info, courtesy of Steven Moffat. In a story riddled with out-of-sequence appearances by the Doctor you need a way to keep straight what's going on and, more fundamentally, to help the viewer understand the basic concept. You could add in another five minutes of explanations (=bad) or you could do it visually - and therefore subliminally/instinctively - with the simple addition of a fez and a mop. Very nice: it works, it only costs thruppence and it's suddenly more than paying for itself by generating all sorts of comedy moments that really enhanced the episode. In fact my feeling is that whenever you feel you're spending too long on exposition, or you're fretting that your audience won't follow your basic premise, there's always a more straightforward, more visual way to get the job done.

(The mop-and-fez approach is actually part of a broader screenwriting trope that gives you lots of minor characters with weird names or one eye or some other exotic feature because they're going to crop up later and the audience needs to remember them. And if that trope doesn't already have a name, I'm going to propose the 'Fezmop'. Verb = 'to fezmop'.)

Mr Moffat also expanded upon the gimmick of the Fezmop, claiming that the way to sell a very complicated idea is to let the audience get there first when it comes to figuring out what's going on. I don't think I necessarily buy that. I'd substitute a broader point, which is that when it comes to solving on-screen mysteries - including those mysteries where the plot itself is the thing you're intentionally being asked to make sense of - you have to judge the difficulty of the puzzle so that the on-screen resolution arrives in roughly the same time-frame as the audience working it out for themselves. Personally I would say that a lot of the time you want the story on-screen to get there first, so that it seems brilliant and unexpected, but the audience have to be halfway there already so that when they're shown the answer to the riddle they comprehend it and it clicks into place in a satisfying way.

In fact, as a general rule, I'd say that on-screen mysteries must seem totally unexpected and simultaneously obvious with hindsight. The 'obvious with hindsight' part is important. It's why Twelve Angry Men is a brilliant film: because the audience have all the clues they need, they just don't realise it until the story reveals it. And it's why mumbling a bit of technobabble is a bad way to resolve a plot point: it should be something the audience <em>could</em> have guessed even though they didn't. Otherwise it's nowhere near as satisfying to watch.

This week there were plotholes, but by and large, this week's plotholes turned out to be there for a reason. Some formed important 'reveals' later on in the story - for instance I was fretting over why the death of *all* stars didn't involve our sun - did Moffat not know that our sun is a star like any other - but I needn't have worried. While other plotholes became cliffhangers: how did the Tardis come to explode? Tune in next season.

I'm still wondering whether the answer to that last question will also tackle a couple of last week's niggles: how come all the Doctor's psychopathic, murderous enemies can come together as a cooperative team? And can all the evil races of the galaxy jump through time at will now? But possibly by the time those questions have been answered I won't care so much. And I'm sticking with what I said a few weeks ago: provided, as a viewer, you understand a story emotionally and the overall shape makes sense, purely logical niggles are less of a worry. It's only when we cling to the logic of a story because we're no longer following it intuitively on an emotional level that those niggles become major frustrations. The exception to that rule being any time a series contradicts itself: like when a story relies on an idea in order to move the plot along but later ignores that idea when it's inconvenient. It happens all the time in TV but it jars with the viewer because relying on an idea to solve a plot point is a way of telling the audience that it's important and might crop up again in the future, so remember it. Discarding the rule later is a little like stalling your car: it makes it clear to anyone watching that there's a novice at the wheel.

Not entirely sure what to do with my early Saturday nights for the next ten months or so. But the idea that makes the most sense is probably to do some screenwriting.","","","","2010-06-27","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","9"

So I've been busy reading books via the Kindle software on my iPad for a couple of weeks now. And while it's not perfect, I don't see it being any sort of problem either. I read heaps of text-only non-fiction (the sort of titles that you'd buy in paperback) so I'm not referring to picture-rich coffee-table books here. But if I could only ever read paperback-style books this way, I don't think I'd mind - though I'd want them to do a <em>lot</em> better with the software. 

I mentioned this before, but I'm amazed at how rough around the edges the Kindle app is. This is 2010 after all. They've had years to get this right and Amazon are far and away the market leaders in selling ebooks. Apple have their own iBooks app but Amazon have nearly eight times as many titles (=450,000) so if you're at all eclectic in your reading habits (which I am) then Amazon is the only realistic option. It has the titles I want and they're a cinch to buy and download. The drawback is that everything looks it was just transferred straight over from Word, without being typeset first. 

Part of this is down to the iPad itself with its poor choice of fonts (<a href=""http://fontfeed.com/archives/ipad-typography/"">a problem</a> I linked to <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/04/invented_dtp_then_lost_way.html#more"">previously</a>). Part of it is down to the Kindle app and the way it handles things like justification. Its justification options guarantee every book looks awful. To get the spacing between words looking nice you either have to hyphenate (i.e. break a word over two lines) or you have to let the right-hand edge of the text be a bit ragged. Most Kindle books do neither, preferring to open huge gaps between the words in order to keep both margins straight.

Given the sci-fi-ness of the iPad and the level of mature design it exudes, it's a real blow to the electronic book market to have many people's first experience of an ebook look like it's running on software from the Nineties. Ebooks are capable of amazing things - touch a word to look it up in Wikipedia - add a soundtrack - embed interactive illustrations - you could even make books intelligent. I picture, for instance, a spotter's guide to trees and animals which asks you questions to help you identify which specimen you've just encountered and then takes you to the right chapter. The iPad has just introduced around three million people to ebooks and it will have done so rather badly.","","","","","2010-07-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

I haven't stepped into the mire lately by mentioning man-made climate change. Does it seem the subject has also gone a bit quiet recently in the media? Maybe it's the recent cool summers plus this latest cold winter that did it. Actually, on that subject I loved reading an explanation of why getting your short-term predictions wrong doesn't mean you're wrong about the long-term stuff. Basically you can be wrong about the little tricky things without being wrong about bigger, more obvious stuff. It's all about statistics. Picking which exact days will be hot is tricky, but saying that they're more likely to occur around June, July or August rather than, say, December, January or February is a lot easier. Specifics are weather, overall trends are climate. Several wet summers in a row doesn't mean that the concept of 'summer' has now been disproved.

I've also been reading up a bit on the those who think man-made climate change is a hoax - and the PR campaigns which push that idea. (They call it a 'hoax' because if you call it a 'conspiracy' you sound crazy.) As someone who believes the government routinely lies to us and makes terrible decisions in our name, I have nothing in principle against the idea of a climate hoax. But the idea that low-paid scientists are the bad guys, and the oil companies, energy companies and heavy industry are the innocent victims has me confused. Why would anyone believe that? Around 99% of climate scientists agree that man-made climate change is real and a threat to humanity. Whereas among non-climate-experts scepticism runs at around 50%. If it's a hoax, then who's running it because almost everyone with money or power is on the opposite side. The idea seems to be that by falsifying their conclusions and scaring the rest of us, climate scientists get bigger grants. Whereas, in reality, the opposite is true. The handful of scientists who say man-made climate change doesn't exist tend to find it easy to get sponsorship from private industry think-tanks.","For me, it either comes down to the idea that climate scientists are wrong or that they're lying. If they're wrong, then only other climate scientists will know - people like Bjorn Lombord, the 'Skeptical Environmentalist', with his degrees in political science, aren't going to be able to spot the flaws in the mind-bogglingly complex models. And if they're lying then it's a lie that's perpetuated daily by thousands of low-paid researchers all over the world who have all decided to turn every day of their working lives into an elaborate pantomime where they all pretend to be collaborating on research that they're all secretly fabricating. If there's a hoax here, it makes vastly more sense that it's on the other side, with a few oil companies and their allies spreading as much doubt as they can on a question that's already settled by those who know what they're talking about. And in the meantime, governments talk a lot and hope like hell they don't have to do anything yet.","","","","2010-07-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

I mentioned in part I how amazing ebooks have the potential to become. Maybe you've played with the extraordinary interactive encyclopedia, The Elements, from <a href=""http://touchpress.com/"">Touch Press</a>. Or you've read Alice in Wonderland in iBooks on the iPad, with its moving pictures and shake-able figures. For the novel, the possibilities are interesting, if not earth-shattering, but for the non-fiction book the sky is the limit. Imagine textbooks with test questions after each section. A medium score might trigger a little more explanation, a high score might take you onto the next topic and a terrible score might jump you to some remedial foundation reading. What's more, content could be updated and the tests could contain different questions each time you take them. And I'm picturing embedded video of experiments being performed while simultaneously a table of readings updates and a graph of data points gradually draws itself. <em>Now position the trend line where you think it should go. Touch here to reveal the correct line. Do you know why the line goes there? Touch the answer you think makes most sense from these three possibilities.</em>

Or picture a book about the history of The Beatles with video footage, a soundtrack and interactive elements such as timelines and discographies you can touch to take you to the relevant chapter. Perhaps the book itself reorganises itself based on your interests. A chapter on each member of the group or a chronological retelling of their shared story: you choose. Buy albums, order memorabilia, and check recent Beatles news without leaving the book.

Imagination, and the effort you're prepared to put in, would be the only constraints. Granted, these aren't traditional books we're talking about, but with so few people reading these days, doesn't education - including the ongoing general-knowledge reading that many of us do in our leisure time - need to drag itself out of the nineteenth century?

(And for the ultimate in ebooks - one that can raise our children for us - why not read The Diamond Age. Here's the Kindle store <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Diamond-Age-ebook/dp/B000FBJCKI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&m=A7B2F8DUJ88VZ&s=digital-text&qid=1278067711&sr=1-1"">link</a>.)

Like most publishers, our two biggest costs are wages and print costs (including returns). Wages are predictable, so they're not likely to suddenly sink the business, but print costs, especially the money that gets wasted when we get an unexpected surge in returns, is our biggest risk. It's a particularly nasty risk too because you can bank the cheque for sales, spend the money, and then many months down the line be told you need to give the money back - and pay a load more besides to your distributors to pulp stock you thought the retailers had already sold. If a publishing business dies suddenly, returns would be the prime suspect. (Granted, retailers are often to blame for this situation, but that doesn't make you any less bankrupt.)

And all that risk largely goes away if we're not maintaining physical inventory. Each additional sale of an ebook is pure profit - there are no incremental print costs - and returns are no longer a factor. Our business - if it dealt entirely with ebooks - would suddenly find that its risk profile had plummeted. And if a book really takes off you wouldn't have to agonise over whether to print a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand copies - knowing that a mistake, even with a blockbuster on your hands, could ruin you. With ebooks you can satisfy every potential sale no matter how unexpected and without betting the business on colossal print runs.

There's still the threat of unexpectedly low sales, but they're more of a risk right now, when fear of crippling returns or a warehouse full of unsold stock stops us pushing a book too hard. You'd still gamble your promotional budget in a world of ebooks, but your losses would never exceed what you spent - which isn't the case when physical returns suddenly spike. Ebooks look like taking a lot of the risk and most of the waste out of the publishing supply chain. Fewer trucks on motorways, fewer felled trees, no pulping - and any book available in seconds whenever you want it. It doesn't sound like a bad future to me.","","","","","2010-07-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","8"

Apparently Stephen King didn't realise he was an alcoholic until there was a garbage strike and all the bottles and cans he'd been getting through started to pile up. Being considerably less hardcore than Stephen King, my recent revelations are rather more twee and liberal, but nevertheless a little similar.

I recently decided to do more recycling and Step One was not throwing away things that looked like they could conceivably be deposited somewhere other than landfill. So I put aside bottles and jars and tubs and dispensers in glass and plastic and coated paper. And two very troubling things happened. Firstly, there turned out to be so much of it. A week's worth of packaging pretty much provided me with all the plastic bottles I thought I could ever reuse myself; so what about the other fifty-one weeks of the year? And secondly, a lot of it turned out not to be recyclable - at least not by my local council. And looking online there didn't seem to be anywhere else I could take these things.

I've even started to get familiar with the little recycling triangles with the numbers on that you see on plastics. I can locally recycle 1s and 2s, but nothing else. And I've been surprised to see that maybe a quarter of the packaging I buy still doesn't have those marks on it. Are they made of mysterious moon-plastic? Or are the manufacturers just lazy? If they can fit the maker's name on there I reckon they can manage a little number in a triangle. 

Anyway, picturing what the heap of rubbish - mainly packaging - little-old-me must have produced in his lifetime is guilt-inducing. Picturing what that heap would look like if you were to combine it with everyone else's from just, say, the UK... well, that's a mind-boggling and scary thought. I've even found myself looking for alternative brands of my favourite things but which come in packaging that I could recycle more easily and it hasn't been easy. Guilt has made me cut way down on eating and drinking some of the things I like, because once you line a few week's worth of bottles or tubs up on the counter the whole exercise starts to seem recklessly wasteful. I'm even beginning to think I'm going to have to learn to cook properly. Not because I have any interest in it at all, but so I can find a greengrocers, like my grandma used to use, and only have a few brown-paper bags left over once I've eaten my fruit and veg. (And I think I'll try to find somewhere that doesn't fly in half the produce from the other side of the world.) I know this is a clich&eacute;, and not a very interesting one either, but when you think about the vats of oil that get used up making indestructible packaging for something that only lasts a week, it really is difficult to imagine we can all do this for much longer.","","","","","2010-07-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

After the downer of the last post, let me make it up to you slightly. As you may know, I like clever design. I like <em>practical</em> clever design especially. But I think I like the idea of C2C design best of all. In case you don't know, there's an idea called <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cradle_to_Cradle_Design"">Cradle To Crade</a> (as contrasted with conventional design which is cradle-to-grave - or mine-to-landfill if you prefer). C2C thinking involves making products out of materials that can be reused forever more. The idea separates the world into two cycles, the Biological and the Technical. An apple is biological. You throw whatever you don't eat on the ground and it gets perfectly recycled (provided we don't, say, seal it in a plastic bin bag). A technical product is pretty much anything we make or anything that the biological world can't process back down to raw materials. The technical cycle needs to work the same way as the biological cycle. We need to be able to pull our products apart and separate out the raw materials to a level of purity that's indistinguishable from what we started with. Biologicals get returned to the earth, technical materials are turned back into raw ingredients. Currently we're very good at mixing plastics or metals together and then bonding them to something else. Just getting the labels off packaging can be tricky because at the moment no one seems much bothered what happens to those materials once they're thrown away. But if they were the raw ingredients for the next cycle of manufacturing there'd be enormous incentive to make everything reclaimable. The founders of Cradle To Cradle, McDonough and Braungart, wrote <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cradle-Michael-Braungart/dp/0099535475/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1278963614&sr=8-1"">a book</a> about their ideas. It wouldn't be an easy thing to implement, but sooner or later it'll be cheaper for manufacturers to get their raw plastics from the piles of plastic refuse on all sides than to dig more oil out of the ground to make fresh plastic. Likewise with rubber and glass and concrete and steel. If all our industries are based on digging stuff out of the ground and then burying it a little later, we'll run out of planet. But if we make things so that they can be taken apart and made into something else - indefinitely - our way of life could actually look very similar to how it is right now, only it would be sustainable. Closed biological and technical cycles, replenishing themselves forever - new products every year without using anything up - just add energy and ingenuity.","","","","","2010-07-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/sep/05/death-books-rebirth-print"">Interesting article</a> in the Guardian about the gathering pace of e-book popularity. It almost looks like a major shift in buying patterns. But you're not fooled. This is just a flash in the pan. The medium is partly the message and novels are terribly diminished if they're being read with the latest technology. And what about the smell of books? Never forget that the old-fashioned, musty, elitist whiff of books is part of their appeal. And what if you dropped one in the bath or sat on it? (Not that you'll buy the technology even when it is indestructible and waterproof.) And these sales are probably all celebrity tattle-tales, self-help and ghost-written auto-biogs. Frankly if this is the future they can keep it. What's so great about being able to touch a word to see its meaning and etymology? Or carrying five hundred books in your pocket with another million available to buy in seconds? Books aren't meant to be self-illuminating in the dark or to turn their own pages. Why can't we all just accept that it's still the 1950s in certain parts of the book industry and stop all this change for change's sake? Mutter mutter make our own fun in those days mutter mutter national service never did anyone any harm mutter mutter country's gone to the dogs mutter.

This is pretty unacceptable. I <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/07/ebooks_part_i.html"">mentioned</a> that some of the Kindle books I've been buying to read on my iPad have had decidedly funky - and completely amateurish - formatting, despite being the output of blue chip publishers. Well, the other day I bought a technical book, complete with complicated text layouts, and the damn thing is almost unusable. Take a look at the two images lower down in this post. They're from two different versions of this book and they're samples of how to write Ruby software - that's what the book is about. In the properly formatted example (the first one) there are some comments over on the left and the code itself on the right. But look at the second version, the Kindle one. It jumbles the comments in with the example of how to write software. This book is supposed to be giving you your first glance at Ruby code and it's turned it almost into junk. You certainly couldn't get that code to run. And yet in the print version, it's all neatly arranged. So where did it all go wrong?

Seriously, I'm interested to know. Is this widespread, with the Kindle versions of textbooks being sold in the Amazon store while being unusable? Or can the Kindle format handle these sorts of layouts properly and it's just this particular publisher (and a few others I've been unlucky enough to encounter) that's screwed up?","Print version:

<u>Updated:</u>

The book in question was published by <a href=""http://nostarch.com/"">No Starch Press</a> who are distributed by O'Reilly (who, as Matthew points out in the comments, practically invented ebooks). I dropped them a line and they responded within 24 hours to say:
a) sorry
b) they were pulling the electronic version of the book immediately until it was fixed
c) they would fix it
d) in the meantime I could have a PDF of the book 
e) I could also have a discount of 30% off my next order for my trouble

I have to say I don't really see how they could have handled it better. And, fuelled by thoughts of a 30% discount on their already discounted e-books, I bought three of them that I probably otherwise wouldn't. As Em (who once did a project on this) will tell you: handling a complaint really well can often produce a loyal customer from a disgruntled one.

Well, here's a rum do. A lot of you may know that Emma and I have been putting in a lot of hours over at <a href=""http://www.onixcentral.com/"">Onix Central</a> this last eighteen months or so. Actually, it's mainly been Emma, in concert with Robin Tobin. Robin attends a lot of the publishing trade events and Emma's been bumping into him there for years. He used to work at <a href=""http://anko.ie/"">Anko</a> and was involved in their <a href=""http://www.editeur.org/83/Overview/"">Onix</a> software. Emma and I had also been doing a lot, in-house, with Onix and so it started to seem like a good idea to form a business together. We had lots of ideas, but the main one was to write a piece of software that was like a new and improved version of Anko's Publishing Manager. Since that fateful decision, we've had a lot of ups and downs, but none larger (and more down) than discovering that Robin Tobin is not who we thought he was.","Robin Tobin is his actual name, but almost everything else we thought we knew about him is wrong. For instance, he's been disappearing off to visit his two young daughters, Katie and Anouk, every week for as long as we've been working with him. Only he doesn't have two young daughters. Or if he does, they don't have the names, mothers and home addresses he says. We've also swapped e-mails with his eldest daughter, Liberty, and I've even lent her books. But she doesn't exist either. So presumably when we e-mail with her it's really Robin who replies.

The early days of Onix Central were a bit of a struggle because of an ongoing feud between Robin and his old firm, Anko. They were trying to sue him and had managed to get his accounts frozen. And sure enough, Emma and I would occasionally get e-mails from them accusing him, and by association us, of all sorts of things. Robin advised us never to respond: it might prejudice the court case he was preparing against them. When I discovered that almost everything else I thought I knew about Robin was wrong I got in touch with Anko. It turns out they never sued him and never froze his accounts. Robin's bank accounts weren't frozen; they were simply empty. He just didn't want us chatting to them because of what they could tell us about him, including that he'd caused them a lot of trouble before they'd managed to get rid of him.

Round about this time I started to remember all the ex-girlfriends of Robin's who he'd said were 'stalking' him, so I contacted one of them. And very rapidly I realised that she wasn't stalking him; she was trying to get him to leave her alone. From what I can gather, Robin has had two - sometimes even three - women believing, simultaneously, that he is about to marry them and thinking that when he's not with them he's travelling on business or is with his 'daughters'. Apparently, he adjusts his back-story, his likes and dislikes, and even his personality to please whomever he is trying to charm. And as a result he has left a trail of abandoned women who he has talked out of savings or previous relationships and into debt or pregnancy - and then he's threatened them with all sorts of retribution if they make trouble for him.

As best as we can figure out, Robin has been living like this for years now, probably around two decades: sponging off women who think he's the love of their life and persuading mugs like me that he's a hard-working entrepreneur. 

We're still in the process of unscrambling all this. For instance, Anko have very graciously agreed not to do anything about the fact that we have had a laptop of theirs for the last year: we thought it was Robin's and actually paid him for it. We have also been using Anko's software for years believing that we'd bought a licence from them only to discover that we'd bought a licence from Robin and Anko knew nothing about it. We owe Anko a big 'thank you' for their understanding when the truth came out.

Despite all the people who have come forwards, and are still coming forwards, to talk about what Robin has done to them, I'm still not clear how much of it is illegal. What I am clear on is that he is a dangerous man - I don't mean in terms of violence because that doesn't appear to be his style - but in terms of lying like truth and being able to persuade almost anyone of almost anything when we really should know better.

I know it's very unusual to put something like this out in the public domain, and if it were anyone other than Robin Tobin* I'd be worried about a libel suit, but the only way people will be able to avoid making mistakes like the ones we've made is if they're forewarned. So please, consider yourself forewarned.

There's a Part Two to this post <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/10/trust_issues.html"">here</a>.

P.S. I really didn't choose that picture to make Robin look ominous; I just didn't have another one to hand.

""Surreal"" is a word I've been using a lot lately. Well, you've read my <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/10/announcement.html"">previous post</a> so you can imagine what I'm talking about. Fake personal history, fake daughters, fake marriages, non-existent cars, non-existent houses, non-existent court cases. When it comes to unscrambling our business dealings from Robin Tobin's influence there's a lot of work to do - with frequent breaks for us to just sit and boggle at the scope and logistical complexity of the deceptions we allowed ourselves to become ensnared in. It's a muddle and a mess and an embarrassment but we can, to a point, sort of shrug and get to work digging ourselves out. What I can't accept or even begin to get comfortable with are the stories I hear from the women who have been involved with Robin. If you are one of those women or you know one, maybe you would keep reading because Em and I have the beginnings of a plan for how we could make a start on repairing some of the damage.","What I didn't mention in my last post, when I was talking about the women Robin has tricked, manipulated and two-timed, is that Emma was one of them. She was going through a divorce and Robin became the perfect, supportive, understanding suitor. If it weren't for the fact he was still involved with two other women (that we know of) you could really believe he was a lovely guy.

You might wonder how anyone could juggle such a tangled personal life and not be discovered sooner. I think I've worked out at least some of the answers. For a start, compartmentalisation played a big role. As I understand it, girlfriends are normally forbidden from contacting Robin's work colleagues, friends or family. If there's any danger of one woman learning about the existence of another they'll be primed to expect an unstable stalker, who is not to be approached or trusted, who won't accept the relationship is long over.

His fictitious children play a central role in allowing Robin to disappear when he needs to - which happens frequently given the number of plates he needs to keep spinning. Goodness knows how many times a fall in the playground or a fever enabled Robin to duck out for two or three days. It came not just as a shock but as a kind of relief to learn that these poor, accident-prone and permanently traumatised children didn't exist.

Another important part of how the web is spun is down to pure, thinking-on-your-feet, deceptive showmanship. I've seen Robin's stories evolve on-the-fly with such smooth transitions that you hardly notice the ground shifting beneath your feet. Details are 'clarified' in such a way that you really feel a fool for getting the wrong end of the stick. And he is able to look hurt and wronged and innocent with total conviction. I'm not one of those who've seen him cry on cue, but I don't doubt the claims of those who say they have.

And finally, many of those who are in a position to warn others are afraid. They've been threatened and they believe Robin has powerful friends (his shady Russian business contacts, his tame pitbull-style barrister 'Darren' who'll sue you for harassment, and many other allies, all non-existent from what I can tell). A number of these women have young children and want to protect them from any unpleasantness. And they live in fear of the visit from the Social Services that Robin assures them they'll receive if they contact anyone they shouldn't.

What I'm getting at here is that I understand at least part of how Robin is able to form such a strong and rapid bond with the women he involves himself with and how he is, for a while, able to convince them that they are the very centre of his world. What I probably haven't managed to convey, or even to understand myself, is the sense of loss he leaves behind. It's no understatement to say that many of these women are devastated when they learn the truth. Part of it is learning how thoroughly they have been deceived, but an even larger part of it seems to be that they honestly believed they had met their true soulmate, the love of their life. Some, apparently, are so smitten they want him back even when they know about how he's treated their many predecessors, presumably because they believe themselves to be the exception: the one he's finally going to settle down with.

So, where I see a scruffy, middle-aged man with a likable manner, the women he targets see a person they're eager to spend the rest of their life with. And it takes a lot of work and a lot of persuasion to get them to give up that dream. Fortunately the truth is a bucket of cold water, and in Em's case it didn't take too long for her to realise how completely she'd been manipulated. That said, it still required long conversations with some of Robin's previous victims and with his enormously long-suffering and exhausted father, for whom I have terrific sympathy.

To that end, it seems like an increasingly important idea that Em and I find a way to get Robin's victims in contact with one another. Many of them feel terribly foolish for being taken in when, in many cases, their friends and family could see that something was seriously amiss. In some cases this has driven a wedge between them and the support network they would normally rely on. That isolation is compounded because no one else understands what they've been through.  But I've also seen how, by talking to each other, they can start to feel stronger.

And of course before the need for support comes the need to recognise the truth. What you might call 'breaking the spell' - and it's not easy. A concerned friend or two are not going to talk most women out of what they believe is true love. But a dozen former victims who can quote you the lines he'll have used and the stories he'll have told might well get through.

And finally, what allows Robin to find new victims is the anxious silence of his former victims (coupled with the legitimising effect that his association with companies like Snowbooks or Onix Central can have - but we're fixing that right now). I can't help but think more women would be prepared to take a stand or go public with their experiences if they knew they had the support and the encouragement of others who had been through the same thing.

To that end, we've set up an e-mail address: <a href=""mailto:After.RT@gmail.com"">After.RT@gmail.com</a> for people to get in touch with Em and me and those victims of Robin's we're already in contact with. We have an idea or two for how victims, or their friends and family, can share their experiences and support each other, and that e-mail address will be the first point of contact for creating that support network. 

Em told me that she now knows that Robin joined an online dating site the same evening he moved in with her and is currently active on several more. Couple that with the fact he was still seeing two other women when he got involved with Emma and this starts to look like a production-line approach to conning women. So drop us a line at <a href=""mailto:After.RT@gmail.com"">After.RT@gmail.com</a> whatever stage of that process you're currently at or if you're one of those watching it happen to someone else and wanting to find some allies.

Just so you don't think it's <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/10/announcement.html"">all-sociopath</a>-<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/10/trust_issues.html"">all-the-time</a> here, I wanted to say something about the rather childish enthusiasm I'm seeing for 3D movies at the moment - and I'm not talking about the audience; I'm talking about the childlike enthusiasm of the film industry.

I'm far from the only one who keeps an eye on both the music and the movie industries as a way of peering into possible futures for book publishing. All three sectors package essentially intangible products of uncertain and frequently inscrutable appeal for a fickle customer-base and all three are struggling with the impact of changes in technology. It's getting easier to physically make (if not to author) music, movies and books and it's getting easier to consume them - without paying if you want.","The movie industry started out with total ownership of the system. You couldn't make your own movie - not one with titles and lighting and a soundtrack - and you couldn't pirate one to watch at home because you needed a cinema with a couple of giant projectors to show it in. But the movie industry realised they could make a lot of cash by loosening the strings by which they kept hold of the means of production and distribution. First they let TV companies show movies, then they sold them directly to consumers on VHS tapes. The first of those steps allowed movies into the living room - but only when the TV and movie companies agreed you could watch them. The second step sold off control of scheduling too. Or course with VCRs you could tape a movie off of the TV anyway, so selling official VHS copies of a movie was really just a way to keep up.

Making movies is still pricey but the cost has been plummeting for a century now. Cheap solid-state video cameras cost under a hundred pounds and fit in your palm. Whereas two or three thousand pounds will buy you a pretty decent 'prosumer' HD camcorder. Movies still need actors and lighting and insurance and crafts service, but everything from capturing the images (and sound) on down the production pipeline costs a tenth of what it did fifteen years ago. What used to be high-end quality can now be achieved for peanuts, in Hollywood budget terms. Once it became possible to shoot a movie with enough pixels for cinema release on an indie budget a lot of new players piled into the industry. That's good news for viewers and bad news for Hollywood.

By this point in the history of movies, you can watch them on your phone, your computer, in your car, on your iPod - and if you don't want to go to the cinema you can build one in your living room for a thousand pounds or so (which a surprising number of people do) with a big flat-screen, a decent DVD player and a surround-sound speaker setup. The strings have been loosened almost as far as they could be and there's no more money to be made from loosening them further. The industry has tried to offer total convenience in movie-watching while maintaining total control of copying and distribution and of course it hasn't worked. It's not even possible. What they really need is a way to start again.

And that's what 3D movies offer. They create a new premium-level viewing experience that isn't available on your phone or PC. The means of production is pricier - which suits Hollywood. There are no prosumer camcorders likely to shoot HD-resolution 3D any time soon. If Hollywood can make you think that 'proper' movies are in 3D and everything else is amateurish then they can buy themselves another decade of controlling the movie industry at the creative end. For cinemas, it's a chance to pull ahead of the living room again and offer something you can't get at home (for which multiplexes are busily charging a premium all over America at the moment). And in a few years' time, that advantage can be auctioned off by selling us all 3D televisions. It's also a chance to side-step piracy concerns by creating something that needs special equipment to view.

Blu-Ray was supposed to do a lot of this, but from what I can tell, people haven't been biting. Until we all switch to 60+"" TVs, most of us can't spot the faults with standard DVD. But we can all tell if we're watching 3D or not. So at a stroke, Hollywood, the cinema chains, the electronics companies and the media stores get a new lease of life and a new level of control. And the only drawback I can see is that most people don't actually seem to particularly care for 3D movies. It's a technology with a lot of supply and relatively little demand. But you wouldn't know it from the amount of advertising you see. Sadly for the industry, I think cinema has done far too good a job teaching us that movies are flat to suddenly persuade us we've been missing out all these years.

It'll be almost as interesting to see what happens if 3D fails as if it takes off. And for anyone looking to predict the future of the book industry by gazing at its more forward-looking cousins it's clear that we're a long way away from anything analogous happening with books. But you can see how such a thing might start. I've talked in the past about how cool a multimedia, semi-intelligent book might be. I'm not thinking so much about novels here as textbooks and non-fiction. Embedded video, content which updates itself, and rearranges itself based on user preference. My examples included nature books which talk you through the process of identifying a bird or a plant, asking follow-up questions based on your answers, before taking you to the relevant entry. Or textbooks with live quizzes at the end of the chapters, where what you read next depends on how you scored. Science books with experiments in them. Programming books which actually run their own example code and yours too. If any of these things catch on, you could easily imagine a world where plain 'dead' paper books might be considered a hobbyist's platform with the industry pinning its hopes on semi-intelligent, interactive 'live' publications.

If the day comes when book piracy is a serious problem for the industry, enhancing books so that they're more than simply big text files will become a priority. 

From the comments we tend to receive, I'd say that most of us are against any changes to the historical idea of what a book is. We want it to be an attractive, paper object with a familiar feel and smell. It will be interesting, then, to see how many of us are leading the charge in ten years' time to persuade the book-reading world to leave all that behind and to spend their money on 'live' publications. Who knows, some of the 'live' multimedia content we're pushing might even be 3D.","","","","2010-11-01","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Hello world. I'm back!","Well, that was a thing, wasn't it (cf. Rob's previous <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/10/trust_issues.html#more"">posts</a>). Sorry I've been absent for a while. I stopped blogging around about the time when my marriage finally broke down. I didn't really want to share the fact on here - I was worried that people would roll their eyes and tut at my private life. Now, of course, getting divorced has been put firmly into perspective. It's been mortifying having to reveal to the world the hellish pickle I've got myself in to, but it's been heartening to receive so many notes of support and kindness. Thanks particularly to Snowbooks authors for your patience and understanding whilst I collected myself. Good news: the backlog is getting cleared, the road ahead is getting clearer and, mostly importantly, my delicious brains are fully back in gear. I shouldn't get ahead of myself: the full healing process will take a while, but for the moment, suffice to say I'm back in the saddle. 

So, where were we? Ah yes, books. Shall I tell you about some that we have lined up for the coming months? They're rather super. Yes? You'd like that? Oh, OK then, stop twisting my arm. Ow. OW. Gerroff.

The New Year starts with a super coup: the latest from Paul Magrs who has brilliantly decided to let Snowbooks publish Enter Wildthyme. Iris Wildthyme is friends with Doctor Who. I think that's all you need to know. 

<img alt=""9781906727277.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/9781906727277.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""461"" />

The latest from (and I don't say this lightly) top horror author Thomas Emson will be out in hardback this week. The vampire plague continues to spread in Krimson. It's out in paperback in Feb. 

<img alt=""thumb9781906727987.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/thumb9781906727987.jpg"" width=""300"" />

Also in February we'll be publishing Drop Dead Gorgeous, the next corker from Wayne Simmons, author of the bestselling Flu.

Then in March, look at this lovely thing: The Martian Ambassador. (Cover design by me: see end of this post!) It's set in London in 1899, six years after the discovery of intelligent life on Mars.

<img alt=""thumb9781906727994.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/thumb9781906727994.jpg"" width=""300"" />

March brings the second in the Burton and Swinburne series by Mark Hodder - The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man. What if Time presented Charles Darwin with a different set of opportunities? What if he became a super-criminal? Florence Nightingale a rogue surgeon? Isambard Kingdom Brunel a living corpse in a massive mechanized steam-driven body? 

And that's just a few of the books in the first three months of 2011 (which I hope for all our sakes will be a hell of a lot better than this poxy year [shakes fist at 2010]). See? It might have looked quiet but there's been a lot going on behind the scenes! 

And for old time's sake, why don't we do a to do list? Yes, why not. Here is a heavily abridged version of what I'm up to at the moment. 

- Royalties. This year we moved to a new system for calculating royalties. Never do that. Our royalties will all (finally) be successfully calculated within the week. Do not ask about the process for achieving this as it has been long, slow, painful, boring, difficult, confusing, disappointing and complicated. My sincere apologies to Snowbooks authors that they're late. Won't happen again. 

- Update website. It still says 'summer' on the homepage yet I sit here with woolly socks on thinking about a snifter of brandy, purely for medicinal systemic warming purposes. That can't be right. 

- Do eBooks. Some of our books are in a number of ebook formats, but not enough (either titles or formats). It's my next major piece of work. Should be fun, and hopefully lucrative. 

- Catch up on paperwork. I owe signed copy contracts, emails and paperwork to a number of people - it's on the way. 

- Learn bookkeeping. I have always done the bookkeeping for Snowbooks, and the summary for my approach is possibly best described as 'unsophisticated'. Entering basic transactions is one thing: entering journals to move income from LBS's ringfenced trust account to the sales ledger, then to the cash account, then to Snowbooks' current account ledger is quite another and I'd like to be able to do it without relying on an outside bookkeeper. In fact I really want to get on top of all the financial admin of the business once and for all. So today I've started an Open University Bookkeeping course. By Christmas I'll be a qualified bookkeeper. I find this hilarious. 

- Get some money in. All this recent nonsense has left me well out of pocket, personally, and to fill the gap I'm going to ramp up the cover design work I do for client publishers. I've knocked together a portfolio here: <a href=""http://www.snowangels.org""/>www.snowangels.org</a>. If you'd like me to do some design for you, along the lines of the covers in this post, I'd be delighted. Money *and* fun design - a lovely combination.

You know what: it's nice to be posting again. I am so proud of our books and I've got out of the habit of blogging about them. Brace yourselves for some renewed bragging. Anyhoo, so what have you been up to, then? Did I miss anything?","","","","2010-11-01","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","8"

Like one of those straggly cheap trees which are the only ones left at the Christmas Tree place because you've left it too late, our Christmas offering is a bit sparse this year. We have Krimson in hardback, which is brilliant, but not much else. This is as much to do with the eye-watering marketing charges at this time of year than anything. 

However: great news! Lovely Waterstone's are running a horror promotion in section over the next 8 weeks. You may have noticed that we have some rather fine <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_horror.html"">examples</a> of the genre. So this morning when I looked at sales, there's hundreds of copies of most of them sold! It's made it a nearly 5000 sales week, which is smashing, and a lot more than if we'd have sold one or two frontlist titles on promotion - along with the associated marketing charges and print bills. It's only taken 7 years, but at last we have a viable business in the backlist. Yey!

Right: on with my To Do list!","","","","","2010-11-06","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

Well done, Em, for lightening the tone. And now, back to the bad news.

This will be my third and hopefully (fingers crossed) final post about Emma's and my disastrous involvement with Robin Tobin. At least for a while. With any luck. See <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/10/announcement.html#more"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/10/trust_issues.html#more"">here</a> for parts I and II. This post is the potted history of the business that the three of us started - Onix Central - the business that on Monday of this week we effectively shut down because our principal product, unbeknownst to us, turns out to be built on pirated code, courtesy of Guess Who? (Clue: he features prominently in the two  posts mentioned above.) I hope no one will be offended by my flippant tone here: in difficult times I tend to favour slightly inappropriate black humour over despair.","I'll tell you what we thought was going on and then I'll tell you what was really happening.

So this version of the tale is full of lies, but lies that Emma and I actually believed up until recently. What we <em>thought</em> we  were doing was taking Robin's experience at his former company, Anko Publishing Software, and creating a next-generation competitor to their Anko Publishing Manager (APM). For those who don't know, the APM helped you manage your ONIX data and assisted with a lot of the core publishing processes as well. Robin had  founded Anko and written their APM software before he was cruelly forced out of the firm. But Robin had learned a lot since writing the original APM and decided to start afresh, building a new system from the ground up which incorporated all the improvements his experience had taught him publishers were crying out for. He also had good relationships with many of Anko's customers and felt that many of them would be eager (he said) to switch their business to us. Robin would focus on development while Emma ran the business day to day and handled most of the other jobs, like writing the manual, creating and updating the website and so on. I was supposed to be a technical architect of sorts, planning how we'd move the initial version of the software, which uses FileMaker, onto the web. As it turned out, for a number of reasons, I did very little, but Emma has been working flat out for eighteen months, running Snowbooks, then finding another eight hours or so a day to put into Onix Central, while simultaneously looking after her young son.

As I mentioned in previous instalments, we believed that Anko not only made it impossible for Robin to stay, they also hounded him once he left, getting a court to freeze his assets and spreading false accusations about him. He was the goose that laid the golden eggs and they were intent on profiting from his efforts regardless of his wishes. Once we knew that the other 999 things we thought we knew about Robin were deceptions, we checked out his version of the Anko story and found, as expected, that most of it was hogwash, with one or two genuine facts sprinkled in, but given an expert twist in order to convince the casual observer without giving the game away.

It's not my place to tell the Anko story, and the tale itself is complicated by the fact that Robin's father, Paschal Tobin, is one of the principals of the business. Suffice it to say that having spent a couple of days chatting with Paschal, Emma and I are full of admiration for him and his attempts to make the honourable best of a completely impossible situation. And of course Paschal's version of events not only fits the facts far better, it makes vastly more sense than Robin's concoction of half-truths and paranoid-sounding accusations. We also discovered in our conversations that while Robin was indeed a founder of the firm, he contributed very little of their code. I've intimated before that Robin is something of a genius when it comes to his deceptions, but his gifts don't appear to extend to detail-oriented, single-focus tasks like programming. He hasn't the temperament, the necessary concentration span or the fundamental motivation to sit still for eight hours at a time perfecting FileMaker scripts and finessing tables. Which rang alarm bells with us. After all, isn't that just what Robin had supposedly been doing for the last year or more? I mean, I'd always wondered how he could write functioning code when he couldn't put a three-line e-mail together without two typos and a missing word...

On the other hand, we'd just learned that he would court multiple women at the same time, while harrassing others, contacting new ones on dating sites, chatting to his current victims on instant message software - making sure that each thought they were the sole and future Mrs. Robin Tobin -  while keeping his exes in check - and we'd wondered where he could possibly have found the time. So, anyone in the audience want to venture a guess at the answer to that question?

In the words of Aristotle: 'Doh!'. The eight hours a day that Robin wasn't really writing code for us were the very same eight hours a day he was actually managing his empire of deceit and fake relationships.

Which led on to the follow-up question, if Robin wasn't really writing our code, then where was it coming from? Every step of the way Robin had needed pleading, cajoling and humouring to get him to produce anything, but eventually, after enormous amounts of drama and numerous diva-like meltdowns, we had actually received from him a product that was 95% finished. In a fit of exasperation, Emma somehow found even more hours in the day and took over the final stage of development required to fill in that final 5% and to test the resultant product. We'd got a handsome piece of functional software from somewhere, but where? 

If Robin didn't write the bulk of Anko's APM and he didn't write the bulk of our competitor to it, where had the main body of our code come from? Once again, Paschal Tobin was able to provide the answer. Onix Central's Publishing Manager (OCPM) wasn't so much a ground-up rewrite of the idea behind Anko's APM, as it was a makeover with a few new bells and whistles. New functions had been added, the visual interface had been substantially altered, but hidden in the detail, scripts and table relationships had simply been lifted, wholesale, from Anko's APM. We've seen the screenshots of code from the two products laid side-by-side: and it seems, though Emma and I never intended it, that we're pirates now - but not the crowd-pleasing, Johnny Depp kind, unfortunately.

So just to recap our relationship with Anko: while believing, thanks to Robin, that they were cads of the first order, we had used a laptop which they owned to take the software that they had written to make a competitor to their main product which, as well as being offered to new customers, we would use to lure away some of their old clients. I'm not sure that 'Oops' really covers it. From a purely selfish point of view, it's a darned good thing that Robin's father is our contact at Anko because he instantly understood how we could have unwittingly done such a thing.

And while we're talking about cold comfort, this recent revelation has at least removed the need to solve a particularly tricky moral dilemma we'd been wrestling with. For a while, once we knew that Robin was, in essence, a confidence trickster with a very sordid and prolific romantic history, we still had no idea that our software was pirated. Even though Onix Central had been founded by the three of us, Robin didn't want to be a named director of the firm and he'd signed his share in the ownership of the company over to Emma. His stated reasons for this, to do with the non-existent Anko court case, are a smoke-screen. I assume he has enough angry people after him that he doesn't want his name to appear in places like Companies House. But whatever his motives, it meant that it was straightforward for Emma and me, as the only two directors and the only two shareholders, to eject Robin from the business. Morally, however, we worried about confiscating all his hard work. On the one hand, he'd apparently put in months of effort which Onix Central would now benefit from, but on the other hand, we knew what he'd do with any income: he'd continue to seduce, manipulate and traumatise women. Having spent many hours on the phone to one of his victims who'd told me that Robin's apparently legitimate business connections had allayed her worries that he was a con man I couldn't see myself posting a cheque to Robin each month and one day having to look one of his victims in the eyes and tell her that I'd done that. Equally it didn't sit well at all to put ourselves in a position to profit financially from what we thought must surely be the only piece of proper, honest work that Robin had ever done.

Well, as you can see, we needn't have worried. We're not cutting Robin out of a fortune; we're ejecting him from a business with no source of income. We've withdrawn our OCPM from sale, notified our customers, and we're making arrangements with Anko to offer our customers a possible migration path. We've also signed over whatever IP we might retain in the OCPM to Anko in case it's of any use to them. Anko, very kindly, have extended a sort of retrospective licence to customers of our product, covering them for the fact that part of the software they bought is really Anko property. In addition, Emma intends to work with Anko to offer a support contract to any of Onix Central's customers who may want to go down that route.

Snowbooks, fortunately, remains unaffected, except for a few blows to the dignity and reputation of its directors.

And Robin remains at large, whereabouts unknown, presumably taken in by some kind-hearted woman somewhere who truly believes she is rescuing a lost soul and not sheltering a monster. We have been in communication with the Thames Valley Police, but it's proving very difficult to come up with concrete charges upon which they could act, though I suspect that each report they receive about him from someone new makes it more difficult for him to continue to operate with impunity. Robin has suggested in recent e-mails to us that he will continue to offer the Onix Central Publishing Manager for sale and that he refutes any allegation that it's either pirated or, even if it were, that he isn't the original author of the stolen code and entitled to do with it as he pleases. Unfortunately for him, even if that were somehow true, which the evidence fails to support, you can't tell nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine lies and hope for your thousandth remark to be treated as gospel. 

So if a scruffy but charming man meeting Robin's description does approach you and offers to sell you some bibliographic software, we urge you to decline. And if someone out there does know who Robin is  in a relationship with right now, could you kindly point them in the direction of these blog posts and the e-mail address <a href=""mailto:After.RT@gmail.com"">After.RT@gmail.com</a> which is a point of contact we've established for talking with his victims.","","","","2010-11-10","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

No matter how long you work for yourself; no matter how the traditional working hours, evenings and weekends merge into one another, I always like Fridays. Because it's the end of the week! Er, even if I will do 8 hours at least on both weekend days. 

And I'm feeling remarkably light-hearted on this particular Friday. Perhaps it is mania. That is a definite possibility. Perhaps it is a great boredom with thinking about all the crap that's gone on, and just wanting to be happy instead. Also true. Perhaps it is because so many silver linings have appeared in this week, and I've had so many conversations with kind, thoughtful and generous people, that it's restored my faith in human kindness and serendipity. 

I hope that over the coming days, weeks and months we'll have lots of good things to share with you here. I think things are on the way up. But for today: hey! It's Friday! Tell me Fridayish things.","","","","","2010-11-12","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","6"

I know, I'm a nerd. But I do enjoy geeking out on a Sunday. Imagine me surrounded late at night by empties of Mountain Dew, novelty hat perched atop my head, servers whirring, illuminated only by the glow of the screen. None of that is, of course, the case. However, I have found enough geek in me to knock together a bit of handy XSL tonight. 

I'm knee-deep in creating ePub versions of all our books. ePub books live or die by their metadata - the stuff that describes what's in 'em. I really don't want to enter all that bibliographic metadata manually when it's all safely stored already in my Onix data. So here's a video to show how I get it out of the Onix format and into Adobe's XMP format. It's very quick and it's very accurate - and 'quick' and 'accurate' are things what I like. 

I suppose I'd better put the video below the cut to be sensitive to those Snowblog readers who really couldn't care less about code. Think of it this way, though - this'll save me about a day's work, not to mention the embarrassment and lost sales due to the inaccuracy that my cack-handed manual data entry would inevitably lead to. More time to do fun things! Like, er, my bookkeeping course which I'm really enjoying and will tell you about later. Anyway.

File this post of mine under 'a day late and a dollar short', but I thought I'd (belatedly) share this little morsel of interest from a couple of weeks ago that kind of makes you wonder about news reporting in the media. It's from the London riots over university tuition fees.  

Most people have seen the picture in the thumbnail there. Click on it to see a bigger version. There are two really interesting things about it. One: it more or less became the print media's official picture of the riots. You can ask yourself why that would be (too good not to use? not much else they could use?).

Please click on it to see a larger version. Doesn't that put a completely different complexion on the scene? Is it really a riot if ten photographers, in a pretty docile-looking crowd, watch one lunatic break a window? Or is it OK to use a picture that turns out not to be very riotous if you're using it to give the impression of the sort of rioting that you <em>believe</em> is going on nearby but don't have any cool photos to illustrate? Even if you go for the latter explanation, it's difficult not to feel like you've been 'had' when you get a look at the original photo's backdrop.

How seriously hard can it be? The whole world is eBook mad at the moment, yet creating the things still seems like a dark art. Anyway, here's a post distilling my research and practice which I hope will shed some light on how you create the things and make them look nice. It's a deliberately simplified approach designed to get your books converted quickly, which is handy when you have a backlog like me. 

---update---
<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/How%20to%20Create%20EBooks.pdf"">Here's a PDF</a> of this post.","<b>Formats</b>

Snowbooks is concentrating for the moment on two formats: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB"">ePub</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobipocket"">Mobipocket</a>. You can read ePub books on the iPad and the iPhone, on the iBooks app. You can read Mobi on Amazon's Kindle. That's surely 80% of the market, and indeed it's our view that the Kindle offering is powering ahead of Apple in its range of titles and availability of readers. For instance, you can read a Kindle title (in the Mobi format) on an iPhone, a PC, a Mac and an iPad, if you download and install the relevant app. However, you can only read an iBook (in the ePub format) on an iPad and iPhone - there's no app for a Mac computer. Berserk. 

There are a number of other formats which include: 
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FictionBook"">FictionBook (.fb2)</a>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Reader"">Microsoft Reader (.lit) for PCs</a>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBeB"">Broadband eBooks (.lrf) for the Librie</a>
<a href=""http://www.ereader.com/"">eReader (.pdb) for the Nook</a>
and also PDF, PMLZ, RB, RTF, SBN, TCR, TXT and Zip. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.lrf#Broadband_eBooks"">Here's</a> an exhaustive comparison of available formats. 

<b>Software and resources</b>

I'm using <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=indesign"">InDesign CS5</a> to create the eBooks, <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/"">Adobe Digital Editions</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/mac"">Kindle for the Mac</a> to preview them, <a href=""http://threepress.org/document/epub-validate"">ePub Validator</a> from the lovely Threepress Consulting to check them, if I want, and <a href=""http://calibre-ebook.com/"">Calibre</a> to convert the ePub format to the Kindle format. All those applications are free except for InDesign, but that link above is to the free 30 day trial which is worth grabbing. InDesign CS5 has a handy new feature which is worth upgrading for - I'll tell you more in a moment. 

I read the following useful documents and websites: 
<a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/design/crossmedia_resources/ebooks_software.html"">Adobe white papers</a>

<b>The Process: Summary</b>
To create the ePub:
- Add separate Indesign (.indd) files to an InDesign Book document (which allows you to combine multiple individual files into a set). There should be a file which contains the cover image, and a file which contains the typeset text. 
- Set up the cover
- Export to ePub
- Upload to iBooks and Waterstone's

To create the Mobi:
- Open the ePub file in Calibre
- Convert to Mobi using the very straightforward conversion wizard.
- Upload to Amazon

<b>The Process: Detail</b>
- Typeset the book in InDesign, making sure to use <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/01/paragraph_and_character_styles.html"">paragraph and character styles</a>, not local formatting. Make sure you use one style for the chapter headings. This is the style which we'll use to break up the eBook into sections, so only use it on text which you want to start in a new section. Save the typesetting as a single .indd file (don't bother splitting it into one file per chapter, since there's a lovely feature in CS5 which does this for you). 

- Design the cover in Photoshop and place into a new .indd file. It doesn't have to be the same size as the typeset file, but it doesn't hurt if it is. My cover images are 423 x 650 px, 35 x 55mm at 300 pixels per inch - don't make them too large as readers have a limit on the size and won't display at all if the image is much bigger than this. You can download <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/Cover.indd"">this InDesign file</a> and place your cover in the image frame. Note that the cover image is centred. I achieved this by applying a paragraph style to the text frame in which the cover is placed - a method which ensures the centring is carried over into the ePub product. (This tip alone took me about a day's research to figure out...)

- Add both .indd files to an InDesign Book document (which allows you to combine multiple individual files into a set.) Go to File > New > Book and save it as a sensible name e.g. AffinityBridge.indb. Add files to the book by clicking on the + button on the Book palette and navigating to your files. (You can add more files, containing dedications, acknowledgements, end notes etc. but let's keep it simple in this example.) Make sure the file which contained the cover is the first in the list by clicking on it and dragging it to the top. 

<img alt=""indb.41"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/indb.41"" width=""318"" height=""242"" />

- The first document needs to be the one which defines all the styles in the resultant eBook, so load the cover.indd file with the typeset styles. To to this, open the Paragraph Style palette in Cover.indd, and on the option menu (the one you get by clicking all the way in the top right hand corner of the palette) select Load Paragraph Styles. Navigate to the file which contains the typeset text and simply Open. The Styles from the typeset doc will be loaded into the cover doc. Do the same for Character styles.  

<img alt=""Screen shot 2010-12-04 at 21.45.33.png"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Screen%20shot%202010-12-04%20at%2021.45.33.png"" width=""500"" />

- To finish off this styles process, set the cover file as the Style Source. Do this by clicking on the box to the left of the Cover file name on the Book palette. This allows most eBook readers to identify this file as the one which contains the cover, which they use for their thumbnails. 

- You want your eBook to be easily navigable, and for this you'll need a table of contents. To do this, set a TOC style in the cover.indd file. So, go to Layout > Table of Contents Styles and select New. From the list of Other Styles, select the one which you've used for chapter headings and click on Add. InDesign will use this to create a useful table of contents. At the same time it breaks the book up into chapters, which makes for a much faster reading experience. Not only that - it means each chapter starts on a page break which is a really nice way to format an eBook (as opposed to the relentless stream of non-breaking text which you'd otherwise get).

- Make sure you <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/11/onix_to_xmp.html"">add metadata</a> to your book to make it easily discoverable.

- And you're almost done. Export to ePub from the Book palette menu. Click on Export Book to EPUB:

<img alt=""Screen shot 2010-12-04 at 21.52.23.png"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Screen%20shot%202010-12-04%20at%2021.52.23.png"" width=""500"" />

Then fill out the dialogue boxes as follows: 

<img alt=""Screen shot 2010-12-04 at 21.54.00.png"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Screen%20shot%202010-12-04%20at%2021.54.00.png"" width=""500"" />

Obviously change the publisher name. The unique ID gets created automatically for you. 

<img alt=""Screen shot 2010-12-04 at 21.56.59.png"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Screen%20shot%202010-12-04%20at%2021.56.59.png"" width=""500"" />

<img alt=""Screen shot 2010-12-04 at 21.57.37.png"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Screen%20shot%202010-12-04%20at%2021.57.37.png"" width=""500"" />

This last screen is where the good stuff is. Choose XHTML. DTBook is for people with visual impairment, but isn't a universally supported standard so don't choose unless you know what you're doing. 

Select 'Include InDesign TOC Entries' and 'Use First Level Entries as Chapter Breaks' which will use the chapter headings paragraph style to nicely subdivide your book into chapters automatically. That's the single most useful additional functionality between CS4 and CS5. Check 'Suppress Automatic Entries for Documents', so that the actual name of the chapter appears, rather than 'filename-1', 'filename-2' which is a bit ugly. 

Don't select 'Include Embeddable Fonts'. The functionality is meant to allow you to include fonts in your ePub book, so even if the end reader doesn't have a font installed on their machine, they'd still be able to view the font. However, not all eBook readers support this functionality, and when they don't, you run the risk of fancy fonts being dropped and replaced with something horrible, out of your control. Much better to keep control, and amend your paragraph styles so that any particularly florid fonts are replaced with something a bit more pedestrian (and therefore likely to be installed on most people's machines). 

Hit Export and wait! The ePub version will open in Adobe Digital Editions. 

- Upload to iBooks and Waterstone's
Apple make it quite easy to register and sell iBooks. Here's their <a href=""https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/apply"">iConnect app</a> which only took me half an hour to sort out including validating my bank account details. Email Waterstone's on eBooks.Temp@waterstones.com for their set up process. 

To create the Mobi:
- Open the ePub file in Calibre. It's the icon on the far left.
<img alt=""Screen shot 2010-12-04 at 22.07.25.png"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Screen%20shot%202010-12-04%20at%2022.07.25.png"" width=""500"" />

- Convert to Mobi using the very straightforward conversion wizard. That's the icon third from the left.
They have a built in user manual if you get stuck but it all seems quite self-explanatory to me. 

- Upload to Amazon. If you don't have an account, email vendor-central@amazon.com to be sent details.

For most of us, the phrase 'knowledge is power' is maybe a bit strong, but 'knowledge is currency' might be true. And, increasingly, I think that knowledge is relevancy. I meet too many people who are making decisions about software projects, web programming, data standards and digital workflow who don't really know what any of that stuff means - certainly not at the level of being able to do any of it themselves. I suppose it's partly a consequence of extending the idea that older people have more experience into areas where it doesn't really apply - that's to say, areas where technology invalidates the usefulness of what you know at a terrifying rate. And it's also about the idea that 'management' is separate from 'detail'. That's to say, the idea that an experienced manager can exist on a plane of pure decision-making where they don't need to possess any of the specialist skills of the people beneath them. But I've never really believed in that idea. Getting 'bogged down in details' as pure management people often call it, is usually where all the important, make-or-break stuff happens, in my experience.","So what are we all to do as everything about publishing (and the rest of the world too) gets more technically complex? Ten years ago I knew people who boasted that they didn't 'do' IT; they had people for that. Is it still OK to be someone who doesn't really know how the software their business runs on operates or what it's capable of? Especially for small businesses, it's not possible to just delegate that stuff to the geeks, because geeks are in short supply and they cost money.

I really think most of us need to take the bull by the horns and try to become more technically competent - not just once, but as part of our daily lives. It's like the way some of us might have claimed that we just couldn't do maths when we were kids but we realised that stance wasn't acceptable once we started drawing up budgets and scrutinising sales forecasts.

Also, I think 2011 is when eBooks will really start to bite. They're going to account for a big chunk of the market for the first time, which means most of us will be working in businesses where one of our channels to market is all digital - from the Word manuscript that comes in, through typesetting, cover design, metadata and ONIX distribution, calendaring and e-mail, ordering, eBook creation, maintaining a Web presence and accounting: it's all going to be software-based, interconnected and tricky to understand. And most of those technologies change so rapidly that it doesn't matter if you studied them in college if college was more than five years ago.

So are any companies out there putting effort into constantly re-training their non-IT people to be more technically capable and up-to-date? Are any of you lone wolves and small businesses trying to self-educate on IT? Has anyone got any tips about how best to do it*? 

*I'm assuming my approach of reading thick manuals the whole time isn't going to suit most people.","","","","2010-12-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

So then. What about all this WikiLeaks stuff? As a news story it's got everything I want. And ideologically, I have to say that it feels like poetic justice for all the lies we've had to swallow about wars and what-have-you over the last ten years. Lies give you an edge when they're undetected but backfire when they're exposed. There's been so much lying that it's inevitable the truth will make a lot of people look bad but I think that's their fault and not Julian Assange's.

I feel like the US and UK governments now consider it their right to lie to us and won't stand for any interference. I have a tiny smidgeon of sympathy for the idea that you can't broker a deal if you can't explore unpopular options and change your mind occasionally (as Clay Shirky <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40554220/ns/technology_and_science-security/"">notes</a>) - and all of that is tricky if there's no privacy. But don't these leaks show that misrepresenting the situation has not been a stepping stone on the way to an acceptable truth; it's been a way of life.

The WikiLeaks sites have been attacked repeatedly and someone has persuaded hosting sites, DNS providers, PayPal, etc; to drop them. Swiss banks, notorious for keeping dodgy money secret, want nothing to do with Assange's <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11929034"">cash</a>. And Sweden asked Interpol to help them track Assange down over a rape allegation which, I'm quite certain, would not normally trigger an international man-hunt. (I'm assuming he didn't do it, but I'll revise my opinions of course if evidence emerges that the charge is solid.)

What I'm wondering is, is it just me who's pleased with what WikiLeaks has done, believes it's in the public interest and thinks it's horrible to go after the whistleblower and not the war criminals, madmen and buffoons he exposes? Or am I missing the public mood, here, which sees WikiLeaks as treasonous and criminal?

I'm not nearly as familiar as Emma is with the ONIX standard and it's time for that to change. But as I'm staring at it now, I'm wondering why they did things the way they did. I hesitate to describe it as 'wrong' because maybe I'm not as <em>au fait</em> with this stuff as I think I am, but I'm certainly finding bits of it 'curious'. Take an excerpt like this:","Snippet:
<div style=""color: maroon; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"">...
&lt;Measure&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MeasureType><span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">01</span>&lt;/MeasureType&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Measurement><span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">194</span>&lt;/Measurement&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MeasureUnitCode><span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">mm</span>&lt;/MeasureUnitCode&gt;
&lt;/Measure&gt;
&lt;Measure&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MeasureType&gt;<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">02</span>&lt;/MeasureType&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Measurement&gt;<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">130</span>&lt;/Measurement&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MeasureUnitCode&gt;<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">mm</span>&lt;/MeasureUnitCode&gt;
&lt;/Measure&gt;
&lt;Measure&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MeasureType&gt;<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">03</span>&lt;/MeasureType&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Measurement&gt;<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">18</span>&lt;/Measurement&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MeasureUnitCode&gt;<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">mm</span>&lt;/MeasureUnitCode&gt;
&lt;/Measure&gt;
...</div>

In order to find the Measure element for the dimension you're interested in, you have to look inside each Measure and know that it's the code in the MeasureType child element you want to check. Why wouldn't you write it like this instead:
<div style=""color: maroon; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"">...
&lt;Measure <em>MeasureType</em>=""<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">01</span>"" &gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Measurement><span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">194</span>&lt;/Measurement&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MeasureUnitCode><span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">mm</span>&lt;/MeasureUnitCode&gt;
&lt;/Measure&gt;
&lt;Measure <em>MeasureType</em>=""<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">02</span>"" &gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Measurement&gt;<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">130</span>&lt;/Measurement&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MeasureUnitCode&gt;<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">mm</span>&lt;/MeasureUnitCode&gt;
&lt;/Measure&gt;
&lt;Measure <em>MeasureType</em>=""<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">03</span>"" &gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Measurement&gt;<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">18</span>&lt;/Measurement&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MeasureUnitCode&gt;<span style=""color: green;font-weight: bold;"">mm</span>&lt;/MeasureUnitCode&gt;
&lt;/Measure&gt;
...</div>

It seems easier to use and to make more sense to use an attribute to label each Measure element and to leave the child nodes for data not labels. Is there some reason to do it the way they have?

And if you want to go the whole hog, I don't think much of their naming and code conventions either. If 'mm' can be the 'code' for millimetres, why does '01' need to be the code for height and not 'h'. Plus, the measurements are jumbled in with other information in DescriptiveDetail. I think I'd prefer this:
<div style=""color: maroon; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"">...
&lt;PhysicalDimensions&gt;

Seems to me that's more concise, easier to understand, easier to remember and easier to process if you're writing code to manipulate that data (e.g. selecting it in XPath).

It might be unfair to pick on the ONIX for Books standard like this because I've only looked at little pieces of it. And like I say, maybe I'm not as knowledgeable about XML as I think I am. But so far it looks like big chunks of it were decided very broadly in a committee and then the actual implementation was handled by someone who wasn't all that experienced. (But if it turns out there are wise and good reasons for things being the way they are please enlighten me and I'll stand corrected.)","","","","2010-12-11","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Now I'm aware I'm treading on thin ice here. But I've just finished watching the first season of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_%28TV_series%29"">The Walking Dead</a> and there's a question that's nagging at me. I loved the show, but really, what's so difficult about outwitting a zombie?

It seems to me, that the people the stories tend to follow in a zombie attack are the hot-heads who left school too early. They don't really know about cars or locks or gun-maintenance or construction. They're not planners or strong thinkers. They alternate between fear and crazy ideas. They like to settle things with their fists even when their opponents are undead. But what happens to the organised people who work well in teams and can project-manage?","The people we get to watch in most Zombie movies are like broke gamblers chancing it all one big win. What they're not like - to keep the metaphor going - is people who watch the pennies, put a little by each day and learn the ins and outs of personal finance.

Zombies have limited climbing ability, they could never work a combination lock, read instructions and they can't use tools. Any building that could withstand thirty people pushing or a handful of people halfheartedly banging things with rocks can keep out a zombie army. Designing doors that any normal human can open and no zombie can work is easy. You can even put in big letters ""the combination to this door is 1234. duck as you open it, there's a shotgun aimed at head-height"". 

I'd use monkey-bars and rope ladders a lot. Brick up all ground floor windows and doors and use rope ladders to get in and out, and with a half a day's effort, almost every home becomes secure.

And think about what you'd do if you woke up in a world where 99% of humanity is dead or undead. I wouldn't be wandering around in shirt sleeves driving whatever ridiculous, unreliable car I could find (hoping that half a tank of fuel would last forever). There's a world full of HGV lorries with nice high cabs. Every shopping centre gets visited by armored-cars for cash pick-ups. There are petrol stations and army depots, police stations and hospitals - and enough canned, dried and plastic-wrapped food in warehouses and supermarkets to last a dwindling population forever more. Even if it's already been stolen it can't all have been eaten, so track it down.

And for goodness sakes, wear protective clothing. Anything will do: a wet-suit, skateboard armour, motorcycle leathers. Gloves and helmets, people. I reckon the average safety-conscious biker would be pretty much impervious to zombie attack provided they found a way to keep their gear on.

The world is also full of burglar alarms, CCTV, car alarms and computers. Once you've kept the zombies out, design a decent security system just in case you're wrong. You've got access to a virtually infinite number of car batteries, so power isn't a problem for the next decade or so. Now you don't have to hunch in a corner, rifle across your knees, whimpering and afraid to sleep, listening to the scratching at the thin door you've propped a chair against. You can fortify the local Hilton - though a hospital is more likely to have its own generators - and you can sleep in style.

Of course, dramatically speaking, none of that would be any fun. Naturally there needs to be a desperate dash across a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Of course you turn your back, forget to post a guard, doze off at the wrong moment or leave your last shotgun shell back in the truck.

But I like to think that for every desperate, rag-tag band of survivors barely hanging on, there are a thousand level-headed engineers having a pretty pleasant time of it travelling from fuel depot to container dock on a cruise ship gathering their supplies until they're ready to settle on one of the Polynesian islands that they've systematically purged of the undead.","","","","2010-12-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","10"

"42446","","1","Amazon Monopoly","Publish","true","<div class=""pic""><img src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/Ebooks1.jpg""/></div>

The Amazon.com Kindle Store boasts ""775,000 ebooks, newspapers, magazines, blogs, and popular games & active content"". I'm not sure quite how to read that, because I'm much more interested in eBook sales than blogs and games. But <a href=""http://www.forrester.com/rb/Research/ebook_buying_is_about_to_spiral_upward/q/id/57664/t/2"">Forrester Research</a> have estimated that eBook sales were $1bn, just in the U.S., for 2010 and will be triple that by 2015. They also believe that 50% of recent eBook purchases were from the Kindle store*.

So, does that mean that the Kindle store is turning over half a billion dollars in the States alone? That sounds ludicrously high to me, but what I don't have a problem with accepting would be the idea that Amazon currently dominate the eBook market. It's ridiculously easy, once you're all set up, to buy an eBook from them. When I finished the 2nd Stieg Larsson book at 00:15 on New Year's morning, and realised I'd need to buy the 3rd book straightaway to find out what happened next, I think it's safe to say that I'd have been out of luck if I'd needed a paper copy. But it took less then a minute to find, purchase and start reading Book Three on the Kindle.","So the Kindle store has the convenience and the multi-platform reach (I can switch between reading the same Kindle book on my iPad, iPhone, a Mac and a current-generation Kindle reader - and there are other platforms available for devices I don't use). And, most significantly, the Kindle Store has the dominant range. I don't want to have to buy different eBooks from different stores and download them in different formats to run on different devices or apps. I don't want to have to remember I bought this from Kobo, but that's in iBooks. So it's perilously tempting to consider myself a Kindle customer for the foreseeable future. Which is a little bit worrying if you think about it. We're heading towards Amazon having a clear monopoly on eBooks that they could never have achieved in the world of ink-on-paper.

I had an interesting chat with Oli Brooks of <a href=""http://completelynovel.com/"">CompletelyNovel</a> about this and I wondered aloud whether the web will soon need a Monopoly & Mergers Commission and Anti-Trust Laws - and how such a thing could possibly work. Oli thought the low barriers to entry on the web meant that breaking Amazon's monopoly was still possible with the right innovative technology in a way it might not be in the offline world.

What do you guys think? Are you worried about a world in which eBooks are a huge share of the market and most of that huge share goes through Amazon? Do you think the Amazon monopoly will be a temporary thing? (Or maybe you're still convinced that eBooks are a fad.)

*At least I <em>think</em> that's what they said. The phrasing is a little ambiguous.","","","","2011-01-06","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

I'll tell you one area in which an e-book might have an advantage over a paperback: when you're trying to rush something topical out the door. I'm thinking in particular of the WikiLeaks book that the Guardian have just published. What with them being the lead newspaper behind the publication of the largest leak in history, it's an obvious story to reprise at length in book form. And as of today, you can buy a copy. But I can't see any sign of an e-book. Presumably the manuscript was signed off a few weeks ago. Why weren't Kindle readers able to grab themselves a copy in mid-January? Isn't time-sensitive publishing an obvious use of e-book technology? I think I might have to suggest that Em drive down there and explain to them how to turn an InDesign document into a Kindle book.","<em>update</em>: Ha ha. That'll teach me to be haughty. As commenter Adam points out, there actually is a Kindle version available. I couldn't find it before, but that may be my own incompetence (though you might have thought Amazon would make it obvious.)","","","","2011-02-01","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

So, I'm moving house. I'm very excited: our new house is huge and rambling and has views of the neighbour's horse, a wood, a stream and some fields.","Anyway, the reason for mentioning it is that I've got very organised (I am, in fact, 95% packed already) and have arranged for my ADSL line to be moved. Reader, it took two phone calls, and it was done. And it cost 11.99. How? you enquire. How can that be, when moving house with BT is like biting off your own arm? Aha, well, see, I would reply, I am with Zen Internet. They provide me with both my phone line and broadband service. They flicked a switch and it's all planned in for the morning of the move. 

I would say that I don't trust them, and it can't possibly all work out, and I bet they mess it up, etc. But I know they won't. I've been with them for years and they have always been a proper joy to talk to. I think you have to have been with BT previously, and ideally have undergone a house move with them, to really enjoy the sense of relief and delight at talking to a normal human in a normal way who is keen to help, quite perky and efficient and makes a job that should be quite simple and straightforward quite simple and straightforward. I would heartily recommend them as a service provider. 

And here's the really good bit. My new house has 7mbps up and down. And the previous tenants say that they did, indeed, get that speed. For the non-technical, that is a nice, jolly fast connection. Wheee!","","","","2011-02-05","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

So it's funny, being surrounded by packing boxes but not moving for a while. It has been a fun exercise in Indoor Camping, and I've been seeing whether I can live without many objects.","I was surprised that I cannot do without a spatula. I can, however, live for at least a week without butter, pepper (not salt), and a sofa. I have kept two books out - The Blasphemer by someone or other, and Wolf Hall by 'er ladyship. Wolf Hall's enjoyment is tainted for me, because we have published better books than that, in the same vein, to a fraction of the acclaim. The Blasphemer is a bit daft and a bit rubbish, but good bath reading. 

Obviously I have not packed away the power cable, the Macbook Pro, the iPhone, the Kindle, the ADSL box and the label printer. Let's not get silly. 

Ro is doing wonderful things in the absence of many toys: sea shanties, twirls, turning shoes into trains. He's in charge of putting labels in boxes. He is also the one who's job it is to make sure that once the box is packed, it stays packed. Responsible position for a boy. Not one he excels at, truth be known.

I'm a very nerdy person. Very, very nerdy. I hope that's not shattering too many fond imaginings, but you deserve the truth. I will occasionally read textbooks for fun. There, I've said it. Of course, I tend to favour standard college textbooks - the broad overview kind that will be on the reading lists of every English-speaking university in the world. They cost twenty to forty pounds for great slabs of carefully-curated info, with heaps of pretty pictures. And because I bought one of those, Amazon are suggesting I might like to buy an interesting-sounding* title in a slightly more niche area. But it's &pound;130 and I baulk at that.

 *to me at least","Now I get/understand<del>/grok</del> the volume-related economics of these things. Standard introductory college textbooks with their 'international editions' cost a fortune but they're designed to ship in their hundreds of thousands. Try to do the same amount of work on a title that will sell two thousand copies a year and the unit price would need to go through the roof to make it economically viable. Then again, glance at one of these nichier titles and you'll see it's a very different animal to the standard college intro textbook. Pages of text instead of hundreds of glossy diagrams - no CD-ROM and interactive website. So it's not as though teams of illustrators, designers and layout gurus are working round the clock on them - and I doubt that they have to be shopped extensively around educational boards for comments, checking and sign-off either.

So why the giant price tag? If I worked out that the only way to make a book profitable was to bump the cover price to three figures, I'd almost certainly abandon it. So that leads me to wonder why such things are commissioned in the way that they are. Who is it who will pay &pound;130 a time or more for books? For most academics that would mean paying more for a shelf of books than for the car they're driving. So is it just university libraries and companies into research for whom one or two hundred pounds per book is acceptable? The title I'm talking about is a bit over 200 pages with an 8-page colour plate section, so we're not talking Gray's Anatomy here in terms of illustrations and content.

The sums of money involved seem so high that you'd think it would make more sense for a consortium of university libraries to club together and commission a couple of hundred technical titles per year. Approach authors directly, then hire a few people like Anna (=Snowbooks' secret weapon) to tidy up their manuscripts, typeset them and design covers, and then maybe POD print them as you need them. Because they're academic titles you could get them checked for technical accuracy using a peer-review approach. Seems like you'd save heaps of money, and the lower price-tag might even allow for even more esoteric topics to be covered.

In the meantime, I'll wait until this &pound;130 title appears in a dump-bin at Blackwells for &pound;4 in a year or two.","","","","2011-02-11","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","7"

So, anyone clamouring for Emma to get back to them about something or to hurry up and do her homework should be aware that she's had a very disrupted week. Emma's little boy, the normally indomitable Rowan, has had a middle-ear infection that got bad enough to need an operation. Apparently kids get these things quite often, but it was news to me, so I was helpfully fretting and twisting my hat in my hands. I think it's safe to say that Rowan has not enjoyed going without food and water and having needles stuck in him, presumably all accompanied by spectacular ear-ache, and plainly doesn't understand why we'd all gang up on him like this. Em, who seems quite fond of Rowan from what I can tell, has hardly dared to blink for three days, never mind actually sleep. Fortunately Rowan has had his operation, is mending well, is eating voraciously and is on track to be home by the weekend, if all goes well. So, if there's anything you need, you could either try asking me (no, seriously. I mean you could try) or perhaps you could sit on it until next week when hopefully Rowan, and therefore Emma, will be back to full strength.","","","","","2011-03-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

I'm getting the hang of writing headlines; there's no doubting it now. So, Amanda Hocking has been used as an example of a self-publishing success recently. I'm not sure where that started - and I'm certainly too slovenly to find out - but a hasty Google search showed that she had a piece in <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-02-09-ebooks09_ST_N.htm"">USA Today</a> in early Feb mentioning that she'd given up on finding a publisher and was now selling her self-published eBooks in impressive numbers (450,000 in Jan 2011, apparently). 

A lot of people seem to be using her example to make their point, so Ms. Hocking has just written a blog post giving her views on 'what it all means'. You could <a href=""http://amandahocking.blogspot.com/2011/03/some-things-that-need-to-be-said.html"">nip over there</a> and read it. Or take a chance that I'm summarising it correctly in the following terse phrases: writing success is hard, self-publishing hard, success uncertain whether published or self-published. you can't copy her and expect success any more than you can copy JK Rowling as a guarantee of riches. she's high volume but her books sell for a dollar. publishers not evil but still, it's nice to have self-published ebooks in the world.

And Ms. Hocking may well be right: just because it's possible to self-publish to a high standard and be very successful doesn't mean it will become mainstream or even particularly common. On the other hand, I view it as an increasingly important alternative channel. Whether publishers see themselves in these terms or not, they've always been gatekeepers. And whether they like it or not, authors no longer need to pass through those gates to reach readers.","","","","","2011-03-06","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

In other news, we are out of hospital and Ro is on the mend, although he's still got a temperature. Thanks for the kind words. Last week was hell. Very happy to be home. I still have a fair bit of catching up to do, so thanks for your patience and do feel free to email to nag me.

So Ro is on the mend (no temperature, no pain relief today and was in a chirpy, bobbly mood), thank god. No more hospital, hooray, with its annoying flickering fluorescent light that is slightly out of step with the smoke alarm light just next to it (except for once every 28 minutes when they briefly synchronise. I have stared at that hospital ceiling a lot.) 
And so I thought I'd go to the Independent Publishers Guild conference which is this week. If anyone's going, it would be lovely to see you. I've been a bit of a screenhead for the last few months (believe it or not, those people who are still waiting for me to do things) and haven't seen, you know, humans, that much. I am the sort of person who likes her own company, but when the primary human contact you have are removals men, the milkman (yes, I have one and no, it's not a euphemism), medical staff and worried parents of sick children, I suppose one should make the effort to get out a bit. So I'm looking forward to a mingle. See you there!","","","","","2011-03-07","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

So I'm having a lovely time at the independent publishers guild conference. Although I am sitting on the floor, because it's jam packed. And jabbing on my JabPhone which results in this rather staccato writing style I have suddenly adopted. I've not seen so many people at the conference before - it's a heartening sign that the independent publishing sector is actually thriving.","The sessions are good, naturally (Google doodads, social wassnames, retailer Q&A, and a particularly fine show from the CEO of Quercus, Mark Smith). I say naturally, because the IPG have got rather good at organising this sort of thing and rarely fail to put on a good show. But for me the best bit is the mingling. It's so interesting to talk to fellow publishers - not least because it makes me realize that publishing is about far more than trade fiction. Hearing how theologians use the feedback of twitter followers to improve the layout of their footnotes and reference is brilliant. And how a history publisher decided to launch a sci fi and fantasy imprint because they surveyed their customers via their website, 60% of whom read both history and SFF books. Erm, do any of you lot like, I don't know, theology or chicken-rearing? Should we go into bibles or small animal husbandry pamphlets?)

I have made some new friends, and I've met up with lots of old ones. And because I've been head down of late, working hard and not really getting out much, I realised I've really missed them. I feel quite overwhelmed with how lovely people are and I hereby resolve, the internet, to do more of it. 

And now, back to listening to this speech about Google eBooks. And as a bonus, to entertain the publishing geeks amongst you, here's a delicious <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454"">forum answer</a> I came across when researching how to use GREP styles to style html tags in InDesign, like you do.

It seems awful to post about anything, given the horrifying tsunami events. The thing that amazes me is that the water seems so shallow and slow when it breaks onto the beach, and then just builds and builds until it's knocking down hospitals and derailing trains. The footage is heartbreaking. 

And yet, I post, about inconsequential shallow things. Sorry.

I have taken delivery of a pair of Vibram Five Fingers. They are barefoot running shoes, which look like foot-gloves (there's a 'finger' for each of your toes). The idea is that by wearing big padded normal running shoes, you insulate your feet from feedback, and they get flabby and useless. They can't do their job of telling the body what it needs to know to maintain good posture and avoid problems in the road ahead. And they can't use all their muscles properly. Hence, barefoot running is better. But who wants to tread in dog poo / on broken glass / on boiling hot tarmac in the summer? Which is why someone cleverly invented these very interesting shoes. 

I will let you know how I get on with them. I ran 100 yards in them today, which was enough, and was astounded at how bouncy my knees went - I think the body's natural suspension gets called into play when you don't have artificial padding. But the interesting thing is how I found out about them. There's a book that Rob lent me, called Born to Run, which is a hugely engaging tale of one runner's quest to find a way to run without knackering his knees and back. The upshot is that the book is one long advert, in a completely accidental way, for these shoes. I suspect that more than half of people who read the book buy the shoes. 

Thinks. What a great book - that not only delivers a cracking story but has an eighty quid upsell. I wonder if we could do that? Buy this zombie book, and see sales of cricket bats soar, that sort of thing. Interesting, anyway.","","","","","2011-03-12","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

This is not one of those face-palm, god why do I still do things wrong posts. This is a smug post, listing a few things that I have learned, and act upon, which improve my life. 

Thing the first: you're going to have to repeat every task. Even when I think it's a one-off, 90% of the time I end up doing it again. This is just life. What makes it tolerable is that as a result I tend to automate, at least in part, every task I do when I do it for the first time. It's a lot less soul-destroying to revisit something if it takes a fraction of the time the second time around. It's taken me a long time to learn this lesson but it's finally sunk in. 

Thing the second: feed your demons. A friend gave me a book called exactly that. It's a different approach to dealing with inner conflict - rather than repressing or disliking bits of you that are negative (anger, guilt, stress etc) you face them head on, figure out what that part of you actually wants and give it to yourself. Then the demons turn into daemons - a friendly sort of ally. I am fully aware that this reads like a load of hippy clap-trap, but it works and it's wiser than self-hate. 

Thing the third: don't hold back on the coffee. Of all the vices in the world, it's not so bad.

Hmm, I wonder. I was just reading on the internets about a person going on a writer's retreat, and getting a lot of writing done. Me, I don't write. Dear god, let you be thankful. It's the blessing/curse of the publisher - to be frequently exposed to writing so fine it would make a grown man weep, writing of a standard you could never hope to reach, so why bother. 

However, whilst I don't write, I do like to learn new things and I have a current techie interest which would really benefit from a few days' absorbed, quiet thinking and concentration. I wonder: is one allowed to go on a retreat which isn't a writer's retreat? Or could I just say I was writing, and secretly do this other thing instead? Would anyone miss me for, I don't know, 4 or 5 days? More relevantly: could I resist the urge to check my email for a full working week?","","","","","2011-03-23","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","7"

It might be the nice-smelling daffodils on my desk that fills me with an urge to spring clean, but the house is looking pretty tidy, so I shall direct my urges in Snowbooks' direction. Here is an update on what's going on, where we currently are with a bunch of things, and so on. Do <a href=""mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"">shout</a> with questions. If nothing else, we pride ourselves on openness, even when it really hurts (remember <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/10/trust_issues.html#more"">this</a>?) so here goes, a warts and all update. You wouldn't find the following sort of thing on any other publishers' website. Bet you 20.","It's not so much that I took my eye off the ball during the events of the last year (divorce, fling, <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/10/announcement.html#more"">revelations</a>, shutting down <a href=""http://www.onixcentral.com/"">Onix Central</a>, Ro's manky <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/03/poorly.html"">ear</a> and so on) - more that the bloody ball kept bouncing around so fast it was tricky to keep track of it. Things are a lot more settled now. I still have a very busy work schedule, because I work two jobs, essentially: Snowbooks, and <a href=""http://www.snowangels.org"">Snowangels</a>. This isn't entirely through necessity, although I do have to pay the bills - I love the technical data-oriented work that Snowangels brings. I've been getting more and more enjoyment from code: it's certain, conforms to rules, brings order. It doesn't take a psychology graduate to see why I might find that sort of thing attractive. So one of my projects at the moment is to develop in Ruby on Rails. More on that another time, perhaps. On the plus side, Ro is now pretty much full-time at a lovely pre-school, where he has adorable little friends, his own peg, and where he charms the ladies and postman. And things in general are looking up up up. Anyway, so. Nightmare year, in summary, and a busy work schedule.

Which is why it's handy that we did all the work we've done over the years to automate as much of the publishing process as we can. The last major outstanding area is the production of eBooks, which we're working on now. Many other things we have down pat: typesetting, print file production, sales, website and catalogue production etc. Regarding sales, we work with the inestimably wonderful Allison and Busby team who manage our sales and chase me at the relevant times for the relevant things. 

With print, though, things have been more tricky. We had a pretty major hiccup recently with the demise of our sole printers JF Print earlier this year. The printers formerly known as Haynes, based in Sparkford, went into administration, with a bunch of our books on the line. It didn't take too long to find a new printer (CPI), but it did take a while to figure out what stock had been printed, what needed reprinting, what files the new printer needed etc. I'm pleased to report that everything that should be at the printer is at the printer, and proofs are on the way to me. 

I took that bookkeeping and accounting course to get more expert with the actual gubbins of running a business. I've had a lot of hands on practice, obviously, over the years, but I really wanted to know - rather than hope I knew - what I was doing. <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/03/bloody_hell.html"">93%</a>. That's all I'm saying. 

And to that end, I can report that our financial position is, well, let's call it 'fine'. You're only as good as your last month's sales, of course, but just at the moment we have about twenty grand in the bank. We owe about nine grand to various suppliers over the next couple of months. And we are currently owed about twenty grand from book sales, and an additional bunch from other sources such as foreign rights.
Snowangels sales go through the Snowbooks accounts, but they are not included in these figures. 
  
Another area of ongoing work is royalties. The last two royalty runs, as some of my authors will no doubt attest, have been a bloody nightmare. This is because I migrated to a new system - one Onix Central Publishing Manager (which lives on, it appears, as <a href=""http://www.thebookengine.net"">The Book Engine</a>, but not with our blessing. In fact, Rob, I recall that you came up with that name, didn't you? Which is why you and I already owned the domain name <a href=""http://www.thebookengine.co.uk"">TheBookEngine.co.uk</a>. Tsk). The system works for title management but when I started to use it, I discovered it had a fundamentally non-functional royalties module. Through gritted teeth, late into many nights, muttering oaths, Filemaker manual in hand, I fixed the thing, although I still don't like it. Whilst I was trying to fix it, I manually calculated royalties for those authors I thought might be owed money and did an interim payment to them, but it doesn't excuse the fact that the statements were late. My medium term plan is to write another royalties system - one I know is solid and robust and, ooh, how about this, functional - but in the meantime the situation is resolved, at least temporarily, by my patches. 

The next area we're going to look at is distribution. We're moving distributor in the summer to sort out our eBook dissemination and to take advantage of a decent POD programme for backlist books that fall out of print, as well as to save money on the deal. More on that when I've signed the contract!

Wowsers. I've just managed to really upset and annoy one of our authors, who received her royalty statements and payment late in the last period. I've ended up reverting her rights because she's so annoyed. 

I thought I'd just repeat my huge apologies, publicly this time, to our other authors who had to bear with me whilst I struggled to get the royalty system I'd switched to up and running. As you know it's been a tricky year but that's no excuse for letting our authors down. 

If I've learned anything, it's this. If an author gets a statement late, they don't just see an administrative hiccup. They see delays as disrespectful to their hard work and insensitive to their feelings. I can understand that because authors put their souls into their writing. So I'll be very sure to prepare statements well ahead of time in the future. 

And if you're one of our authors, and are really cross with me for any reason, *please* do <a href=""mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"">let me know now</a>, so I can sort out the issue.","","","","","2011-03-29","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","1"

Thanks for the comments on the state of the nation post, below. There were a couple of questions, as well as pretty universal interest in our eBook plans. I'll cover eBooks tomorrow, but in the meantime, here's my response to Wayne's question about retailers.","Wayne asked: ""One thing I'm curious to hear more on is your perspective on how the situation with booksellers today, ie: Waterstone's scaling back etc., has affected indie publishers? Do you think that booksellers in general are more likely to cut back on lesser known genre authors in favour of stocking another shelf with the Kings and Nesbos and Larssons of this world?""

Thanks for the question, Wayne. It's a good one, but it's not a new one. Since we started, every month I've thought 'phew, another month when [insert retailer name] has kindly selected our books for promotion / listed them in range / maintained their stocking levels. But next month is bound to be harder!' 

Getting a book accepted into range or onto promotion is always a big deal, and it's Snowbooks' primary aim in publishing. Getting a book into a good spot in a chain bookstore is, rather obviously, a very good way to sell it, and the effort we put in to achieving this is much greater than the effort we go to to get newspaper reviews, to plan launch parties, or to attend literary festivals. (In other words, we put close to zero effort into those things that, based on our experience, we know to have a close to zero effect on sales, and masses of effort into retailers.) 

We have always been lucky with our books. Retailers have supported us enormously well. I hope, however, more often than not, retailers don't have to make a choice between maximising margin per linear foot and listing indie titles. Indies provide the same discounts as larger publishers; the same promotional support; the same returns agreements. We provide depth to a range, and give the retailer a genuine chance to get behind new writing. Snowbooks' covers look the part and our writing is as good as it gets, so it's not exactly a charitable effort on the part of the retailers to list our books. 

I don't see a significant difference in the last 12 months to the last 8 years. It's always an achievement to get books into retailers. It's as hard, or easy, as it ever was. I'd say that our covers help enormously, and the fact that our books do in fact deliver sales. 

And remember, Larsson is published by an indie!","","","","2011-03-30","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","4"

I read an interesting observation about self-publishing by Bruce Sterling the other day on his fun (but scrappy) <a href=""http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2011/04/web-semantics-bad-writing-doesnt-matter-any-more/"">blog</a>. He was picking up on something that Roxanne Gay said on <a href=""http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/taking-no-for-an-answer-some-new-thoughts-on-self-publishing/"">HTML Giant</a>. We all know that publishers act as gatekeepers and quality filters in the world of books. Having read a few DIYed novels, Roxanna says: ""<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">...theres a reason most of those self-published books were not picked up by publishers great or small. There was no misunderstood genius in these novels. These books fell through the proverbial cracks for a reason.</span>""

But Sterling's <a href=""http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2011/04/web-semantics-bad-writing-doesnt-matter-any-more/"">response</a> was this: ""<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">So gatekeepers are good because they separate the wheat from the chaff, etc. etc. There is a major point missing from this argument: readers dont care. Bad, unpublishable books are finding an audience. I cannot claim to have read many of the books on the Kindle self-published bestseller list, but without a doubt there are many books that some people would find totally inept, but are finding an audience with many honest 5-star reviews.</span>""

Interesting idea, no? We're protecting readers from dross, and sometimes they don't want us to. I'd say it was tricky to argue that we should do it anyway without ending up sounding patronising.","","","","","2011-04-10","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","8"

Aren't colds weird. Finally, I am coughing and sneezing this morning and it's such a relief. The last few days I have appeared perfectly well, but have felt dreadful. Example: there's a personal cheque for 1500 sitting on my piano, which is the returned deposit for my old rented house. I have felt so under the weather that I simply could not be bothered to go to the piano, get the cheque, put it in an envelope and post it to my bank. So if you've had any sort of email from me this week, or have evidence that I've done any work at all, you should count yourself very lucky. (And imaginary, since I know I've done bugger all. Sorry about that.) 

However, phew, today all the germs, picked up no doubt from the aircraft hanger full of infection and disease that is LBF, have got themselves busy manifesting themselves in coughs and splutters rather than messing with my head, so I am back on form. All the things that need doing will get done today. Hooray! I am competent once more!

Some unrelated bits and bobs:
* <strong>Multitaskers struggle to... ?</strong>
When someone says to me, ""Keep talking; I *am* listening,"" while they do something else I've never been too impressed with the results. Anecdotally and over-generalistically, I get the impression that many under-20s never do just *one* thing: if they're watching TV, they're also on FaceBook or playing a game. Wasn't like that in my day, harrumph (though I'm a low-level multi-tasker myself). Obviously if you multi-task you're unlikely to do any one of your activities as well as a single-tasker, but you're also constantly challenging your brain to cope with multiple inputs, so I was interested to read this <a href=""http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/04/its-not-just-rude-its-ruining-your-brain"">discussion of a study</a> which tried to work out what new mental skills multi-taskers had acquired. The answer amused me. (<a href=""http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/04/its-not-just-rude-its-ruining-your-brain"">link</a>)
* <strong>Bugs</strong>
I read a lot more non-fiction than fiction. I may not be making my soul more beautiful with this choice, but I certainly learn a lot more stuff about the world. I'm still at the very early stages of reading a book about MRSA at the moment (=<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Superbug/dp/B003YRJBME/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1303283917&sr=8-2"">Superbug</a>). It's terrifying so far and is likely to turn me into a Howard Hughes-style recluse. Well-written, interesting and full of very unwelcome information. Do your best to avoid it.
* <strong>Farewell</strong>
And finally something that makes me sad: Lis Sladen, the lady who played Sarah-Jane Smith on Doctor Who - both when I was little and in the last few years - has died from cancer. I was so surprised because she always looked so fantastic that I thought she must be fit as a flea. I can't remember ever seeing a woman in her sixties look so great in a pair of jeans and a leather jacket and I loved the character she played. I think you can often tell when an actor is really a great person and no one seems to have had a bad word to say about Lis Sladen.  (I would have spelled her name 'Liz' but I'm seeing it as 'Lis' in newspaper stories.)

I had one really great English teacher in high school and several excellent professors in college, all of whom drove home the importance of proper grammar and punctuation.  Im so lucky to get the chance to work with authors who put together amazing stories that are, for the most part (like 98.5%) really well written.  I dont have to do a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to editing; Im able to focus mainly on punctuation and issues of clarity.  I hope our authors wont mind me saying this, but as good as they are with words, I add and remove a LOT of commas.  I make a LOT of tiny little changes to things that appear, I presume, because not everybody had those teachers and professors that made prescriptive grammar a priority.

So Im going to write a series of posts here with pointers on the errors I see most frequently.  Not just to make my life easier, should any of our authors take these tips to heart, but because the world is just a prettier place with proper punctuation.  (But alliteration sort of gets on ones nerves.)

The best place to start is the error I see most often: commas missing from compound sentences  and commas used to splice sentences that are NOT compound.","So, what makes a traditional sentence?  A subject and a verb.  <i>I ran.  You eat. Teddy drove.</i>  Pretty basic, right?  A <b>compound sentence</b> is one that has two of these subject-verb phrases (aka two sentences), separated by a conjunction: <i>I ran, <b>and</b> Teddy drove</i>.  The most common conjunctions are <i>and, but, or</i> (for more valuable information on conjunctions, watch <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkO87mkgcNo>this important film</a>).

Any time you can identify two (or more!) subject-verb phrases separated by a conjunction, you have to use a comma.  

Incorrect: The grey sky rumbled with thunder and I regretted having forgotten an umbrella.

<b>Correct: The grey sky rumbled with thunder, and I regretted having forgotten an umbrella.</b>

Its not as simple as <i>I ran, and Teddy drove.</i> -- but the basic structure is still there: <i>The sky rumbled, and I regretted.</i>  Its finding that subject and verb thats going to tell you whether you need a comma.

Now, if youve only got one subject, youre no longer putting two sentences together.  A simple example of this would be <i>Teddy drove and texted.</i> (No, Teddy! Dont do that!)  Obviously, <i>texted</i> isnt a sentence on its own; I dont think any of us would argue that.  But people love to put a comma before that <i>and</i>, perhaps in a fit of hypercorrection.

Heres a less obvious example:

Incorrect: The grey sky rumbled with thunder, and made me regret having forgotten an umbrella.

<b>Correct: The grey sky rumbled with thunder and made me regret having forgotten an umbrella.</b>

Unlike the compound sentence example, this one only has a single subject.  <i>The sky rumbled and made.</i>

Most rules have their exceptions, but youre not going to go wrong by following this one.  I often see commas used in non-compound sentences because the phrases have gotten too long and confusing.  Sometimes theres no way around this, but if youre going to write, write well.  Dont rely on incorrectly placed commas as a crutch for lazy language.  Whip that sentence into shape!","","","grammar","2011-05-25","2013-03-29","","","","Anna","13"

Life would be so much easier if we didnt have to, like, <i>talk</i> to people.  Both in writing and in real life.  (Ha, ha!  Only kidding!  Im not a recluse who works from home and avoids exposure to the burning Day Star!)  Here are a few tips for addressing and referring to people in text.

When you (or your characters, in dialogue) speak to somebody, the convention is to put a comma before the name.  For example: <i>Go to the bakery and get me a chocolate-glazed donut, Rob.</i>  This is an issue of clarity -- and a fairly important one, as a missing comma can often turn the preceding words into a string of adjectives describing the persons name.  That is, you switch from talking <i>to</i> somebody to talking <i>about</i> him.  And I dont think the bakery makes a donut Rob, much less one with chocolate icing.","Speaking of icing, my high school English teacher (a huge stickler for proper grammar) used to joke that he had tubes of icing for birthday cakes that were brought into the office.  <i>Happy Birthday Joan</i> became <i>Happy Birthday, Joan</i> under his watch.  Thats correct usage, and if youre writing dialogue where one character greets another, youll want to stick to this rule.  <i>Hello, Miguel. Good afternoon, Grandfather.</i>

The exception is in written correspondence - either in e-mails or, say, in a letter your character is writing.  In this case, we write <i>Dear John,</i> or <i>Hello Yasmine,</i> and then carry on with the body of the message.

Since we were wishing Grandfather a good afternoon just a second ago, it would also be useful to explain when to capitalize those pesky familial relations.  Basically, if you can replace <i>Mom, Dad</i>, or <i>Auntie</i> with a persons name, you should use a capital letter.  For example: <i>Im going to the store with Mom.</i>  You could just as easily say <i>Im going to the store with Frances.</i>  When you can substitute in a name, the word in question is functioning as a <b>proper noun</b>, which means it should be capitalized.

The clue that you should <b>not</b> use a capital letter is the word <i>my</i>.  <i>My mom, my dad, my auntie.</i>  You wouldnt say <i>Im going to the store with my Frances.</i>  (Well you might, colloquially, but were talking non-cutesy language here.)  <i>My</i> turns <i>mom</i> into a regular noun, which takes a lowercase letter.    The same goes for any other possessive pronoun (eg, <i><b>her</b> father, <b>your</b> grandma,</i> etc.).

There you go!  Thats how you address and refer to people.  Now you can finally write a book that doesnt feature a misanthropic, orphaned hermit as the protagonist.","","","grammar","2011-06-02","2013-03-29","","","","Anna","2"

After the first installment of this grammar series, it seemed like there were a lot of people commenting on the usage of semi-colons.  And not in a gosh, those semi-colons are confusing little beasts way but in more of an I sure love semi-colons; they are the best! way.  Thats because people who know how to correctly use a semi-colon <i>love</i> to do so; they want to make sure everybody knows of their great skill.  And <i>that</i> is because people who know how to correctly use a semi-colon are superior human beings.  Thats a fact.  A science fact.

Fear not, intrepid writer -- you too can easily learn to wield the semi-colon with confidence, and then you will become more desirable to the mate of your choosing.","Weve already covered what constitutes a sentence in the lesson on <a href= http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/05/annas_grammar_pointers_1.html>compound sentences</a>.  What about when you want to join up two related subject-verb phrases, but youve completely used up your supply of conjunctions for the month?  Blammo!  Semi-colon!  See it in action:

<b>Example 1: I wanted to go out for dinner, but Henry said hed rather stay in.</b>

<b>Example 2: I wanted to go out for dinner; Henry said hed rather stay in.</b>

You cant just take out the conjunction (which is <i>but</i> in Example 1) and leave the comma.  A comma alone is not powerful enough to separate two sentences!  I see that error very often, and its wrong.  Two sentences and no conjunction requires a semi-colon.

The key to using a semi-colon <b>appropriately</b> is choosing sentences that <i>could</i> stand apart from one another but which are related in theme.  In the above example, both sentences have to do with dinner plans.  This usage makes much less sense:

<b>Im writing a post on grammar; I was five when I got my first pet cat.</b>

Sure, theyre both about me, but theres just no call for a semi-colon.  However, I can say, <i>Im writing a post on grammar; its something about which I can be slightly pedantic.</i>  You can see the relationship between those two ideas, right?

Often, writers use semi-colons to avoid lulling their audience to sleep with the constant rhythm of compound sentences.  Or the similar, tedious clack-clack-clack that a string of simple sentences can achieve.  This is something we should all try to avoid; knowledge of different sentence constructions leads to more interesting writing.

Other times, youll just want to join up two related sentences (either for clarity or, again, for the sake of rhythm) that wouldnt make sense with a conjunction. <i>Im writing a post on grammar; its something about which I can be slightly pedantic.</i> is a good example of this.  I would struggle to link those two sentences with a conjunction (and have it not sound silly), but having them stand alone with a full stop between would be jarring.

So, to review: there should be a complete subject-verb sentence on either side of a semi-colon, and the sentences in question should have a logical connection.  I sometimes see writers get tripped up when it comes to choosing between semi-colons and full-blown colons, but that will have to be a topic for another post.","","","grammar","2011-06-08","2013-03-29","","","","Anna","6"

My macbook pro is no longer with us, I'm sorry to say. Or, at least, it won't stay switched on. I've spent an uncomfortable day in Milton Keynes (why? why so many roundabouts? and don't all those people have jobs to go to?) which houses the nearest Apple store. They put a new hard drive in and said it was fine, but it ain't. So I'm going to buy a new computer tomorrow so I can send this one off for an extended fixin' holiday, and restore from backup, which just happens to be completely bang up to date. I find that one loses a significant amount of work due to spontaneous computer failure just the once, in each lifetime.  

Anyway, temporary glitch, but apologies if you've emailed and I haven't replied. I will do as soon as I'm back in the land of the computing. Hooray for time machine backups and cloud based version control, that's what I say, which makes this a hiccup not a monumental disaster.","","","","","2011-06-20","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

This not having a working computer lark is interesting. On the downside: NO COMPUTER. On the plus side, I have talked (rather than emailed) to more people than I usually do, and I've gone in more shops. It was rather nice to go into the Waterstone's in Milton Keynes and see that Thomas Emson's Maneater took pride of place on the Waterstone's Recommends gondola end in the SFF section. It was also nice to talk to people in store and check that all was well with ordering and systems. The Waterstone's in Oxford was also looking rather chipper, and I saw a good stocking of our titles both in section and a couple on the tables: Pandemonium Road by Thomas Emson and Write to be Published by Nicola Morgan both looked dazzling. 

As I type (on an old Mac Book that Rob has kindly lent me), my new Mac Mini purchased this morning is restoring from backup, and my macbook pro is being couriered to the fixers to have a new logic board (I'm told). The restore from backup has been a bit hairy: I had to reformat* the time machine external disk, and so have gained a few grey hairs today. All seems ok now. Hopefully I'll be back on my proper system this evening, with email and all. Thanks for your patience on email whilst I get sorted out.

So, there's this programming language, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29"">Ruby</a>, written by a Japanese man in the 1990s. It's neat: it incorporates all the best bits of other languages and it follows the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment"">principle of least astonishment</a>. All in all, if you use Ruby you get to be productive *and* have fun. 

Then in 2004 a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson"">Danish man</a> used Ruby to write a website project he was working on. The particular way he designed the code, he realised, would be useful for other projects - it provided a solid framework which helped with all the basics of how a website works, like creating, updating and deleting data records, and keeping all the different bits of a website in the right place. So he made it open source so other programmers could use it. And use it they did, because it was so handy. A global following sprung up, and the framework kept growing and developing and getting better and better. This framework is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails"">Ruby on Rails</a> and I am obsessed with it.","Let's recap. I am an archaeology graduate. I run a publishing company. In proper all-girl's-school tradition, I have been conditioned to believe I am no good at maths or science or technical things. And yet a proper grown-up programming language and a major web development framework are bringing me huge amounts of enjoyment, and I'm good at using them. What's going on here? 

For a start, learning things nowadays is a very different kettle of fish to learning things when I wor a lass. When I'm working on programming, I look something up on the internet at least once every half an hour. And when I'm really stuck, I post a question on one of the many Rails forums and I generally get an answer from a community member within the hour. 

That's not to say that you have to be all internet-oriented. I have a large pile of books next to me on my desk which provide comprehensive guides to both Ruby and Rails. Publishing companies which publish computer manuals are generally so cool. Some of them have their works in progress published online, where readers can get a sneak preview and also add edits and comments as the book's being written. 

What about the motivation? It's not dissimilar to why I like creating books. Programming makes me a problem-solver and a maker. I can get absorbed in the detail of solving a particular problem. And I can take pride in the resultant code, knowing I've approached the problem with rigour and solved it in a thoughtful way. 

As for what I'm building in Rails, well, I'll tell you later, no doubt. For the time being, I'm just loving the journey.","","","","2011-06-27","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

Do you know what my problem with misplaced commas is?  Its that, while Im reading text in my head, I cant help taking a pause where the comma indicates, yet my brain <i>knows</i> that its wrong.  Sort of the same way I have to read the misspelling <i>definately</i> as def-i-NATE-ly.  (English-writing wordsmiths of the world: it is spelled <i>definitely</i>.  Definitely.  Think of the word <i>finite</i>.  De-finite-ly.)

Anyway, two incorrect comma usages which are like nails on a blackboard to me are commas placed before verbs and before the word <i>that</i>.

The former is most often a case, I believe, of sentences getting out of control.  I think we would all agree that a sentence should read <i>Subject verb.</i> and not <i>Subject, verb.</i>  (Think <i>I ran.</i> versus <i>I, ran.</i>)  But when you start loading up that subject with a bunch of extra words, things can get pretty confusing by the time you get around to picking a verb.  So its a case of comma-as-crutch, really.  Youre basically saying, Hey, were all confused by this sentence.  So heres a comma - lets take a breather and come back when were ready to continue.","<b>Incorrect Example: The park bench that I usually preferred, was covered in bird poo today.</b>

Thats a pretty bare-bones example, but I wouldnt be surprised to see that mistake made.  You might also see it happen if the subject contained several nouns.

<b>Incorrect Example: The book, an apple, four chess pieces, and a very lazy cat, were all cluttering the surface of the desk.</b>

Its like Ive accidentally started a comma sequence I just cant stop once I get to <i>cat</i> and move on to the verb (the comma before the <i>and</i> is a separate issue and differs between US and UK conventions).  

Obviously, there are times when a comma will <b>correctly</b> fall before the verb in a sentence, such as when it's being used in a clause separate from the main subject and verb.  Generally speaking, however, its a good idea not to let too many words slip between your subject and verb.  If you find that you have to take a breather before you carry on with the verb portion of a sentence, perhaps look instead to see if clarity would be better achieved with a rewrite.

Now - commas and <i>that</i>.  They do not mix.  Microsoft Words grammar checker has but a few simple goals in life.  First, point out every sentence fragment in your document; second, suggest ridiculous rewordings to avoid the passive voice; third, freak out whenever somebody puts a comma before <i>which</i>.  So heres the deal with <i>that</i> versus <i>which</i>.

Its a matter of restrictive clauses and nonrestrictive clauses.  A restrictive clause is one that is essential for distinguishing the noun in question.

<b>Example: I chose the copy that had the least damage to its cover.</b>

The information in a restrictive clause is essential, so it doesnt use commas.  It <b>restricts</b> the noun to being only the one that fits the conditions set by the clause.  In the example above, I didnt choose the copy with the second-to-least amount of damage; I chose the one that had <i>the least</i>.  Traditionally, <i>that</i> has been used with restrictive clauses, but the use of <i>which</i> is also commonly accepted these days (so take that, Word).

A nonrestrictive clause provides additional information about a noun - information that isnt necessary for identification.  

<b>Example: I chose the mint-condition copy, which also happened to be the most expensive of the three.</b>

We use commas with nonrestrictive clauses; it marks them as asides, rather than essential information.  Heres the important part: nonrestrictive clauses always use <i>which</i> -- NOT <i>that</i>.  It is never correct to write <i>I chose the mint-condition copy, that also happened to be the most expensive of the three.</i>  Because <i>that</i> is used solely with restrictive clauses, you should never (under ordinary circumstances) see a comma precede it.

So the next time youre scouring your writing for errors, pause any time you see a comma occurring before a verb or the word <i>that</i>.  Youll definitely run into exceptions to these rules, but those commas should serve as red flags, indicating either an out-and-out error or an opportunity to reword for clarity.","","","grammar","2011-07-01","2013-03-29","","","","Anna","2"

Try a quick Google search and it's fairly obvious that the e-book avalanche that has long been predicted is well underway. As you know, Amazon already make more from e-book sales than from paperbacks. And while the billions of paper books in the world aren't suddenly going to go away, there's no denying that a book that's released today or a decade from now will face a very different commercial landscape than it would have a decade in the past.","For a start, the ever-lower barriers to entry in e-books will mean even more titles get published* - potentially a lot more - and there were already more new books in one year than any of us could read in a lifetime. There's also the dwindling of the book chains to consider. Both in the US and the UK there are fewer nationwide book outlets, which means fewer places where customers can view an array of new and recent titles carefully arranged according to quality, sales expectation and those generous 'bungs' known as 'marketing support'. When you walked into Borders, you knew that any book you saw within the first five seconds was destined for greatness (or at least a big marketing push). If you didn't have time to trawl every shelf in the store, you could just peruse the displays, glance at the tables and see what was stacked by the counters. That way you'd see all the blockbusters and the hot new releases without fear that you'd miss anything important. But the world of e-books is like a Borders store that runs to seventy floors and all but a hundred titles are arranged on identical shelves. Differentiating your title from the pack has always been difficult; it's going to become a lot harder.

The other point I wanted to make about the world in the age of e-books is that we haven't really started yet. I've complained before about how a Kindle download of a million-selling title from the New York Times list can be badly typeset, with weird characters that display wrongly on certain devices. Such a thing in the print version is almost inconceivable. And at the bottom end of the market the situation resembles the early days of the web when flashing text, animated rainbows and a hilarious jumble of fonts, colours and backgrounds were the norm. I bought a cheap e-book recently where the hundreds of footnotes had been randomly blended in with the body text so you couldn't tell which was which,  everything was in the same unprofessional-looking format (= fully justified with no hyphenation). It was unreadable chaos - but it was on sale through the Amazon store.

Likewise with e-book devices. Many people don't notice bad typesetting once they're caught up in a story, but they will notice awkardly placed buttons for turning the page or (in my case) a process for downloading new books that only works about one time in ten when there's a wifi network to join first. 

We're still in the early days of e-book software and e-book devices. They're going to get better. A lot better. They're going to get cool. In five years the good ones will be amazing. And at the bottom end they're also going to get really cheap. They'll get like digital watches, which were exotic luxuries in 1975 and given away with petrol by 1995. Soon, when you take out an over-50s insurance policy, instead of a cheap carriage clock you'll get an e-reader and a thousand 'classic' books on it.

For the time being, complex layouts don't really work in e-books, or large formats, or colours, or high-quality pictures (and actually footnotes and nice typesetting aren't really there either). So for now, coffee table books will be paper, as will textbooks (the kind with pictures and diagrams) and Dorling-Kindersley-style publications. Mass-market paperbacks, on the other hand, have very little to offer the world in their paper incarnation and will be largely gobbled up by e-books. But all the items in that previous list will one day soon be possible and practical electronically. And that's before we push past replicating what a paper textbook can do and introduce some innovation (as I've said before, I'm waiting for the day you can wire up a circuit or do an experiment with a pendulum <em>inside the textbook</em>). 

In summary: this is not the world of e-books. This is just the beginning.

As you know, I'm one of those people who think you can discern occasional omens about the future of books by pawing through the entrails of the music and movie industries. I found this <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/daniel-eks-spotify-musics-last-best-hope-07142011.html"">Businessweek article</a> about the rise of Spotify very interesting on that score. Because Spotify (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"">Wikipedia entry</a>) lets people listen to lots of different music, often for free, it was a struggle to get the big music companies on board with it. But one of the juicier carrots the Spotify folks could dangle in front of sceptical music-biz execs was the banquet of data their service could offer about who is listening to which songs, where and when. Moreover, their data allows them to look at what effect promotional efforts are having in real time, while their artist is on that talk show or their Super Bowl ad is running. Imagine the possibilities.","Now, perhaps I'm being doing them an injustice, but 'data hungry' isn't a term I would apply to most of the publishing industry. I'm probably being unfair, but I often meet publishing folk who want less analysis, innovation and clever marketing. They want the world of books to calm down (and ideally go backwards a bit), not whizz off into the future. And (again, I'm probably being unfair) I think many publishing folk would rather exercise their own personal judgement about which titles to commission and promote rather than be led around by what the 'usage data' from their books might tell them they should be doing. But, be that as it may, what has happened with Spotify is possible (and probably already happens to a limited extent) with e-books. When enough readers buy their books electronically, we'll be able to watch their reading whims in real-time. In theory you could get so granular that you could buy ad-space on a single bus-stop in Reading and watch to see what that does to local sales (at different times of the day, even!). And you could look at charts showing you the point in a book when the maximum number of readers abandoned it. Or who stayed up until 3am to finish it - and then downloaded the sequel. If that data were at least partially anonymised obtaining info of that sort might not even seem overly voyeuristic. 

Publishing is not alone in treating each sale as a success - even if the reader later regretted their purchase - because gathering usable feedback has been so difficult. It'll be interesting, once we're in a position to know a great deal more about what our readers like, want and genuinely enjoy to see what we do with that information.","","","","2011-07-20","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

[trumpets end]","The website - well, really, the online system which generates it - has been about six months in the making, ever since Rob waved a red book at me which looked intriguing. The book was called <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ruby-Rails-Tutorial-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321743121/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1311776265&sr=8-1"">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>.

I have had the *best* time learning Rails - it's been enjoyable to build something out of nothing, and a huge source of pride to do it well.

The result is <a href=""http://www.bibliocloud.com"">Bibliocloud</a> - an online system which contains all our bibliographic, title, contract, sales, print, contributor and marketing data. I've also just run this period's royalties, rather successfully, through it. (I've linked to the site, but there's no point in going there yet - there's nowt to see unless you have a sign-in. Which you don't. And it's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1"">SHA1 hexdigest</a> encrypted, in case anyone's feeling nosy.)

 At some point later in the year we're going to release Bibliocloud as commercial software. You can let me know if you're interested and I can keep you posted. But until it's ready, I'll be running it privately in beta. It's already got a full test suite of 2000 tests, but using it for six months or so will allow me to get it very finely tuned. Only perfection will do. 

Here's a video with a bit of a guided tour. Do shout if you have any feedback, not just on the website but on the data itself. We've always liked automation, but now it really is a question of pressing just one button to update the website as well as our Onix feeds and AIs, so I'm going to be on a bit of a data-update frenzy over the next few weeks.

Have you been watching the Torchwood series Miracle Day? 10 x hour-long episodes comprising a single epic story, made as a joint US/UK production and shown on both sides of the Atlantic. For a writer like ex-Doctor Who top-bod, Russell T Davies, it's an incredible opportunity. What <em>couldn't</em> you do with a canvas like that to express yourself upon? More than that, he's been able to rope in writers like Jane Espenson (of Buffy and BSG fame) and assemble a cast with quite a few impressive names in it. If successful, it could open the way to lots of UK-originated shows making it to the US and perhaps some of their talent working here. Lots of possibilities; lots of opportunities. Or course none of that is likely to happen, given that the whole thing is rubbish.

(Only read on if you've seen the first nine of the ten episodes as there are big, blatant spoilers.)","It's nicely shot and acceptably acted (with a few flat spots and occasional howlers). But to what extent does the story we're being told make the blindest bit of sense? Or even obey its own rules?

Take, for example, episode 9. Half the episode revolves around keeping Gwen's persistently-vegetative dad safe from SWAT teams. Is there any reason to think her father will recover? Well, if there is, they haven't shared it with the viewers. From what we can tell, he's still breathing (because of the miracle) but in all other ways he's dead and gone. If there's a reason to think otherwise - and thus a reason for the viewer to care about him - we need to be told - which we haven't been. So why is it important to 'save' him? Granted, the authorities would burn him if they got hold of him, but that's what they used to do with dead bodies which <em>weren't</em> breathing, so now that corpses continue to respire is there anything wrong with cremating them once higher brain functions have ceased? The scandal is that borderline cases are being burnt as well, but that's not what Gwen is devoting her time to. (Except she did blow up a building a while back - did she kill the workers inside? was the camp instantly replaced? where did she get the bomb and the motorbike from?)

We're told that resources are scarce, the social fabric is coming apart and there are shortages of everything. But that hasn't affected the Category One Police. They still have the manpower, equipment and resources to mount raids on any home even suspected of harbouring a peacefully-respiring comatose OAP. Why? What's the urgency? Couldn't those police be tackling the decline of law and order throughout the land? It's not obvious why rounding up Gwen's dad gets the same sort of attention as international terrorism - except that the Needs of Drama require armed police to keep bursting in. In a saner world, Gwen's dad seems to be on a par with a house-plant when it comes to his impact on society which surely means the SWAT teams could be deployed elsewhere.

Then there's the business of Jack's blood. Esther (for some reason I still can't remember her name, despite having spent nine hours in her company) has latched onto the fact that Jack's blood might be important to... something... somehow. Jack assures her it's not, but that doesn't bother whatsername (dammit, Esther). Jack is shot; he's injured and bleeding, and his life is in danger, so what does Esther do? She starts draining his blood and storing it in a fridge in cool-looking blood-bags. Why? Well, the obvious answer is that she knows it's going to prove vital in episode 10. But what reason does her character give? She sort of doesn't, from what I can tell.

Similarly why is evil paedophile Oswald tagging along on a Torchwood/CIA mission to Shanghai? They don't trust him, they don't like him and they don't need him; so why smuggle him into China on a secret mission? Well, apparently Gwen had 'no choice' but to bring him. Because otherwise Owen would have killed him. And we wouldn't want that because... Actually, why wouldn't we want that? He's been sentenced to death and Gwen was actively trying to kill him until Owen intervened. To recap: Oswald comes to Gwen's house, Gwen tries to kill him, Owen says ""Let me kill him instead"", then Oswald says ""Take me to Shanghai or Owen will kill me"" and Gwen - and the team - capitulate. Why? Well, again, the reason is clearly because they need him there for episode 10, but that's not the same thing as the Characters Making Any Sense. At All.

In fact the most damning thing I read about this series - and it was from a review which was semi-positive - was that you could just jump in at episode 7 and skip the previous six hours. Of course that was before we found out that most of episode 7 didn't matter either. It was enjoyable to watch:  all about that nice boy Angelo and his affair with Jack. It was a good story, up until Angelo knifed Jack in mid-snog and then allowed him to be chained up and hacked to death for weeks. After that point I felt as though Jack should probably have cooled somewhat towards Angelo, but apparently we were supposed to feel that Jack had actually let Angelo down. In fact, given how peripheral Angelo apparently is to what happens thereafter, the point of the entire Angelo two-parter simply boiled down to telling us that three families knew that Jack was immortal and they'd collected some of his blood. Angelo appears to have been irrelevant.

And given that, I'm still mystified as to why Gwen's family were kidnapped by Olivia Colasanto. It seems that she just wanted to talk. And I'm hazy about how her people hacked into the alien contact lenses - or even knew of their existence. Maybe I need to watch those episodes again (shudder!). But it did give us an opportunity to see that Gwen would sell out Jack with no questions asked in order to save her family. We might have expected that she'd enlist Jack's help in order to rescue her family, but that didn't even seem to occur to her. And we already know that Jack is a scheming liar who will - on occasion - make bargains with the devil. Maybe that whole kidnapping and betrayal episode was just about making sure we didn't get too invested in the survival of our 'heroes'. Which would be the same reason why Rex is unpleasant about 70% of the time.

And finally, I'm still trying to work out the wisdom of giving so much screen time to two characters, Jilly Kitzinger and Oswald Danes, who remain enigmas to us. It's difficult to follow unpleasant characters for two whole months without knowing Why The Hell We Should Care. So far they're both irrelevant (unless Oswald's TV speech really was pivotal - though I didn't quite understand how or why). We have one episode left in which to find out why we've been dutifully paying them any attention since some time back in July. Will they retrospectively become interesting/absorbing?

In fact is there anyone out there who thinks that the final instalment is going to reveal that it all makes brilliant and blinding sense, when all the jigsaw pieces will fall into place, and with hindsight the hours of not-very-much-happening followed by exciting-action-for-confusing-reasons will be revealed as tightly-plotted dramatic <em>gold</em>?

And equally, is there anyone who feels that, given a healthy budget and ten hours of transatlantic primetime television to fill, they couldn't have done better?","","","","2011-09-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Whenever I've said something on this subject in the past there's always been a few people who feel that way.

Commercially speaking, ebooks are huge, but I'm continually struck by how unready they are for the spotlight. There's a long list of things that need to happen before ebooks are ready for widespread popularity - despite the fact that moment has already passed. Bear in mind I've been saying 'the ebooks are coming' for years - and I've been fairly happy about that prospect. But currently we're in an awkward transition phase full of problems which I think should have been ironed out five years ago.

I've blogged before about how some high-profile e-titles are sold in their hundreds of thousands full of formatting and text problems which would be considered a scandal in a print edition. For instance, Kindle editions of Stieg Larsson books contained characters which wouldn't display properly on iPads and iPhones. Can you imagine a situation where a paper edition of a global bestseller had an ellipsis replaced by a row of square boxes? Reviewers would be disgusted and proofreaders would be fired - and possibly sued. The situation is of course far worse in lots of lower profile ebooks.

Ebook pricing is still pretty questionable too - giving rise to situations where a canny shopper can sometimes order a paper book for less than the equivalent download. We're still trying to decide what rights are granted to an ebook owner (and whether we even consider it 'ownership' from a legal standpoint or merely rental) but one thing is for sure: ebook terms will be more restrictive than the paper equivalents, so the current price parity seems counterintuitive. In the UK we also have the nonsense of VAT applying to ebooks but not to paper books. This is apparently because an 'ebook' is not considered to be a type of book. That's an assertion which clearly needs challenging in court (and I know just the barrister to do it, if anyone wants to put up the cash.) 

Moreover, our ebook standards are riddled with holes: epub 2.0.1 is full of inconsistencies and failings, some of which threaten to make successful titles unusable and the Kindle format has similar problems too. For instance, some of the earliest adopters of technology such as ebook readers are programmers, and these people will naturally want to buy programming manuals in electronic form. Unfortunately I've owned several tech books where snippets of example code make no sense because part of the comment from the previous line wraps around and appears on its own line, making you think it's a separate command. This only goes away when the text size is set to its tiniest size which is much smaller than the default most people will see. When you're learning a new language you absolutely need to know what's a command and what's a comment. This is never a problem with paper editions (people would demand a refund) but it's cropped up several times in just my tiny technical library. We're talking about full-price books by reputable publishers which risk not being fit for purpose.

And our DTP software - InDesign being a prime example - handles the creation of ebooks as though it's some obscure feature that the programmers don't really expect anyone to use - and consequently it doesn't matter if it fails often and requires ingenuity and doggedness to use. Ebook creation is non-existent or broken in earlier versions of InDesign and barely usable in the latest CS 5.5 version. And when you preview your ebooks in the software Adobe provides you get minimal feedback about potential problems and can easily sign off on a file which will fail to display perfectly in other e-reader software.

And finally, electronic e-readers still aren't as good as they could be. The super-popular current generation Kindle has a horrible experimental browser built into it which you sometimes need to use to connect to public wifi. I've failed to make a connection on many occasions. And no backlight? I regularly end up using my iPad to read ebooks rather than turn on a light so I can use my Kindle. And of course it needs a way for you to actually buy ebooks that doesn't seem like an afterthought - or doesn't assume you have a laptop handy, thus undermining part of the point of a Kindle. But maybe that will change soon, because...

The new Kindle reader is due out any minute and if it's any good Amazon will presumably sell millions over the Christmas period. I do hope when the lucky recipients of a Christmas Kindle download their first ebook the title they want has actually been made available and they don't discover a weirdly priced, weirdly formatted disappointment. We set our standards so high when it comes to printing on paper; I do hope we'll get our act together on the digital side of the industry before we sell too many more millions of ebooks and take much more of our customers' money.","","","","","2011-09-27","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Just as a little aside and a footnote to the rant below: the thing that got me started complaining about the current state of ebooks was something I didn't even mention. I followed a link to an ebook that was being sold through <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/22870429/When-Curling-Was-King"">Scribd</a>. There I was able to preview enough of the book to decide I liked it. I clicked on the prominent (=intrusive) 'Buy this for $3.00' banner and found... that it was not for sale outside the U.S. ""<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">Selling documents on Scribd is currently only available to users within the United States.</span>"" Scribd, you knew I was outside the U.S. when you previewed it to me and then gave me a 'Buy' button to click on; why do that if you don't plan to accept my money? This is made more annoying because I buy all my Kindle books from the U.S. store not the UK* one. So the Britishness of my location is only sometimes a problem. (Just for balance, does anyone have a story of being on holiday and browsing a bookshop but being turned away at the till for being foreign? No, I thought not.)

No, the title of this post is not the name of a cool short story I have written. It refers to the new version of Amazon's ebook reader, the Kindle Fire, which is announced today. I just want to rush in with a prediction: it won't be all that great. 

The Fire is to be a colour tablet, which makes it a relative of Apple's iPad. Well, the world and his Far Eastern suppliers have been trying to come up with an 'iPad Killer' for a while now; they have not succeeded (HP's recent effort resulted in single-digit percentage sell-through and the closing of that  division of HP). The problem these would-be Apple-slayers all have is that when they get something to be about half as good as the iPad, they down tools and rush it out the door in order to make some delicious money. And then everyone pounces on it and points out its failings and goes back to buying iPads. And if any company was going to stifle their urge to rush something to market and instead stay shackled to the design process for months and months of obsessive, perfectionist fine-tuning and prototyping, it's NOT going to be Amazon. They'll have decided (just like every company except Apple does) that it's Good Enough as it is. But it won't be, because we're a very negative species when it comes to shiny gadgets and before we can notice how wonderful something is, we have to stop getting poked in the eye by all its problems, bugs, niggles and questionable design choices. A company which could release something which looked like the original Kindle is not a design-led business. And I don't believe any business that isn't design-led is going to do a good job making desirable tablets when we have an iPad available for comparison.

(Incidentally, Amazon have given themselves a huge leg up by licensing Google's Android OS instead of hammering together some monstrosity themselves. But Android will need quite a bit of tweaking to run an e-reading tablet, given that it was designed for smartphones. So we're back to the question of whether Amazon will have been obsessive and patient perfectionists when modifying Android or whether they'll have kept one eye on the clock and the other on their quarterly earnings and rushed it out the door. My guess is door-rushing.)

<em>Addendum</em>: I also meant to say that, given Amazon's reliance on selling below cost in the book market - and given that the Fire costs half what the iPad costs (<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/sep/28/kindle-fire-amazon-ignites-tablet-market?newsfeed=true"">link</a>) - my guess is that they are selling it for cost or a little below. So whereas Apple make teetering mountains of cash from their tablet, I personally suspect Amazon's will cost them money - money that they will expect to make back from book purchases and media streaming.","","","","","2011-09-28","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

So, I'm still a little unclear on what Google Books actually is. It appears to be a couple of things: one, a repository of scanned, out-of-copyright books, all ready for you to read; the other, a catalogue of in-copyright books, with a certain amount of metadata, scanned samples of the contents (in some cases) and links to where you can buy each book. When we searched for Snowbooks' catalogue it was an interesting assortment which came up. Lots of duplicates and lots of our titles missing. One of our books included a promotional sticker on the cover image, so these are presumably scans rather than artwork gleaned from, say, Nielsen. To be honest, I haven't spent long enough staring at it all and reading the help files to work out actually what I'm looking at, but it still might be interesting for all you writers and publishers out there to see how much of your oeuvre Google Books has noticed. To see for yourself, go to their homepage (here's the <a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books"">link</a>) and if you're a publisher, type in ""inpublisher:snowbooks"" (only, you know, put your company name in place of 'snowbooks'). If you're an author, type ""inauthor:Robert Finn"" (only, you know, put your name in instead of 'Robert Finn'). In both cases please note that there's no space after the colon. Then depress the enter key and Bob's your auntie's estranged ex. Just don't ask me what to do about it if you don't like what you see 'cos I haven't got that far yet. (Metadata fans also note the downloads of BiBTeX, EndNote and RefMan files for each title.) I'm not quite sure what all this has to do with modern publishers, but I did enjoy looking up and reading excerpts from several books published in the nineteenth century about tunnels under the Thames. It's an excellent resource... whatever it is.","","","","","2011-09-30","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Now, I can't say as I really understand <em>why</em>, but the chaps and chapettes of the Oxford Internet Institute have plotted instances of people performing zombie-related internet searches on a map of the world.

So, there's an ex-Amazon employee who now works for Google, called Steve Yegge, who wrote a firing-up-the-troops <a href=""https://plus.google.com/112678702228711889851/posts/eVeouesvaVX"">internal memo</a> for Google and accidentally published it to the world. If you're tech-savvy, I recommend reading the whole thing because it's about the future of the web - though Yegge isn't really thinking beyond the future of Google. It's all about interfaces that connect all this amazing stuff on the internet to all the other amazing stuff, so that there truly will be an App For Everything in our future. But even if you don't care or understand about platforms vs products, you might like to read the first handful of paragraphs which, well, 'really slag off' is probably the right term, Amazon and Jeff Bezos to an impressive extent.

I think the e-book debate is over. All those who said that paper books smelled better and were safer to read in the bath turned out to have underestimated the appeal of the new technology. Of course paper books will never die (nor would I want them too) and they won't even seriously wane in lots of areas until e-book technology greatly improves. But in the meantime e-books are taking whopping great slices of the text-only publishing pie (and that's at a time when they're still doing lots wrong and everything else badly. See my previous <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/09/ebooks_rant.html"">post</a>.)

The ease with which it's now possible to buy a book is incredible. In fact I think I would characterise my most recent purchases as 'blithe'. You see an Amazon link to a book. Click once to go to Amazon. Click twice to select the Kindle version. Click thrice to 'Buy now with 1-Click'. Now open your Kindle (either the app or the device) and wait for the book to load. It's rare for that whole process to take more than a minute - and despite what the reactionaries say, not only can you read e-books in the bath, it's pretty easy to buy them when you're there too. I speak from experience.

There's just one thing wrong in all of this: it's all Amazon. I thought the Kindle app was horrible until I tried the Kobo offering. It's perversely bad (I kept activating confusing features by accident and when I clicked on a footnote I lost my place in the book). Though it wouldn't make any difference if it were brilliant. Everyone has an Amazon account and when you think e-books, you probably think 'Kindle'. I saw on a friend's Twitter feed that WHSmiths are just about to <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/oct/13/wh-smith-ebook-reader?newsfeed=true"">start selling</a> Kobo readers. Does anyone think this amounts to hitching your wagon to a star? I mean if WHSmiths are partnering with Kobo I take that as a bad omen for Kobo. (My personal belief is that WHSmiths are so badly run they're sometimes a danger to their suppliers.)","'Positive feedback' is that phenomenon where the more you have the more you can get and it applies to Amazon in the book arena. It's about things like economies of scale, critical mass, being the six-hundred pound gorilla at the table. Put it like this: as a reader, why <em>wouldn't</em> you buy your e-books from Amazon? It's the obvious - and I would say the best - choice. But pretty soon Amazon will completely dominate the e-book market - and the e-book market will dominate much of publishing (Amazon can also look forward to a rising share of the paper book market each time a conventional book chain goes bust). And that won't be good because Amazon have a history of playing rough and fighting dirty. If they achieve effective monopoly, they'll want to take the lion's share of the profits available to the book supply chain. Prepare to be squeezed. 

I don't know what can be done about it because we've left it extremely late to start fighting back. Maybe Apple could do it if they got serious about their not-very-impressive iBooks platform (though, interestingly, <a href=""http://www.apple.com/ios/features.html#newsstand"">Newsstand</a> may well make them a force to be reckoned with in periodicals). Maybe Google could do it if they had a compelling reason to (book vending is not really where anyone's dreams of avarice lead them). But I don't know what the rest of us can achieve. Sorry to be gloomy about this, but I don't currently see a solution. Publishers refusing to sell to Amazon, or collectively negotiating terms, would only make a dent if most of us did it (and that sort of feels like fighting anti-competitive ends with anti-competitive means), plus we'd really need to get started on that in about 2006. Anyone got any differing views on whether that's where we're headed or what we might be able to do about it?","","","","2011-10-14","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

Back in the dot.com boom era there was much talk of 'disintermediation'. In case you don't know the word, you could think of it as meaning cutting-out-the-middleman-ation. In the late Nineties, the internet improved everyone's visibility of... everything, really. And sometimes you no longer needed a middleman to introduce you to someone you could do business with. Or, more importantly, perhaps you no longer wanted to pay for the privilege of what amounted to a Google search. This is the 'middleman as dating agency' role: matching buyers and sellers, clients to service-providers. In most cases, the middleman does more than just bring the two parties together. But <em>how much</em> more they do makes all the difference to whether they get disintermediated once buyers and sellers can find each other in other (usually internet-related) ways.

There's been a lot of talk recently of publishers being disintermediated by authors who self-publish, going direct to the retailers themselves. I don't think Amazon are the first to do the same thing from the other end, but given how they seem poised to take over the world - at least the book world (see previous <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/10/amazon_hegemony.html#more"">post</a>) - it's probably worth watching when they decide that part of the book supply-chain needs reconfiguring.

Alan: <span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">Interesting post, Rob. From what I've read over the last year or so, no one really knows what to do about it - least of all the big publishers.

Even big-name writers are doing it.</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">Nevertheless, publishers remain (and should remain) the gatekeepers in terms of ensuring a certain standard of quality; and even those writers (how many? Two?) who have hit the big time after self-publishing success on Kindle have been offered traditional publishing deals on the strength of it.</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">I think that Amazon will achieve an effective monopoly, but the question is, how long will that last before others (whether Google or Apple or whoever) decide to really get their act together and mount a serious challenge? Things look grim at the moment because this technology is still in its infancy; but further down the line, Amazon is bound to be challenged by other big players.</span>","Rob: <span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;"">Hi Alan, the 'gatekeeper' thing is an interesting one. I mean, if there's a market for a particular author, would it really be right for us to try to stand in the way? So are we only 'gatekeepers' in the sense that we try to predict what will sell so that we don't waste money on the uncommercial stuff? And does that mean that if there was a cheaper way to release books (which, increasingly there is) we can just lob it all out there and let the market decide? Like Clay Shirky says in his very interesting book <strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Here-Comes-Everybody-Happens-Together/dp/0141030623/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1318747045&sr=8-1"">Here Comes Everybody</a></strong>, in some ways the internet allows you to do your filtering *after* you publish an article or what-have-you (based on feedback) not before (based on predictions).</span>

Alan: <span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">Hi Rob. Regarding publishers as gatekeepers, I think the criterion is quality rather than commercialism. In principle, it might be OK to publish Kindle editions of anything one thinks could be popular (since the overheads are so small), but I'm pretty sure it would damage a publisher's credibility if the quality of the writing wasn't there. I've done the rounds of a few writers' networking sites, and there are some real stinkers out there (and a few absolute gems also, it must be said).</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">I read somewhere that, since publishers are less inclined to put time and effort into editing these days, even big name authors' books now contain typos and infelicities of style which, a few years ago, would have been caught and corrected prior to publication.</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">I think your question on whether it's right for publishers to ""stand in the way"" of an author trying to reach a particular market is a very important one. If the material is good and well-written, the answer, I guess, is no; but if it's a good story badly written (or a bad story badly written), then the publisher's reputation is at stake in putting it out there (even just to Kindle). The question then becomes: do you spend precious time working with the author to knock their material into shape (which may or may not be possible), or do you concentrate on good material that requires minimal editing?</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">Your point about filtering after publication, based on feedback, is also important. To me, it implies a scatter-gun approach - i.e. fire off a big bunch of stuff and see what sticks. But is that really what publishers should be doing, when the online community of unpublished writers are already doing it?</span>

Rob:  <span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;"">Alan, I agree with you that putting out low-quality books would damage a publisher's reputation, but what I'm thinking about here is how to justify the existence of publishers in the first place. Once a publisher is established, they presumably need to do good work to attract good authors and good retailers, but why does the world as a whole need publishers at all when authors can self-publish? How does a publisher make money when their services are optional. Publishers, as you point out, usually set themselves up as arbiters of good taste, but unless readers notice AND PAY MORE for that publisher's books then where is the commercial basis for that process? Publishers could end up like restaurant critics who can't find a newspaper to pay them for their reviews. If a reader can buy a self-published book that looks interesting to them, how will publishers manage to interpose themselves and say ""for an extra 1 I'll tell you why you shouldn't buy this book and why you should buy one of ours instead""? And how do we make sure that readers believe us, because I've bought my share of what seem like crappy books but which bear the name of big publishing houses on their spines.</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;"">And then we have the vexed question of what is quality. Look at all the million-selling authors who couldn't get signed by the first twenty publishers they approached, who now give joy to millions. If publishers are justifying their existence by being arbiters of quality, why can't they agree on anything? When I buy a book, should I have to factor in paying the salaries of the people who couldn't spot that J K Rowling's books would be popular? Why would I want to pay for arbiters of quality who don't reflect my personal tastes? What if they're determined to steer me towards John Banville when what I really want is some Dan Brown? Should I pay publishers for that service?</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;"">The only consensus I can spot among publishers is that text should be grammatical, spelled correctly and sensibly laid out - and increasingly a computer can do that. Moreover, as you point out, it seems that publishers are starting to scrimp even on those basics - particularly in the growing e-book market. I don't think publishers are doing a very good job of justifying their existence. </span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;"">If publishers are going to make their money from the guarantee of quality they offer then 1) readers have to notice that guarantee and 2) readers have to pay more for it than the books of lax publishers and self-published books (even good ones). I can't see that happening yet and I can't quite see how it's going to happen in the future except in specialist areas (like technical publishing) and in imprints (like the Idiot's Guide or Lonely Planet). </span>

Alan: <span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">Lots of food for thought here. I wouldnt describe publishers as arbiters of good taste as such, but they certainly should be arbiters of good spelling, grammar and syntax. In the past, I have engaged the services of a professional manuscript reader, who did a fabulous job of pointing out lapses in plot and other problems. That doesnt mean I wrote badly, it just means that there were a few wrinkles which I couldnt see, so close was I to the material. I wonder how many self-published authors have made that investment of three or four hundred pounds to get a professional with a good eye to knock their MS into shape. This is the essential service which a good editor provides to a writer (God bless you, Ms Torborg!), and this is the reason why a properly edited book published by a traditional publisher is likely to be a better read, as it were, than a self-published book with no professional editorial input. Id suggest thats worth an extra pound of anyones money.

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">And dont forget that while a computer can help with grammar and spelling, it cant spot correctly-spelled words that have been misused, and it will often flag as ungrammatical a sentence that has been purposefully composed in an unusual way. A computer knows the rules, but it cant spot when a human who also knows the rules is using his/her knowledge and experience to break those rules in an interesting way.</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">A serious potential threat to traditional publishers, I think, is if their own authors decide to sidestep them and self-publish (which a few are doing). I read about one big-name author (cant remember who, Im afraid) who walked away from a half-million dollar advance to self-publish his latest book, because he thinks hell make more money that way  and at Amazons 75% royalty rate, hes probably right. And of course, if the next J K Rowling decides not to approach any publishers in the first place and self-publish instead, then the publishers are going to miss a very big trick.</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">And yet ... lets think about that. Lets say that someone self-publishes a YA fantasy novel that becomes MASSIVELY popular on Kindle. Im willing to bet that a major publisher would contact her and offer her a high seven-figure advance for her next novel; and Im also willing to bet that she would think: Hmm ... carry on self-publishing or take the eight million theyre offering and see my books as ACTUAL books? Theyll be putting out Kindle editions anyway. Sure, I wont be making 75% royalty, but what the hell? Ill become a multi-millionaire just by saying yes!</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">The other threat, of course, is simply the overshadowing of physical book sales by ebook sales. Now, you know a hell of a lot more about publishing than I do, but surely it would be fairly straightforward for publishers to adapt their business models to this new scenario, and put out more ebooks at lower prices? Wouldnt the lowering of revenues be offset by the vast decrease in the overheads associated with physical books, i.e. production costs, warehouse storage, shipping costs to bricks-and-mortar bookshops etc.? Or am I being simplistic?</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">I just cant get past my feeling that publishers are important, and probably always will be. Otherwise, I cant help thinking that the whole thing will turn into an analogue of the punk rock ethos in the mid-seventies. It was great in principal, sure: anyone could pick up a guitar and form a band, and there were some fabulous punk bands. But most of it was garbage, most of them couldnt play for toffee, and it didnt last long. Anyone being able to write and publish books sounds great  hell, it IS great, and more power to anyone who does it; but I think the time will come when readers will think: I know I only paid 1.99 for this, but it would have been so much better if it had been properly edited.</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkred;"">PS: Ive just read Ewan Morrisons Guardian article (which I guess I should have done at the outset), and he makes a very interesting point on long-tail e-publishing, which raises a question for me. If professional writing really is in danger of becoming extinct, if writers really will be forced to produce their material for little or no money in the future, how many people will actually DO IT? How many people will write and publish the one novel thats in them, and then never be heard from again? My guess is a lot. And then there will be the people who have a lot of books in them, whose passion for their craft will spur them on to keep producing books (much as they have always done); and those are the writers who will become loved and sought after by their audience, who (one would fervently hope) will always be willing to put their hands in their pockets to buy a ticket into the worlds they create. Romantic nonsense? Maybe, but its what I choose to believe.</span>


Rob:  <span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;"">You know, I don't think we're very far apart on what we think is a good idea and what we think is bad. I think where we differ is the extent to which we think the world of books will be influenced by what is good. I don't disagree that it's preferable in many (most?) ways for a book to have received the services of a publisher - even if those services are procured independently without involving an actual real-life publisher. But I look at the industry of authors, publishers and readers a little like biologists look at systems of predator and prey (not because I'm being macho, just because I find the ideas useful). In a world where most publishers publish superior e-books compared with a lower-grade morass of self-published work, what will happen to the first publisher to cut corners and adopt that scatter-gun approach we discussed of dumping lots of poorly curated titles onto the market? Well, presumably they will disappoint many of their readers who expected better. And perhaps they will profit handsomely too, because they were able to charge the same rate as more conscientious peers, but spend less than them. So how will the system punish them to make sure their approach doesn't become the norm? I'm not sure it will. Or rather, I think the system would have to change considerably in order that slapdash e-book publishers didn't (temporarily) thrive once they'd found a way to enjoy higher margins than their more sober cousins. In a sense, I think this has been going on with paper publishing for a while - standards have slipped and all that's happened is that we regard the act of buying a book by an unfamiliar author as even more of a lucky dip than ever. </span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;"">I mean, consider what happens when a traditional reader buys a paperback and discovers it's a turkey. They probably avoid that author in the future, but do they rotate that book through a quarter turn in order to discover the publisher's mark on the spine and avoid it in the future? Do they penalise that publishing house for allowing a substandard author through their gates? And what if the book contains accidental homonyms and an eye-gougingly cackhanded style? Granted, the crimes of sloppy publishing are far more heinous in the self-published e-book morass, but I don't see any sign that readers differentiate between different publishers when selecting a book in anything like the way they differentiate between authors (with the possible exception of Penguin, perhaps).</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;"">I think the waters are muddied here by the scrappy quality of current e-books. As I've noted <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/09/ebooks_rant.html"">elsewhere</a>, I bought a New York Times bestseller in e-book format that contained a row of six square boxes at the end of a paragraph. It was supposed to be an ellipsis, but it didn't display properly in the Kindle app on the iPad. So how do I punish Vintage for that lapse? A lapse that would be something of a scandal in a paperback. The problem is that I already find the quality of typesetting and font choice, etc, amateurish in the extreme on the Kindle platform (and partly that's because of failings of the platform itself), and, as you mentioned, I'm noticing a dozen or more typos in even the most high-profile paper books, and yet I haven't yet made a mental note to avoid a particularly publishing house.</span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;"">If good quality editing and typesetting, etc, is to hold its own against the higher margins of scatter-gun e-publishing, the virtues of the good publishers will need to become explicit to the reader rather than implicit as they are now. And readers will have to pay for them. There will, I suppose, need to be something approaching a kite mark, where publishers guarantee the fidelity of their proofing and formatting process - and back that guarantee with some sort of refund offer. And readers will need to consciously choose to part with more pennies for those quality-stamped publications. </span>

<span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;"">But even that extends no further than the medium term. The new iPhone 4S apparently does a remarkable job of acting upon spoken instructions. Take a look <a href=""http://www.tuaw.com/2011/10/05/iphone-4s-what-can-you-say-to-siri/"">here</a> at the sorts of commands it can handle. I don't doubt the day is soon coming when a word-processor has not just spell-check and grammer-check, but the grammar-check works and catches all the which/that who/whom less/fewer gotchas and much more besides. I can remember how annoyed I was when Word 2007 suggested a reconfiguration of a sentence and I realised it actually had a good point. As publishers, we'll need to pin our hopes on more than proof-reading and tidy layouts because one day soon such things will be automatically generated. And whatever that remaining ineffable quality is that we offer, it will need to be something that readers can see and are willing to pay for, otherwise lax publishers will say they have it when they don't and self-publisher authors will do without it entirely.</span>","","","","2011-10-18","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

To continue the unrelenting book-related gloomfest: I'm not sure how I missed <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/aug/22/are-books-dead-ewan-morrison"">this polemic</a> by Ewan Morrison, in the Guardian, as part of their Edinburgh International Book Festival coverage.

He lays out his stall pretty well, though I would counsel you not to set too much store by estimates of piracy from within an industry. (To my mind, the MPAA and RIAA are both guilty of a frenzy of double-counting. If I download an album illegally, listen to one song, and hate it, they'll decide I stole the full retail price of the album from them - even if I were never going to buy it. If I like what I hear and go and buy the CD to play in the car, they'll still count my download as theft.)

I don't agree with any of his suggestions at the end. I mean, who decides who 'professional writers' are and thus who gets paid? And he also makes little of the fact that an author might get as much income from selling twenty thousand self-published e-books at 1 each as from selling two hundred thousand paperbacks via a publisher at 8 each. Surely the former scenario is much more achievable than the latter.  But ultimately I agree that the golden age of writers, musicians and maybe even movie-makers is over. It seems very likely that those industries will contract, fewer people will create art as a way of making a living - but, for what it's worth, there'll be more and better books, music and movies available than ever (because some people will still make a living at it and many will do it for reasons other than the money). I think the key thing to realise, though, is that (as <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/05/wise_old_rocker.html"">Mick Jagger pointed out</a>) no one said that your industry, be it music, movies or books, owes you a living.","","","","","2011-10-18","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Dear Amazon, in your Kindle app you have given me the ability to highlight text and share it with my friends on Facebook or Twitter. I have yet to come across a piece of text in an e-book that I want to share with my pals. However, I would please like to be able to share all the typos and mistakes that I'm highlighting with the publisher of the e-book. If you added this as an option, you would be improving the quality of the e-book market as a whole and helping save money for your publishers (who are going to need that money soon). I already have several books marked up ready for you to add this feature. Anyone who edits for a living will probably provide this service for you for free because when we see a mistake we itch to correct it. So you'd even be helping your readers by offering this function.

Thanks,

Rob

<span style=""font-family: courier;"">Update</span>: There seems to be a bit of a trend in the comments that proofreading is beyond the lay reader. It is best left to professionals and should always occur <em>before</em> publication. OK, then. Shall I revise my suggestion that Amazon let me share highlighted typos with the publishers; instead, what about the idea that I enlist the services of master ninja hackers so that when I highlight a typo, it also gets highlighted on every other Kindle screen? The ignorant are thus educated about bad spelling and grammar, and sloppy publishers are shamed into seeking out the finest paid proofreaders forever more.

There's a vague but misleading Islamic reference in the title of this post. Please ignore that. 'KF8' is nothing to do with the establishment of a pan-Islamic state; it's the new e-book format Amazon are planning to adopt as a replacement for 'Mobi 7'. There's a marketing-y overview <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_357883242_1?ie=UTF8&docId=1000729511&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=right-4&pf_rd_r=0CMAC1B4YFZ6Z9ZER51R&pf_rd_t=1401&pf_rd_p=1325986302&pf_rd_i=1000729901"">here</a>. KF8 is based on some subset of HTML5/CSS3. Which is, as I hope you know, what the web uses too - at least the most modern bits of it. And it's similar to how EPUB works too. You kind of turn your book into a little website with lots of webpages (=chapters) and stylesheets and then you zip the whole thing up and call it an e-book.

One thing I find interesting about this is that, if you think about it, e-books - both EPUB and now Kindle - have a lot more in common with your website than with your InDesign or QuarkXPress files. I mean, no wonder it's so difficult getting an EPUB book out of InDesign. InDesign uses carefully positioned frames for everything and only within those frames does it allow anything to reflow or move around a little - a very little. The first thing you do when using a DTP package like InDesign is to say exactly what size bits of paper you're about to typeset for. But the two main e-book formats are much more loosey-goosey, exactly like a webpage. When you don't know whether an e-book is going to be read on something tall and thin and tiny, with only six fonts (like a smartphone screen) or wide and huge (like a computer monitor) you need everything in the e-book to be good at moving itself around or reflowing onto the next page - and you'd like all that reconfiguring to work in a sensible way to retain readability and acceptable aesthetics.","DTP software like InDesign isn't really designed to help with that. If we want our printed text to look good on two different sizes of paper then we typeset it twice and create two different output files. Given the era we live in, it would actually make more sense if a DTP application helped you to embed all sorts of sensible rules about reflowing and reconfiguring into your e-books - and then it let you lock down the paper size and create a print-ready output file if you wanted to. Going in the opposite direction - i.e. adding in intelligence to fixed-papersize files - is an uphill struggle. If I were Quark, I'd be rewriting QuarkXPress from the ground up along those lines because it would give me a chance to snatch back the DTP crown from InDesign. And if I were Adobe, I'd probably be too busy hitting myself in the face because of how bad InDesign's e-book export functionality is to get any new software written. 

So bad is InDesign's workflow when it comes to typesetting a paper book and then trying to export an EPUB based on that layout that I've started to wonder if one might be better off starting with (gasp!) a Word file or using a piece of software more geared for creating webpages than typesetting books as the starting point. At any rate, until the tools improve, e-books will continue to look amateurish on a regular basis and the DTP software market will contain to have a big hole in it which could swallow up either of the main players.","","","","2011-10-21","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"
"42524","","1","Theories of storytelling","Publish","true","<div class=""pic""><img alt=""screenplay.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/screenplay.jpg"" width=""206"" height=""213"" /></div>

All this talk about the trade side of publishing - maybe it's time to think about the authors and readers out there. I'm going to ramble on for quite a long while exploring some of the 'rules' of storytelling. Assuming that there are rules - which is something else I want to think about. 

About ten years ago, when I was first interested in how to construct a story for a novel, I read a few books on the subject and none of the advice they contained seemed like it was addressing what I was stuck on. Then I switched to books on screenwriting and found a deluge of advice: rules and guidelines and sure-fire processes you had to follow. Many of the advice-givers acted like the planning of movies was closer to engineering than art. According to the handbook writers, movies have acts even if the viewer isn't aware of them. In order to make the story compelling and satisfying, the plot would want to pivot through a major change of direction where act one meets act two and then again where act two gives way to act three.

I can imagine some of you may be wriggling in your seats at the thought that any of this could apply to novel-writing. Writing a novel, like raising a child, is something you're supposed to be allowed to do in whatever weird way you want to. And of course that's true. But I'm someone who likes to read thrillers and a thriller is a novel with a specific job to do, so it's not unreasonable to think that it might have to tick certain boxes and conform to  certain expectations. That's the thing about genre: write something that defies too many of the conventions and you may find you haven't written a genre novel at all. So if some novels do have rules - or at least expectations that need to be met - it might be helpful to drag them into the light.","So let's just say that I'm open to the idea that a novel can learn something from a movie and I'm interested by the idea that a paperback thriller might be constructed using some of the same high-performance parts Hollywood bolts together for its own thrill rides.

Screenwriting terminology has it that movies break down into acts and acts break down into scenes. And I think much of the time a scene (or sequence of connected scenes) would map to a chapter in book-speak. So how do you write a scene? Well, much emphasis seems to be placed upon conflict. Drama - which is a nebulous substance held to be the lifeblood of a scene - seems to come from tension and jeopardy and conflict. Imperil a character or have her clash with others. Scenes where everyone sits around agreeing are dull - and presumably they are only there for the purposes of 'exposition'. 

'Exposition' is another cornerstone of screenwriting and is talked of in the same terms pet owners talk of administering worming pills. If possible mash it up into their food so that they don't know they're eating it but you need to get it into them somehow. You can't avoid exposition entirely because 'exposition' is about giving the viewer/reader the information they need in order to understand the story. When the audience don't know what's going on, you may have skimped on the exposition. When they start yawning at each line of dialogue, you may have overdone the exposition. But clearly the viewer needs enough background to understand something of why the characters are doing the things they're doing and enough context to understand what the stakes are. There's even talk of what you might call 'forward exposition' - and which the books call 'foreshadowing' - which give the viewer veiled hints of where the story might be going. My impression is that when screenwriters talk of 'foreshadowing' they're talking about something akin to the way novelists talk about symbolism and themes: that's to say it's about the hidden resonances of the narrative. But I'm actually more interested in something a bit more overt and practical than foreshadowing. I think about 'forward exposition' a lot because I often feel viewers need to understand what kind of story they're in and roughly what shape it will have if they're to really get absorbed in it. Subverting the conventions is great and all, but a lot of the time knowing that you're watching a whodunnit is a big help when it comes to paying attention to what's important and tuning out things the writer didn't intend you to notice. We'll come back to that question of how you might prime viewers on the overall shape of the story they're in. First, let's think about writing a scene.

We've been told we need dramatic conflict, and if we think about where we might get some from the answer leads to the third big ingredient of movie storytelling: characterisation. If the characters are distinct and well-established then if you put any two of them together they're bound to disagree on something. They need not bicker, but they can subtly clash over approach or values or viewpoints. Of course many screenwriters seem to think that if a little conflict is good then more is better. They're the guys who write dramas where everyone is constantly furious with everyone else. Because drama = conflict = shouting. I think of this as the 'Eastenders' school of writing (for all I know, Eastenders has a gossamer subtlety that makes Austen seem like Brainiacs, but whenever I catch a snippet of it, it's always people shouting at each other.)

Presumably now that we've got characterisation, from which we can get some conflict, and we've snuck in some exposition, we've got a scene. But we need to link those scenes together to tell a story, which takes us back to acts - and that brings up the question of arcs. Act one will bring us the 'precipitating event': the letter from an old friend, the phone call at 2am, the flirtatious meeting with a stranger. That event drags the protagonist into the story we're about to tell. Act two will see them walk this new path until they reach a crisis at the end of act two. The end of act two is signaled in a number of ways. Descriptions like 'darkest before the dawn' or the 'dark night of the soul' often crop up. That pivotal point may follow from a moment of apparent defeat. One screenwriting system talks about the 'whiff of death'. At the end of act two someone or something usually dies: the hero's mentor or guardian, usually, though the death can be more metaphorical. It's a signal that things cannot go on as they are. They require a change and that change is what propels us into act three and the resolution of the story.

That change should not simply be a shift in tactics; it should also be an emotional shift. The handbook-writers are very clear on the fact that good stories change the characters within them. They're different people at the end of the movie than at its start. Certainly the hero must change and often those around him are transformed too. And smart screenwriters do their best to link the internal voyage of the character to the external one. In fact it's a well-established movie trope that until the character changes inside their head they can't overcome whatever problem is bedeviling them externally. If you want a corny example, think of the (ridiculous) father-complex that Tom Cruise's character has in Top Gun. Until the hero can get over some mental hurdle or accept some emotional truth they can't kick the bad guy's ass. In a superhero story that internal change is often accepting that they really are a superhero (similarly for 'the chosen one' in fantasy stories). Though we've seen that so many times that watching 90 mins of someone refusing to accept they can fight crime or control dragons is getting pretty boring. 

It is often this linking of internal and external changes - and making the external hinge on the internal - that gives thrillers emotional resonance. It's often more powerful still if, along with a change in character, the main protagonist <em>recognises</em> that they've changed. In other words, they've acquired some self-knowledge. Frequently that can feel like the most important aspect of the story: all is in ruins, small fires still burn in the background, the hero sits with his head in his hands aware that he's starting from scratch, having lost everything, but at least now he knows who he is and that changes everything.

To flog my dead horse of choice, what I dislike most about typical episodes of the BBC sci-fiasco, Torchwood, is that it takes seriously the requirement to lard every scene with conflict and jeopardy (or 'constant vicious bickering' which is their version of conflict) and it does its best at characterisation, but there's rarely any emotional journey for the characters. Or rather those journeys are not treated seriously: a character reaches a breaking point and then... forgets about it in time for next week when they go off the rails again. They're just puppets because they have no convincing emotional life and they don't change or come to understand themselves.

So there we go. That's the bare bones of what screenwriters say about telling a story. Now you may choose to disagree with any of those ideas or you may feel that a good story can be told without recourse to any of them, and that's your prerogative. But I'm quite conservative in my tastes, preferring traditionally structured thrillers - or rom-coms or heist movies or what-have-you - in other words genres that require some adherence to the accepted forms <em>within which</em> there's plenty of scope for freshness and invention. So I'm much more interested in the question: is it possible to follow all those suggestions of structure and content and still produce a dud. Well, of course the answer is 'yes' and the quickest route there is simply sloppiness or a lack of originality. But assuming someone with good ideas has worked hard to produce a story which hasn't broken any of the 'rules' mentioned here, why might it still fall flat. And that's the question I want to consider in the next post when I talk about the BBC Three supernatural drama, The Fades.","","","","2011-10-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

My <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/10/theories_of_storytelling_1.html#more"">last post</a> was a hasty recap of what screenwriters have to say about storytelling (albeit my interpretation based on my limited knowledge). I wanted to consider a particular example of storytelling in this post by looking at the very interesting and also slightly flawed drama The Fades, which has been showing on BBC Three for the last five weeks. There's one more episode to come, at the time I'm writing this, and I don't think there's any way for me to talk about the show without spoiler-ing it, so be aware there are heavy spoilers for eps 1-5 ahead.","There's a lot to like about The Fades. It looks great and it sounds great. There are no weak links in the acting. There's very little clich&eacute; in the dialogue: people are forever saying things you haven't heard before. It's funny (occasionally it's also annoying, but only a little). And it's so weird and inventive that it's difficult to think of anything that's quite like it - at least in tone if not in structure.

But. Did you sense a 'but' coming? Even though I like almost everything about it, I find my attention wandering or I find myself getting impatient with the pace of the story. And I think part of that is another tip that screenwriting manuals typically mention - usually in their troubleshooting section - that you have to make sure your protagonists aren't too passive or too reactive? And I think The Fades really suffers here. 

For eps 1-4, Paul, the main character, is unsure about everything. He's confused and passive and events happen to him as though he's merely a cork bobbing around in a storm. Moreover he suffers from the typical superhero/'chosen one' problem in that he rejects the idea that he's special - or if he is, he's not sure what to do about it. His approach to everything appears to be to pretend it's not happening.

Mark the schoolteacher is also a confused victim of events. And DCI Armstrong, Mac's dad, is the same: powerless and confused. And when he does act, it's to make matters worse because he's totally in the dark too. Paul's mum also fails to understand what's happening and Jay and Anna are both oblivious as well (one in a kind way, the other as cuttingly as possible). Only the Angelics are a little bit pro-active - but they can't really get any grip on their destinies because they're quickly slaughtered, for the most part, so any 'agency' they may have amounts to nothing. They don't properly understand what's happening nor are they able to affect it. Which means there's no one to tell us what all the dream sequences and murders and pupating are all about until we've watched about three hours of this stuff. Even when Neil hints that he has a few answers, Paul pushes him for very few of them. He's too busy staring off into the distance to share our hunger for the knowledge needed to make sense of events. And if he isn't demanding that information then why should we care about it? Yet without it, much of what happens is opaque to us.

Episode 4 marks a change: characters start to get a grip on their lives and by episode 5 even Paul is beginning to act rather than react. But it's been a long time in coming and only at the very end of ep 5 does Paul seem to have made a meaningful decision about his future (I don't count his earlier decision to live a double life because in practice that just meant totally ignoring everything except Jay). And there's been so little useful exposition that I keep discovering new facts in the 'Previously' montage at the beginning of a new episode. Now that's not on: you shouldn't be learning what the hell happened last time by watching a recap of it.

(In fact renaming ghosts as 'fades' actually muddies the waters. Call them 'ghosts' and we're immediately halfway to understanding the significance when they start taking solid form. Was the writer shying away from the word 'ghosts' to avoid acknowledging that the Angelics could best be described as 'ghostbusters'? <span style=""font-family: courier; color: darkblue;""><em>Update:</em> it sounds like that's a pretty good theory. In <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/writersroom/2011/07/writer_report_tv_drama_-_the_w.shtml"">this interview</a>, the writer, Jack Thorne, says that Ghostbusters - crossed with a U.S. show called Freaks and Geeks - was the starting point for The Fades.</span>)

And I suppose the problem starts with the Angelics. If anyone sort of knows what's going on with the dead being reborn, it's them, even though they are wrongfooted at every turn by events. But after five episodes we still don't know what their function was. They have guns, they have special powers, but what on earth were they up to before dead people started coming back to life? The world used to be full of ghosts that most people couldn't see: why do you need firearms, clairvoyance and the power to heal in order to 'police' those ghosts? What does that even mean? In a sense, the story takes place not in our everyday reality but in the reality of the Angelics - and we've never learned the rules of that world. Stories must abide by their own internal logic if they're to make sense and we still haven't been made privy to that logic.

What I'm saying is that without a bit more exposition up-front, I haven't been able to work out the significance of much of what's happened until a couple of hours of viewing later. And that's a tricky thing to ask of a viewer: that they store large chunks of the plot for later interpretation, or worse, so they can react to it emotionally later. The only things we do understand early on is that we want Jay and Paul to get together, and we want Anna to be nicer, for Paul's mum to understand him better, and we want people to treat Mac well and for Mac to support Paul in being... whatever he is. And those were the moments that made the most sense and felt the most interesting. But there have also been dozens of scenes by now that contained transformations or chases or encounters or sightings for which there was no explanation or context - which means it was difficult to feel very connected to them. And there were characters, like Mark the schoolteacher and Sarah his wife, who didn't appear to be relevant for a long while.

Now of course the writer doesn't want to fix all these problems by inserting a cheesy voiceover at the start of episode 1 which intones, ""Since the dawn of time, the Angelics have watched over The Fades, the souls of the dead who wander the Earth. But now a change has come..."" No, the writer wants to leave all of that a mystery and have the viewer work it all out. Which is well and good, but instead of setting the characters to work, purposefully digging up the exposition they need in order to make sense of what's happening, he's had them stumble around bewildered for the first three hours of the story, leaving me wishing we could skip ahead to the point where they snap out of it and show some 'agency'.

If I'm right, then having a few characters acting purposefully, according to decisions each has made, would have made them seem much more vibrant and interesting - which in turn would have held my attention a little better. They don't need to be on the right track from the start, but they do need to have some direction and be exerting themselves in ways we can identify with. 

Now you might say that it's very artificial to demand that the protagonists of a story are dynamic and decisive. In real life people often dither. But the problem with that argument is that if the hero of your story acts listless and bewildered for long enough, then they cease to be the story's hero and characters in the background with more 'agency' start stealing scenes. Bad superhero movies are often like that: the baddie is dynamic and interesting, the good guy simply wrestles with his doubts and responds to the baddie, which makes him seem like he's on autopilot. My recollection of the early Batman movies are like that: Batman is bland and plodding, but the Joker and the Penguin bring the story to life.

I'm not suggesting we do away with self-doubt or that no one must ever panic. But there's a difference between watching a character struggling to orient themselves versus watching them flounder helplessly for hours. And until the hero's character begins to assert itself and affect the shape of the story, even the most fabulous gore and humour and occult mystery can seem like treading water.

That all said, I'm definitely looking forward to the finale next week. I'm fairly sure they'll have saved some good stuff for last. Moreover, none of the above should be taken to mean that I a) don't want more dramas like The Fades or b) don't want more dramas from the people who made The Fades.

I'm not unsympathetic to those who struggle with computers and software and the web, but my question to you is this: what are you going to do about it? 

There's very little in the world of publishing that doesn't directly involve computers - and all of it indirectly does. There's a bit of decision-making that might be done without a computer present but that's about it. Even the arty stuff - like cover design or layouts or writing the books themselves - is done using software. 'Books' are really data files until they reach the printers. E-books are data from start to finish: a Word file meets a Photoshop cover design, becomes an InDesign file, maybe turns into a PDF or an EPUB and then maybe ends up as a Mobi file. Your statutory and management accounts are data files, manipulated using software. Most of your correspondence is e-mail. Your marketing involves lots of e-mail or web-sites or sending off print-ready data files. And increasingly the world only finds out about your books because ONIX files get sent out to all the organisations who need to know. If you can't perform some of those functions because you don't know your way round the right piece of software, you're holding your company back. And what about looking after all those computers and the files they contain? If your hard drive fails, have you got backups? Can you set up a replacement computer with all the software and files you need to keep working? 

You can pay someone else to do some of these things for you - even most of them. But the time is approaching when you might find yourself paying someone else to do <em>everything</em> for you. And that would be bad, right?","I used to see men in their late fifties on the train in the morning, sitting in the first class compartment, using a fountain pen to write replies to e-mails that their secretaries had printed out for them. Those secretaries would presumably type up the responses too. Perhaps a few of those guys just found the feel of a gold nib gliding across paper preferable to a keyboard - and the cost of a secretary was peanuts to them. But most of those men (it appears that most older bosses are still men) I'm pretty sure couldn't type and couldn't work their e-mail programs. Or even if they could, they didn't care to. My dad was like that: computers were for 'computer people'. Which meant that even sending e-mails was something you delegated to a technical person. He wrote large cheques so the IT people could upgrade their systems but he did his best not to actually <em>use</em> any of those systems. 

I'm sure you're not in that category (few people still are) and you'd agree it's ridiculous to write out e-mail replies in longhand and then pay someone else to type them up. An able-bodied employee who claims they can't work their e-mail program, even after suitable training, would be fired not humoured these days. But how sure are you that you're not just the next iteration of the fountain-pen-e-mail-writer? Do you sometimes find yourself typing the exact same repetitive set of keystrokes over and over again, and then notice someone a bit more tech-savvy staring at you in disbelief?

I've written out a bunch of questions here so you can just get a feel for what you know and don't know. I'd expect a comfortably-tech-savvy person to know the answers to about two-thirds of them. You might have to take my word for it that most of them aren't particularly advanced. (And I suppose if enough people are interested I might write answers to the questions just because it's a bit unfair to ask them otherwise - but I won't do that unless there's a fair bit of interest 'cos it would be a load of work to do well):

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">You need to send some files overseas and they're too big to e-mail. Could you FTP them? Do you know what that means and would you know what software to use and roughly how to go about it?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">And could you say why FTP might not be very secure? Similarly, do you know what HTTP and HTTPS are and what the difference is?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">If you needed to rename a couple of hundred files to add today's date to their filenames would you be able to write a macro or a script or a little program to do it? Or would you just have to do it by hand or ask someone else?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">If you needed to quickly change some text on a webpage, do you think you'd know enough about a typical webserver to find the right file and enough about HTML to add the text without spoiling the page? Could you also dip into the CSS file and make that text green instead of red? What is CSS?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">Could you add a vignette to a Photoshop file? Or even just resize a photo? Would you know the pros and cons of GIFs, JPEGs, TIFFs and PNGs and which might be appropriate to send to a printer?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">Do you know what RGB and CMYK are? Again, which one might you use when you're sending something to a printer?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">If you want to print out an A1 sized poster would you rather start with a small bitmapped image or a small vector graphic? Why?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">Could you swap out a broken hard drive from your computer, reinstall the operating system and restore all your files from a backup? Do you have a backup?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">When setting up e-mail on your new smartphone do you have any idea what POP3, IMAP and SMTP are for? Any idea what bearing SSL might have on the process?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">Could you encrypt an e-mail if you needed to? Do you have any idea why public key encryption might not just keep the contents of an e-mail secure but also help you be sure who it's from?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">When trying to get your new laptop to connect to the internet do you have any idea what an IP address is, or a DNS server, or DHCP or subnet masks?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">Do you know what a firewall actually does and why you might want one? Have you got one?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">What's a NAS? Might you need one? Should it contain a RAID array? What is RAID?</span>

* <span style=""font-family: courier;"">Can you move around a Windows or a Mac or a Unix file system just using a command line? Could you find and rename a file that way?</span>

So how did you do? Bear in mind I'm not asking you <em>create</em> an FTP client or <em>design</em> an image format; I'm only asking whether you can use existing ones, so clearly we're not at the advanced end of the spectrum here.

I think it's safe to say that a lot of this world runs on software, hardware and networking. Getting good at using it is an investment in your future, not just at work but in the rest of your life too. The pace of change is not going to slow down and you're going to feel marginalised, powerless and foolish if you let it all get away from you. So any time you come across one of these techie challenges, make sure you come away knowing the answers. The easy part is that thanks to these very same technologies, the answers are never more than a quick Google search away.","","","","2011-10-23","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

I said <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/10/amazon_hegemony.html"">when I talked</a> about the Kindle Fire (=Amazon's lower-price cousin of the iPad) that Amazon weren't shy of selling at or below cost. They do it with regular books and e-books, so it would probably appeal to them to do it with the Fire. Well, Amazon's profits are <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/oct/25/amazon-usa"">down 73%</a> for this previous quarter despite sales being up. Sales up but margin down could imply serious capital investment (though I think the timing would be peculiar) but it has to include lots of below cost selling too. 

That's slightly worrying because it represents a gamble. Why would you sell e-readers, and perhaps e-books too, at a price that loses you money? Because you plan to make it all back - and more besides - once you've cornered a chunk of the market. If Amazon weren't planning to establish at least a partial monopoly and then extract monopoly profits I can't see why they would have allowed their margin to drop like this. Apple, by contrast, don't pay you to buy their iPads - they make a good profit on every one, so when their sales are up, so are their profits.

It seems clear to me that Amazon are intending to control a fat chunk of the e-book market. I still have no suggestions for how that control might be loosened a little, but it's probably worth spreading the word about it while there's time to plan a response.

And to be clear, I think a lot of the reason for Amazon's success is that they do a better job and are smarter than their competitors. But I think they want to be the only game in town and I want us to retain some choice (which might also help us retain some profit margins).","","","","","2011-10-26","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

This is more of a personal, philosophical musing (oh great!) than a Snowbooks thing but I've been thinking a lot about perfectionism lately. When I worked in big business they tended to think in terms of <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"">Voltaire's suggestion</a> that ""<span style=""font-family: courier;"">Le mieux est l'ennemi du bien</span>."" Only, because they'd really taken that to heart (and had no idea who Voltaire was) it tended to get mistranslated as ""The great is the enemy of the good"" which admittedly scans better in English. There was also much talk of the 80/20 rule, which no one could ever really define for me (are you spotting a theme yet?), but which I think came from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle"">Pareto's principle</a> that 80% of effects (sometimes) come from 20% of the causes. Thus 80% of the benefits (maybe) come from 20% of the work. Which was taken as a warning that you might have to enormously extend the length of a project just to get a final few percent benefit at the end of it. In theory, if Pareto's principle held, you could get 80% of the benefit on five different projects in the same time you could get 100% of one project ( 5  x 20% = 1 x 100% ).

Perfectionism in most of the large organisations I've worked with was considered to be a species of idealism, which is something that purportedly sits down the opposite end of the spectrum from hard-headed, practical, commercially-viable pragmatism. Not only was perfectionism a way of getting less benefit from your efforts (see above), it was suspected of being an excuse for never delivering your project at all.

I come across the same thing sometimes when I talk to people about writing. The <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wikiquote:Reference_desk/Archive/4#...merely_abandoned"">variously-attributed</a> epigram that a work is never completed, it is merely abandoned comes from the idea that we would tinker until doomsday if we weren't forced, by some external deadline, to hand over what we've done.

And all of that is probably true, but I think there are one or two things that also need to be taken into account. One is that criticism and praise are not always assigned in comparable ways. Drawbacks can carry different weights from benefits. I see this most often in customer service: getting a hundred tiny things right can be completely erased by getting one thing wrong. In many situations, zero failures is the most important statistic; doing something impressive is irrelevant until all the negatives are erased. This is as true of good service and public relations as it is of air traffic control.","But that's a very pedestrian form of perfectionism: not making any mistakes. I'm also interested in the perfectionism of not watering down your goals. Jeff Bezos, who I seem to be talking about a lot lately, did a brave thing when he created Amazon. He resisted the pressure to compromise when told that his goal of offering a million titles was uncommercial. Offering three-hundred-thousand titles would cost <em>vastly</em> less and deliver most of the benefits because of the 80/20 rule. Hardly anyone buys those titles languishing in the bottom deciles of the million-title bestseller charts. But Jeff <a href=""http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.01/bezos.html"">stuck to his guns</a>. And, to a great extent, that's what made Amazon special. It was where you could get all the titles that weren't available anywhere else. It invented the idea that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail"">the long tail</a> could be profitable. By refusing to take a more 'commercial' approach, Amazon invented a new category of 'commercial' that was much larger.

Apparently Steve Jobs felt that Apple's biggest mistake after he left was to focus on making profit. Ironically it seems - at least for Steve Jobs - that the best way to make money is to focus on making something sensational and new and as perfect as he could get it to be. And the worst way to make money is to <a href=""http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-10-23/tech/30312644_1_apple-steve-jobs-profits"">focus on making money</a>.

That's what perfectionism can lead to: a redefinition of the rules, a reinvention of the industry, the creation of a completely new <em>thing</em>. It doesn't help you make money in the old way, but it might help you make much more money in some totally new way. If making money is your thing. And if it's not, why would you ever think of compromising your standards? Why wouldn't you try to get things exactly right?

That's the final thing I notice about perfectionism: that it's a much better source of pride than following the 80/20 rule. When I worked in big businesses, I worked on a lot of projects that were about delivering a clone of something that already existed elsewhere. They were 'me too' projects. And none of them ever really made anyone proud or changed the world. There was much talk about why it was stupid, childish even, to dream of creating something perfect, but none of those 'good enough' projects achieved very much.

I think that self-esteem is more important than money, because without self-esteem you're buggered. And I think perfectionism is the best route to the former and a preferable route to riches (if that's your goal). 'Perfectionism' can be just another way of saying that you want to do something exactly and precisely in your own way to the very best of your abilities without letting anyone else muck it up or water it down. Everyone should have a few of those projects to their name (be they big and commercial or tiny and personal) even if the price they pay for creating them is very high. Because, speaking from personal experience, those are the only endeavours you look back on and really feel good about.","","","","2011-10-28","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

I just spent ten minutes in the Kobo app on my iPad trying to figure out how to buy a book. I couldn't do it. I decided to stop after ten minutes so I could share my experience. Plus I was a bit cross. I know I succeeded once before because I managed to buy Caitlan Moran's wonderful book. (Normally I buy all my books through the Amazon Kindle US store, but they didn't have that one - doubtless for terribly good reasons that in the end come down to a lost sale.) I did find what seemed like four or five ways I could share what I'm reading on social media (not that I'm reading anything because I can't buy books, but <em>theoretically</em> I could share). I also had lots of messages about features, at least two settings buttons, and a page of awards I'd received (I actually do think they were for me not for authors I was reading (not that I'm reading any, etc, etc)). But I could not find a link to a book store or a way to get more titles. Maybe you'd like to have a go yourself. Click on the thumbnail above to get a full-sized picture and then tell me what you'd do to find a bookstore. And if anyone knows the answer, please remind me in the comments.

Finding the iPad Kobo app to be a roadblock on the e-book highway (see <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/10/kobo_grrrrrrr.html"">previous pos</a>t) I thought I'd try buying the book I was after direct from the publisher. Which in this case was Allen Page, which is now the faintest echo of an independent imprint within the Penguin site. Signs of shoddiness everywhere on the Penguin site, to my way of thinking at least, and the hardback version of the book I was after gave a publication date of Thursday (two days ago) but also claimed it was not published yet. However the e-book was available!

Their purchasing process was also a bit on the shoddy side and required a couple of attempts to get through it. But at last I had the opportunity to download my e-book. Except that the file when it arrived was only 1kb. What? Oh right, it's an Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) file which, when opened by the application of that name, will download the actual book. Wasn't expecting ADE. It just said EPUB on the purchase page. So will I be able to read this thing using an EPUB reader on my iPad? From what I can tell, the answer is 'no'. Will I be able to read it on my laptop - which of course I don't really want to do? Well, in theory you can, but the Adobe Digital Editions website where I can download their software tells me ""Sorry, but your system doesn't meet the minimum system requirements"". That must be because I'm using a two-month-old Mac with the latest version of everything. Or maybe there's no such thing as Adobe Digital Editions and this is all an elaborate con and the ghost of Allen Lane is in on it. So far not much to show for my 11.99. Certainly nothing to read (if you don't count error messages).

Anyway, you can imagine how likely I am to want to try the Kobo route (<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/10/kobo_grrrrrrr.html"">previous pos</a>t) or the Penguin route again. If the remnants of Allen Lane had released the e-book I want in the States as well as in the UK this week then I would have been reading it for the last hour instead of wandering through a maze of shoddy interfaces and incompatible standards (admittedly Amazon have incompatible standards too, but they have working readers for everything, so far as I can tell. Everything. So it hasn't caused me a moment's bother.) We really had better hope that Amazon are the good guys, because you'd be mad to shop for e-books anywhere else, at least based on my recent experience.
<hr/>

<em>Update</em>: I cracked it. There's an Adobe page for people who can't install Digital Editions software on a Mac. Instead of scanning your system and telling you that it won't work it just lets you download and install a copy... which works.

And that's the point at which I did something bad. I'd read a few dozen blog posts about people wishing they could read their ADE EPUBs on their iPads. And lots of people explaining how to do it... if you didn't mind making a few shady deals in dark alleys. And I did it. I cracked the DRM on the ADE version, and transferred it to the iPad to read in the Apple iBooks reader. I wonder how much trouble I'm in. I paid my 11.99 to Penguin but now I'm reading it on the wrong piece of machinery. What should my punishment be? (also note: the method I chose to use only works if you start with a legally purchased copy that happens to be in an inconvenient format - though I suspect I could upload my hacked copy and anyone could read it now - which I won't do, of course.)

And incidentally - or maybe not incidentally at all - it took less time to research the hack, download all the relevant software and get the EPUB ready to read on a device it wasn't authorised for than it did to pay my money and get to a position where I could read it on my laptop (yuck!). Another argument in favour of the Kindle store: Amazon is quick, piracy is slow - we just have to make sure that Amazon alternatives aren't slower still.","","","","","2011-10-29","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

I hope you don't mind me putting these thoughts here. I don't have a good alternative outlet for them. I want to say what I think is going on with the Occupy protests on Wall Street, outside St Paul's and elsewhere. Hopefully you've seen the protests in the news. Depending on where you get your information you might think they're scroungers or treehuggers or extremists or perhaps you think they're standing up for our rights. Of course they're not a single movement; they're lots of people annoyed about lots of different things who don't see a better way to make their point. And I think they might be right about that.","I'm sure the Occupy 'movement' includes lots of people who think capitalism is just plain wrong. But I suspect for everyone who feels that, there are a dozen who want capitalism to get rid of its double-standards (e.g. bailouts predominantly for the rich) and to lean a little towards socialism and not so much towards the hardline free-market where providing any sort of social safety is seen as an 'imperfect market'.

I think a lot of this starts with the idea of 'special interests'. That's a term that used to get bandied around in the States a great deal and it revealed an important point. If a few people were passionate about doing something and a lot of people were apathetic about stopping it, the few could get their way, even in a democracy where supposedly the majority always has their say. A special interest group couldn't necessarily raise enough votes for their cause, but they could make use of other political pressure points. In other words, there are ways to punch above your weight - to achieve more leverage than the one-man-one-vote rule might imply. And if everyone else is asleep then special interests often prevail.

I think originally when people decried 'special interest' groups they were thinking of pet projects or slightly wacko zealots wanting to spend public money on freeway tunnels for woodland creatures to cross the road or religious groups wanting to ban the word 'Xmas'.

You see a form of it in the NIMBYism of wind farms. As a whole, the country wants wind farms. But they want them in a vague, leave-it-to-others kind of way. Whereas individual communities often don't want them. And they don't want them in a passionate, handing out leaflets, holding meetings, heckling officials kind of way. The masses don't have a particular site in mind, they just want the job done. So wind farms will almost certainly end up wherever local organisation is weakest not necessarily where they suit the UK's energy demands best. (Disclaimer: I like wind farms and would actually like one near me.)

So special interests can get their way by being organised and passionate even though the majority oppose them. Because the majority are disorganised and not paying attention and don't have an easy way to express their preferences. Voting one way or the other in elections is a very blunt instrument indeed when it comes to influencing the hundreds of policy and regulatory and budgetary decisions that go on around us - especially when most of us have no time or motivation to stay informed about this stuff.

Now imagine what happens if you add money to the combination of organisation and passion. Some part of the democratic process always costs money and if you can find it, and spend your money wisely, then you can apply leverage out of proportion to the number of votes you command. Again, it's about punching above your weight in a democracy.

In America there's a very easy way to buy your influence. Somehow America has ended up with a televised approach to elections, particularly at state, congressional and presidential level. You get your message out on TV spots and your opponents hit back using the same medium. The whole things costs a fortune. I've seen lots of different estimates but it seems to cost more than a million dollars to get into the House of Representatives, over five million to become a senator and several hundred million to become president (I suspect all those figures are very much on the low side because I took them from older sources).

Given that successful candidates will be ones who, among other things, raised enough money to get elected it stands to reason that there'd a natural tendency for those with rich friends to have a headstart over those with poor friends. You need a loooot of poor friends to raise a million bucks, but one rich friend might do the trick. Or you could be rich yourself, then you don't need so many friends - or 'supporters' if you prefer that term.

Take a look at this fun chart that's doing the rounds:
<img alt=""PercentageMillionairesCongress.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/PercentageMillionairesCongress.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""330"" />

That's got to have an effect on how legislators see the world compared with the views of 'ordinary people'. Taxing millionaires at a high rate is bound to be more popular outside congress than within it. Take into account that a very large fraction of politician's re-election funds are also going to be from millionaires, who most likely don't want to be taxed more heavily, and it's easy to see how Bush era tax cuts for the wealthy could come about during a war (an almost unprecedented occurrence - the American War of Independence being the only other example I could find).

Now ideally, there'd be just as many pressure groups pushing in the other direction. In some ways it will be an unequal battle, because poor people can't compete with rich on a contribution-per-capita basis. But if what the rich are pushing for is unpopular enough, the poor should have the advantage in numbers.

If you're around a hundred years old you might remember unions as heroic alliances of working people who forced businesses to pay disability to injured workers and pensions to those too old to work. If you're around fifty years old, you might think of unions as workshy Marxists intent on bringing industry to a halt with their knee-jerk strikes. If you're twenty years old, you might not really have had any experience of unions. Before the second-world-war, workers' movements and unions were powerful enough to have their own newspapers. These days, national news outlets belong to massive, global media conglomerates like News International or Clear Channel or ViaCom or ComCast. These are huge businesses which could not have existed fifty years ago because of laws about media 'concentration'. 

Media companies didn't used to be permitted to get too big and too broad for fear that they could slant the news. Those restrictions have been weakened over the years and now we get most of our news from giant corporations. It's hardly surprising if sometimes those giant corporations show some pro-corporate bias. They're not about to campaign for their own destruction - and so by extension they're unlikely to start mud-slinging competitions with any other giant corporations.

In the last fifty years or so, news media has become more pro-corporate because most news media is generated by corporations. Newspapers and news TV have also come to rely ever more heavily on advertising. And advertising is very rarely about poor people sending messages to big corporations: it's nearly always the other way round. So the rare news corporation that agitates for corporate restraint is unlikely to impress its advertising clients.

And finally there is something called 'access journalism'. If you call a top politician a crook you may never get another interview from anyone in government. If you try to blow the whistle on a corrupt corporation you may attract the mother of all lawsuits. If you 'go along to get along' you may find that you can get quotes and interviews from the rich and influential, that you get the best tip-offs of what's about to happen, and you have access to the inside story. Make powerful enemies and you may quickly become useless to your editors: persona non grata in all the places that count. Not to mention that really dogged investigative journalism costs a lot of money as well as making powerful enemies - and it's not even that popular with readers. No wonder celebrity news is forever on the rise while 'hard news' dwindles.

You can sometimes get away with going after a 'rotten apple' or a 'black sheep' but going after the system itself is rarely a good idea for a journalist - even supposing his bosses wanted to run the story. The BBC got into a lot of trouble for their 'sexing up' the case for war reporting - even though they were right. Dan Rather lost his job for a story which was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killian_documents_controversy"">accurate</a>. And no one even expects Murdoch's papers to try when it comes to policing those at the top (assuming they're toeing the News International line) 

And over those same fifty years of increasing media 'concentration' the traditional counter-balancing organisations on the labour side have dwindled and lost their status. I can't remember the last time I saw a positive portrayal of a union either in fiction or in the news. Perhaps unions themselves are to blame, but we have nothing to replace them with, so inevitably the scales have tipped towards corporations.

Fortunately, innovations like the internet have opened the floodgates when it comes to 'ordinary people' figuring out what's happening in the world. Fox News might not cover the Murdoch phone-hacking scandal, but a two-second Google search can uncover plenty of information. Of course you need to get tipped off somehow in order to go searching - and you need to feel motivated to do so. The latter in particular - motivation - seems to have been in decline ever since the militant Sixties.

For decades, corporations have been gently (and not so gently) pushing for what they want and they've naturally used methods other than the ballot paper to get their way because those methods work best for them. America has recently - and I think ridiculously - taken the legal fiction that a corporation is, in some sense, an 'individual' and argued that it therefore enjoys free speech protection <super><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html"">[1]</a></super>. Which in turn means that it should not be subject to limits over its political donations. Corporations in America can now donate huge sums to politicians who they believe will represent their interests. 

Another factor that's worth considering when looking for corporate bias is what happens to politicians once they are out of office. The Bush Administration particularly did a roaring trade in recruiting 'regulators' from within the industries they were supposed to regulate and then allowing them to take highly paid consultant positions back within those industries when their public offices came to an end. Some of these consultant positions are offered while the official still holds public office - which certainly raises the possibility of implicit strings being attached. And some of these ex-public officials offer their services as experts in how to effectively (and legally, of course) manipulate the system. Needless to say, poor people are not paying these consultants' fees; it's all big business, especially big businesses who either wish to be laxly regulated or who do a lot of business with the government (such as defence contractors).

This 'revolving door' makes sense to some: how could an outsider responsibly oversee an industry they were unfamiliar with? On the other hand, what about the stakeholders who are affected by that industry but not part of it? Does the logging industry have sufficient incentives to protect forests? Do pharmaceutical companies have sufficient incentives to offer affordable medicines? Are credit card companies in favour of cancelling debts for those bankrupted by medical bills? Do defence contractors ever lobby for less militarisation or smaller wars? I believe the answer to all those questions is 'no'. (This malaise even has a formal name in economics: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture"">Regulatory Capture</a>: where an oversight agency turns from master to slave.)

Corporations have become better and better at getting what they want, not because they're evil (though I sometimes think some of them are) but because that's their job. And there are very few effective institutions for pushing back. They have also got better and better at cutting wages over the years. Not the top wages, but the wages of everyone in the lower levels of the organisational pyramid. And they've got better at paying less corporate taxes - or being granted more tax 'credits' - or even getting the relevant tax rates lowered for the whole industry. Very rich people who mainly pay capital gains tax rather than income tax have had similar good fortune over the last fifty years.

Even if 'ordinary people' do take an interest in a cause, there is relatively little they can do about it - or so it seems. Governments invite community feedback, but often ignore it. They do backroom deals. They rush bills into legislation. They appoint advisers and make use of massive consultancies all of whom are from big-business backgrounds (or are big businesses) and it's difficult to imagine how an ordinary citizen could get a seat at the table in any of those processes.

Take a look at this graph (from the <a href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2011/01/why_corporate_tax_reform_will.html"">Washington Post</a>) about U.S. <i>effective</i> rates of corporate tax. That's not the official rate (which is one of the highest in the world), but what corporations actually end up paying (which is one of the lowest rates in the world):
<img alt=""taxratescorporate.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/taxratescorporate.jpg"" width=""476"" height=""301"" />

And look at Warren Buffett has to say (New York Times <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/stop-coddling-the-super-rich.html?_r=1"">link</a>) about the tax he pays on his income compared with the tax his secretary pays. His tax rate ends up being below 18% compared to an average of 36% for people in his office. 

Or look at this graph for what has happened to incomes in America in the last thirty years (<a href=""http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/income-inequality-in-america-chart-graph"">source</a>):
<img alt=""inequality-p25_averagehouseholdincom.png"" src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/inequality-p25_averagehouseholdincom.png"" width=""631"" height=""346"" />

What it all means is that each year the status quo gets nudged a little in favour of those who are organised, mobilised, canny and well-funded. The one remaining arena in which the ill-informed and unmotivated person in the street gets to have their say is elections. But even here they are choosing between political parties all of which have close big-business ties. You see this particularly clearly in America where the Republicans are ferociously pro-corporate in power and the Democrats are merely ineffectual. The Republicans get big-business donations for pushing a corporate agenda; the Democrats get big-business donations for not standing in their way.

And then came the Iraq War. After which came the Banking Crisis. The war was an example of something very unpopular which went ahead despite massive opposition. People marched in their millions but saw very little of their opposition reflected back via the news media. Lots of people mistrusted the reasons for the war and their scepticism proved to be accurate. But those in power hinted all along that they were privy to secret information which vindicated their position. Later when that vindication was found to be illusory, politicians fell back on claiming that they did their best and merely trusted what they were told. This did not go over well with those outside of government who smelled a rat years before politicians came (partially) clean on the flimsiness of their secret proof.

The Iraq occupation merely proved that 'ordinary people' are out of the loop when it comes to making these decisions. And the excuse of 'how could we have known in advance this was a bad idea' was trotted out again during the banking crisis. All those who had been warning of disaster had long since been labelled as cranks. So that the only people commenting on the crisis were those who thought it would never happen. 

Outside of the banking industry lots of people thought there was a problem. Inside the industry very few could see it. And because regulators, advisers and even professional pundits tended to be 'industry experts' and thus insiders, there has still been relatively little acceptance within the financial industry that the crisis was avoidable. Many outside experts see the sidelining of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Act_of_1933"">Glass-Steagall Acts</a> in 1999 as the moment the rot set in. After the Great Depression, America had created rules which prevented banks from acting too much like financial gambling institutions. By the closing years of the Clinton Administration, the buoyant economic climate and the passing of so many decades made it possible to relax those rules without causing too much panic. And so began a huge speculative bubble which is still in the process of bursting.

And of course speculative bubbles are all about getting spectacularly rich. A lot of lobbying went in to creating a climate where that could happen. As Senator Dick Durbin said, despite having caused the financial crisis, those same firms <code>""are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill. And they, frankly, own the place.""</code> A New York Times article which mentions that quote also says that between 1990 and 2010, financial firms spent $2.3bn on federal campaign contributions.  (<a href=""http://mobile.nytimes.com/article;jsessionid=74982677818F62BAFBFA3FB44ADB447A.w5?a=860524&single=1&f=28"">source</a>). Would they have kept spending after that first <em>billion</em> if they weren't getting some sort of acceptable return on their investment?

All of which is enough to make any 'ordinary citizen' suspect that their government does what Wall Street tells them. So why isn't it Wall Street who pays the bills? 'Ordinary people' are being told they've got a stupendous amount of national debt to pay off. They could surely be forgiven for wondering why it's now their problem.

Take a look at this chart from the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/opinion/sunday/24sun4.html"">New York Times</a> showing where America's huge deficit has come from:
<img alt=""NYTDeficitChart.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/NYTDeficitChart.jpg"" width=""450"" height=""500"" />
Look at the first column. The first chunk is for wars that were controversial to say the least and certainly do not seem to have achieved their publicly-stated aims. The second chunk is tax cuts for the wealthy. And the fourth is the bank bailouts. The fifth was largely about allowing pharmaceutical companies to charge Medicare more for drugs than they get paid in other countries. Add in the fact that a lot of 'stimulus spending' under the Obama government hasn't actually gone to helping out poor people in debt, it's gone to protecting corporations from the fall-out of their actions and you can see why austerity for all might not be popular. 

Austerity only for the middle and working classes is clearly even more unpopular given how much of a hand they had in spending all that money or how much benefit they reaped from it. The rich haven't had to give back their tax cuts. The bankers haven't had to give back their bonuses. The trillions spent on war haven't done a thing to help ordinary American people. And what's more, many of them opposed all three of those things. But now it's time for them to foot the bill. They know the news media won't help them. They know their elected officials will turn a deaf ear. They suspect that one-off marches won't even make the news. So a few of them have camped out not in front of the White House, but in front of Wall Street. Not at the end of Downing Street but in the City of London. Because that's where the real power is. It's where governments go to get their marching orders. (The City of London is <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/oct/31/corporation-london-city-medieval"">not even subject</a> to some of the laws which apply to the rest of Britain.)

And, as this rather fine <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/10/how_ows_confuses_and_ignores_fox_news_and_the_pundit_class_.html"">article</a> points out, these people are holding signs rather than giving interviews because it's much more difficult to twist someone's words if they're written down.

I think that the potential support for these Occupy protests is vast. There is a largely-invisible head of pressure that's built up over the last few decades of which the Occupy protests are just a hint: like wisps of steam from a volcano that might no longer be dormant. Ordinary people know that things aren't really going their way. They know that politicians are heavily swayed by what big business wants. And they suspect what that means: that people who have unexceptionable jobs and who make their money from salaries not investments will be slightly worse off each year in real terms. And those who fall through the gaps are increasingly likely to find no social safety net beneath them. Funding for safety nets is being eaten up in rescuing banks and bailing out corporations. Read <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/owss-beef-wall-street-isnt-winning-its-cheating-20111025"">this article</a> from Rolling Stone magazine if you want to get really angry about how handouts in America are only for the wealthy. We might all be happier about staunch capitalists if they refused bailouts and went down with their ships - as their economic philosophies tell them they must. But somehow, they are never hoist by their own petards. Free market doctrine does not seem to preclude corporate safety nets only social ones.

So I tend to believe that the Occupy protests are actually in nearly everyone's interests. And they effectively make the point that permitted forms of protest have been systematically nullified so that there's little point in writing to your MP or voting differently in an election as a way to make your voice heard. A whole infrastructure of leverage has been erected around the political process to make sure that the powerful have a means to exercise that power. I have no idea what the Occupy protests will achieve, whether they will peter out or even if there is a way forward which would address their grievances. But I certainly sympathise with their aims and applaud their sacrifice (perhaps this <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/10/27/BAD61LN3LM.DTL"">man's</a> most of all).","","","","2011-10-30","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

So, if you read this blog, or if you keep up with this stuff already, then you'll know that Amazon is replacing its current e-book format (based on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobipocket"">Mobipocket</a>) with KF8, which is based on the latest web standards. The old Amazon/Mobipocket format was also based on web standards, but from a few years ago. KF8 brings things up-to-date by using HTML5/CSS3. Those are also the standards you'd be looking at if you were considering a snazzy makeover of your website. On the web, <a href=""http://www.alistapart.com/articles/previewofhtml5"">HTML5</a> allows designers to do a number of cool things which they could only do previously if they added lots of behind-the-scenes code (=javascript) to their web pages or they used a third-party platform like Flash or Air or Silverlight. With HTML5, a web page can do a lot of that with no extra code required. HTML5 lets you make use of embedded fonts, lots of new layout commands, transparency, custom-curved corners to shapes, animated transitions - and it can better tailor its behaviour to the device it's being displayed on.

Presumably not all of these new web features will make it into KF8, but there's talk of ""embedded fonts, drop caps and CSS selectors such as line spacing, alignment, justification, margin, color, style and borders.<sup><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/01/kindle-fire-code-base-kf8/"">[1]</a></sup>"" One of the things I'm looking forward to (which I <em>think</em> is supported) is footnotes implemented as popups, rather than as jumps to another page. I'm also hoping that we can have e-books laid out with the same attention to detail as paper books have always enjoyed.

What I haven't seen much information on yet is the tools publishers can use to create these better, more beautiful e-books.","We've been gradually trawling our way through what's available for the creation of current-generation e-books - the software that takes our print-ready layouts and gets them ready for the Kindle platform - and it's not particularly impressive. Unless new e-book-oriented tools appear soon, I imagine most of the potential for better, KF8-based Kindle e-books will remain untapped for now. On the other hand, Amazon are not likely to create a juggernaut of a media-delivery system, the way they have, and overlook the fact that it will need some new content. Is Amazon working with their favourite publishers on KF8 showcase titles? Has anyone caught glimpses of where this new content is going to come from?

The two scenarios I can picture are a) KF8 starts off as a damp squib because there are hardly any e-books available that properly demonstrate its capabilities or b) there's a two-tier system where publishers who are within Amazon's fold launch cool-looking titles in time for Christmas while the rest of us press our grubby faces against the glass. Option b sounds a little more likely to me because it assumes that Amazon are on-the-ball. Given that Amazon have pre-sold at least half a million Kindle Fires,<sup>[<a href=""http://mashable.com/2011/10/10/kindle-fire-preorders/"">1</a>]</sup>, we're talking about a pretty major launch here. That said, option b is not exactly desirable from the point of view of us urchin publishers out in the relative cold.","","","","2011-11-03","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

I think we might actually suggest some guidelines for self-publishing at some stage, but we haven't organised our thoughts well enough for that yet. In the meantime, I thought I'd share a link I came across while getting to grips with our 'e-book creation workflow' (as I rather grandly like to think of our attempts to make really nice Kindle books). The link on the Amazon page said, ""Publishers can also self-publish content as a blog or news feed using Kindle Publishing for Blogs beta"". And the page it led to said, ""Amazon Kindle Publishing for Blogs is a fast and easy self-publishing tool that lets you add and sell your blogs on the Kindle Store."" That, so far, is the entire extent of my research, but it sounds like one more route to market for your words. <a href=""https://kindlepublishing.amazon.com/gp/vendor/sign-in/184-3547131-5302402"">Link</a>.","","","","","2011-11-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

This post isn't going to make any sense to you unless you're creating Kindle e-books by using Amazon's plugin to InDesign. But if you <em>are</em> making e-books that way, there's a bug you might like to know about. The plugin lives <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621"">here</a>, by the way. It's a beta release and it's flaky, but it's still very useful. The bug I'm referring to is in the 0.95 version (which is the latest as I'm writing this - and I'm using it with InDesign CS5.5 for Mac). The problem is that if you choose the wrong settings when using the plugin, the e-book creation process ignores page breaks in your source file. What that means is that text that's on different pages in your InDesign file ends up on the same page in the finished e-book. You can insert more page breaks into the InDesign document but they have no effect. But with the correct settings, those page breaks do what you'd expect them to and trigger a new page in the e-book wherever they appear.

So what's the setting which controls whether page breaks are honoured? I'll give you a clue: it's not called 'Ignore page breaks'. No. It's the setting marked 'Footnote location'. If you tell the plugin to put the footnotes at the end of chapters ('Before break / new chapter'), then page breaks are honoured. If you choose the 'In place' setting, page breaks are ignored. Of course that makes no sense and is clearly a bug. But if you don't know it's there you could spend hours trying to work out why your Kindle books have all their text smushed together... like I did. Click the thumbnail picture to see the dialog I'm talking about. 

<code>[Update</code>: despite what I said in the rest of this post, 'In place' is not the default setting. I got it wrong. More details <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/11/humiliating_bug_climb_down.html"">here</a>.<code>]</code>","I can't actually imagine who wants their footnotes to appear in the body text of the document. Certainly we don't. So probably very few people choose that setting. Except that it's the default. And if you happen to be starting out and trying to get the plugin to work, you might not realise you have to get the correct footnote setting at the outset or the rest of the process will be derailed.

(And while I generally hope Amazon don't read this blog because I'm so rude about them, if they <em>are</em> reading this: might you guys consider making that plug-in open source? It doesn't seem to create any DRM so presumably it's not doing anything secret, given that Kindle e-books use the well-known mobi format. If you open-sourced the plug-in, folks like me could fix all the bugs and add all sorts of cool extra features and you could cherry-pick the stuff you liked for the official release. Better for you; better for us; better for the whales*.)

So, a lot of people think of me as a bit of a trendsetter*. And when it comes to the technology I use, I'm always getting asked to share my nifty secrets*. That's probably because I tend to be up to date with all that's cool and useful when it comes to web-related tricks and tips*. 

*not true

But (semi-)seriously, here are a couple of things I'm getting lots of benefits from at the moment. First, I recommend using a service like <a href=""http://www.instapaper.com/faq"">Instapaper</a>. The idea is that you can clip whatever you like from the web for later perusal. Most of the common browsers let you add Instapaper functionality. And you can set it up so that whatever you've clipped is available on whichever machine you want. Clip interesting articles at work and then read them on your phone while traveling home, for instance. For a less useful version of the same thing, you could just synchronise your browser bookmarks between computers, using something like <a href=""http://www.xmarks.com/"">XMarks</a>. Not as handy, but XMarks can synchronise passwords as well as bookmarks. Or you could use the Safari browser which now comes with a 'reading list'. If you happen to use an iPhone or an iPad (and you keep your phone's software up-to-date) then you also have access to that same Safari reading list on those devices. On a side note: I'm also loving Safari's new '<a href=""http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20007195-263.html"">Reader</a>' button: it takes all the clutter out of a web-page and formats it like an article in a book. It even makes the text a sensible size. It's a much easier way to read longer pieces of text, and again it's available on iOS devices as well as Macs and PCs. (There's a plug-in for Firefox called '<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reader/"">Reader</a>' which attempts to do the same thing.)","If you want to go one step further with the clipping of articles, you could use <a href=""https://www.evernote.com/about/home.php"">Evernote</a>. It too synchronises across multiple platforms (including iPhones and iPads) but it lets you organise your clippings into notes within notebooks, and it has some cool extra features. You can mix clippings with rich text and images, as well as audio and video notes, and goodness knows what else. Plus - and this often seems like magic - you can paste an image into Evernote and it will read any text in the image and include that text in any searches you later run. So, use your iPhone's camera to photograph a restaurant receipt while in the Evernote app and then later, maybe on your home computer, you could search for 'Death by chocolate' and it will bring up the receipt's photo. Neat-o to a spooky extent.

And all of those things are available in free versions. Though some, like Evernote, are cool enough that I happily pay for some extra bell-like and whistle-related enhancements.

I hope at least some of that is somewhat useful to at least some of you.","","","","2011-11-06","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

I know I do this occasionally, but I had another of those we're-living-in-the-future moments the other day. I was reading an article about micro-controllers because that's the sort of person I am. The article started with a reminiscence about the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_1"">Cray 1</a> Supercomputer. Cray 1s still look like something out of science fiction. They built seats into it so that you could sit round the edge and it had a central column like the time rotor in the Tardis. In 1976 it was the world's first proper supercomputer. Its incredible processing capacity required vast amounts of electricity: 115 kilowatts (equivalent to fifty household electric heaters on full blast). In fact most of the computer was taken up by its liquid cooling system.

Today you can get a chip that does the same job. It costs about five pounds and it consumes 1 watt. So you could run sixty of them on the same amount of electricity used by an old-fashioned light bulb. So can you think of anything you might need a supercomputer for, because chances are you own a couple.","","","","","2011-11-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Yesterday I (finally) wrote a script to turn an image of any size into one of the little thumbnails that you see next to SnowBlog posts. It's written in JavaScript and you call it from within Photoshop - in fact I gave it its own shortcut key. It instantly does something which normally takes me a minute or so to do manually. Not a big deal, but then I waste that minute every time I write a blog post. And worse still I know I'm wasting that minute as it happens. The script more or less instantly does the following:
* Flattens any layers leaving the image and the background
* Resizes the image to be 280 pixels wide, while maintaining its shape
* Resizes the canvas so it's just a bit bigger than the image (we need room for a drop shadow)
* Nudges the image out of the top-left corner (so we can select around its edge if we want)
* Applies a pre-defined style to the image (you can't apply drop shadow and outer glow from the code)
* Selects the area outside the image, feathers the selection and then removes it to give a soft edge
It didn't take me long to write and would be much faster if I wrote a few similar scripts. I've also written scripts to automate my use of InDesign (although it's actually not me who does our typesetting). You write these things, drop them in the correct directory, and suddenly they're available to run from Photoshop or InDesign (or Illustrator or what-have-you). What I'm wondering is: if I showed you guys how to do that stuff would anyone be interested? Would anyone write their own scripts? I don't think it's difficult to write these things - fiddly, but not difficult - plus the standard is merely 'good enough' not 'commercial quality' - but then I'm maybe more used to programming than most publishers. Maybe you feel the same way about the prospect of writing a few lines of code as you would about learning quantum mechanics. I'm happy to share a bit of simple guidance and a worked example if there's some demand, but I can't really gauge if most people would get a kick out of automating and customising the tools they use or if that's more of a nerdy/Rob/just-me thing. Thoughts?

"42542","","1","Amazon below cost? Part two.","Publish","true","<div class=""pic""><img src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/AmazonMonopoly.jpg""/></div>

I was pontificating <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/10/amazon_below_cost.html"">recently</a> on the fact that Amazon are happy to sell at or below cost as a strategic investment. The phrase 'strategic investment' in that last sentence you will recognise as business speak for 'attempting to buy market share'. And now <a href=""http://www.mainstreet.com/article/smart-spending/technology/exclusive-amazon-s-79-kindle-touch-costs-84-make"">here's an article</a> suggesting that the latest Kindle reader might cost more than they're being sold for. (And incidentally, could Amazon start giving their e-readers model names again, please. 'The one they've been selling since last year' and 'the one they're just about to ship' are not good names.)

As for selling below cost, I certainly have mixed feelings about that strategy. As I said before, the problem comes not so much from a corporation choosing to give things away, but from what it might want in return. I'm concerned that the idea behind 'dumping' product at below cost is to make the market temporarily unprofitable for everyone else in order to drive out the competition - after which Amazon could bump the prices back up, conceivably even higher than they started out. Not only is a move like that about reducing competition in the long run, it's a strategy only open to those with deep pockets. And that in itself is an important point: I can't say for sure that Amazon are intending to extract 'monopoly profits' from the book/e-book market once they're in a strongly dominant position, all I can do is look at what all this selling-at-a-loss must be costing them and worry about how they intend to make it all back (and more besides, presumably).","","","","","2011-11-11","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

Curses. Now two people <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/11/save_time_people_automate.html#comments"">have asked</a> that I take you through the Photoshop script I recently wrote. And one of those people I actually know, so now I suppose I'll have to do it. Even though I know all you other people reading this now aren't going to bother with it. You'll stop reading in a paragraph or two because something shiny will catch your eye or X Factor will be on or, now that I've mentioned X Factor, you'll realise you'd like to go to the Daily Mail website and catch up on the latest sizzling gossip. So here is a link for <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?sel=site&searchPhrase=x+factor"">that</a>.

Ahem. Now the rest of you open your textbooks to chapter three and we'll begin.","Here's a <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/SnowblogPrep.jsx"">link to download the script</a> I wrote. I thought about prettifying it up a bit, but then I thought that leaving it rough around the edges would make the point that you can cobble these things together quickly and change them whenever you need to. (And note, it assumes you've created a layer style called 'Snowblog' and tries to apply it. <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/designcenter/photoshop/articles/phs8lyrstyl.html"">This</a> is how you create a layer style in case you want to try running the script. Go to the <a href=""#running"">bottom</a> of this post for info on how to run scripts in Photoshop. If you want to look at the script you can open it with NotePad on Windows or TextEdit on OSX - it's just text, so any text editor is fine. But if you want to make changes to it, don't use something complicated like Microsoft Word because it'll try to add lots of formatting. Use NotePad or TextEdit or something similar.)

Remember it's a script for preparing images so I can use them on the SnowBlog as thumbnails alongside the posts. I wrote it in JavaScript which is the web's first choice for little snippets of useful code (though Adobe programs allow other languages). The good thing about the script that we're going to work through is that we can largely tackle it a line at a time. Each line, or little block of lines (known as 'statements'), is fairly self-contained and each does a separate thing. In fact I could probably rewrite the script so that you could delete any one line and it would only knock out a single step in the process: all the rest would work. If you think about that for a moment, that's quite a heartening thought because it means you can write your own scripts simply by assembling lines from other people's scripts or from examples - of which there are many. 

So, let's start with this chunk of code: 
<code>		app.activeDocument.resizeImage( target_width, target_height )</code>
It looks like we're doing something with 'app' here. 'app' actually refers to the program itself, i.e. Photoshop, and we're asking it to do something for us. I'm going to refer to 'app' as an 'object'. An 'object' is just a specific piece of a program that's been given a name so that you can talk to it and ask it to run commands. Generally each object will correspond to some part of the program that you're familiar with. For instance, as you'll see later, each layer in Photoshop has an object associated with it that you can use to manipulate the layer. In the line of code above, the Photoshop program itself is an object called 'app' and it has links within it to most of the other objects in the program, corresponding to all the controls and settings and information stored within Photoshop.

In JavaScript, dots between words serve a special function: they let you decide which part of something you want to deal with. We don't need to deal with the whole of 'app'; we just want to talk to the 'active document' object. That's to say, we want to deal with the Photoshop document that's on the screen right now and not any that may be in the background. And finally, we want to ask the active document to do something for us. We want it to run a 'resize image' command, just like you could do manually by clicking on the Image menu and then clicking on 'Image Size...' 

The way you resize an image from within a script is by making use of the 'resizeImage' command. That command is made available by the 'activeDocument' which in turn is part of 'app', the Photoshop program itself. Which is why we write this:
<code>		app.activeDocument.resizeImage( target_width, target_height )</code>

(I'll explain how you figure out that's where the 'resize image' command lives in a minute.) 
After the 'resizeImage' command there are some brackets. In most computer languages, round brackets like that are used to supply some information about the command you're triggering. (We refer to a command like this as a 'method' and triggering it as 'calling' it - so we're 'calling the resizeImage method' here). Normal users, when doing this manually, can just fill in the desired image size in the 'Image size...' dialog box. Within a script we have to supply that information by putting it between the brackets after a command. The 'resizeImage' command expects to be told the width and height you're asking for and that's what those two names inside the brackets refer to. But how do they convey that information?

In this case we've included something called 'target_width', then a comma, then something called 'target_height'. Those two names are 'variables'. If you remember your algebra from school, a variable is something you use in place of an actual value. If you knew, when you wrote this script, that you always wanted to resize every image to be 200 pixels wide and 300 high, you wouldn't need to use variables; you could write this:
<code>		app.activeDocument.resizeImage( 200, 300 )</code>
But I want to make my little script more flexible. Plus, I'm not necessarily sure what height I want to use until I do some calculation. I've decided that I want to make all images 250 pixels wide, but I don't know in advance what shape my image is. If it's square then I can set the height to 250 pixels: the same as the target width. But if it's tall and thin and I set both its height and width to 250 pixels I'll squash it. But let's just assume for a moment I want to see what that squashed image would look like. I could write this:
<code>            target_width  = 250</code>
<code>            target_height = 250</code>
<code>		app.activeDocument.resizeImage( target_width, target_height )</code>

I set the values of those two variables and then I use them to tell the resizeImage method what I want it to do. That's all there is to creating a variable: think of a name, use an equals sign, and then give it a value. The equals sign is effectively a command that sets the value of the variable to whatever comes after it.

But in this case we actually want to reduce the width to 250 pixels and then set the height to whatever value will keep the image from being distorted. In other words we want to scale down the height by the same fraction as the width, which means we need to do a little calculation. If you look in the script you can see the block of statements that include the resize command looks like this:
<code>		var height = docRef.height</code>
<code>		var ratio = target_width / width</code>
<code>		target_height = height * ratio</code>
<code>		docRef.resizeImage( target_width, target_height )	</code>

You can see we're setting the variable 'height' to... something. We're actually setting it to be the <i>current</i> height of the image. ('var' just means this is a very temporary variable and doesn't need to be available to the rest of the program.) Before we go on, I probably need to explain what 'docRef' refers to. If you look at the top of the script you can see this statement:
<code>	docRef = app.activeDocument</code>
'docRef' is a variable and it has been set to 'app.activeDocument'. That means we can actually use it as shorthand for 'app.activeDocument'. In other words, this line:
<code>		var height = docRef.height</code>
means the same thing as this line would:
<code>		var height = app.activeDocument.height</code>
but it's easier to type and saves the computer a little time.

Hopefully you can work out what 'app.activeDocument.height' means - at least in general terms. It means you're talking to the active document part of 'app' and you're asking it to run the 'height' command. This command doesn't require any information in brackets because all it does is fetch a piece of data. It fetches (as maybe you've guessed) the height of the image in the active document.

The next line sets the value of a variable called 'ratio' using the result of a calculation. The calculation involves dividing 'target_width' by 'width'. Both of those variables are set elsewhere in the script. 'width' is set with the following line:
<code>	var width = docRef.width</code>
As you can guess, what that does is fetch the current width of the image in the active document.
'target_width' is set right at the top like this:
<code>	target_width = 250</code>
which is fairly clear.
So 'ratio' is calculated by dividing the target width by the current width. For the sake of clarity, let's imagine the result of that calculation is 0.5. The next line would use that value of 0.5 to calculate the 'target_height', scaling it down by the same fraction as the width.
<code>		target_height = height * ratio</code>
But what would happen if the image is currently smaller than 250 pixels wide? Well, unless we did something about it, this script would actually scale the image size <i>up</i> so that its width reached 250 pixels. That would probably look bad so we put in a check to see that it doesn't happen. See if you can work out what's actually happening if I list out that whole chunk of code:
<code>	if(width > target_width){</code>
<code>		&nbsp;&nbsp;var height = docRef.height</code>
<code>		&nbsp;&nbsp;var ratio = target_width / width</code>
<code>		&nbsp;&nbsp;target_height = height * ratio</code>
<code>		&nbsp;&nbsp;docRef.resizeImage( target_width, target_height )	</code>
<code>    } </code>

The word 'if' is a command to the program to look at the question inside the round brackets and to work out if it's true. If it is true, then the program should run the statements between the curly braces. If the question isn't true then it should ignore those four lines.

The code inside the round brackets is this: <code>width > target_width</code>
It's asking whether 'width' is bigger than 'target_width'. In other words, it's checking whether the image needs scaling down (at least based on its width). The way we have things configured at this moment, the calculations and the resize image command only get run if the image is wider than 250 pixels.

So that's the image resized. Let's look at the next line:
<code>	docRef.resizeCanvas( target_width + h_border, target_height + v_border )</code>
Now we're asking the active document to call its 'resize canvas' command and we're passing the command some variables. You can see some plus signs inside the round brackets; the program adds up anything that needs adding up before it passes the results to the 'resize canvas' command. So the command will receive three numbers. Let's look at them in turn.
<code> target_width + h_border</code> takes the 'target_width' and adds 'h_border' to it. If we look at the top of the script we can see where the value of 'h_border' is set:
<code>	h_border = 10</code>
I want to create a horizontal border to the right of the image (as well as a vertical border below it) to leave room for a drop shadow. If I made the canvas the same size as the image, you wouldn't see that shadow. So I make the canvas width bigger than the image width by 10 pixels, the value of 'h_border'.

The second entry inside those round brackets does the same thing for height:
<code>target_height + v_border</code>
And finally there is the third entry which controls which part of the screen the canvas resize is centred on:
<code>AnchorPosition.TOPLEFT</code>
AnchorPosition is actually an object. I didn't create it; it's part of Photoshop. All it really does is return special values you can use elsewhere. By putting 'TOPLEFT' after the dot, we're asking the 'AnchorPosition' object to give us a value corresponding to that name. Now we don't actually care what that value is. You can think of it as a sort of private agreement between the 'resizeCanvas' command and the 'AnchorPosition' object. Whatever value the 'AnchorPosition' object supplies will be passed as the third value to the 'resizeCanvas' command. The creators of Photoshop wanted to give us the choice of centring any changes to the canvas on any of the four corners of the screen, or on the middle of one of the sides or on the centre. Because this is a program, they gave each of those possible options a number. But because humans are bad at remembering numbers, they created the 'AnchorPosition' object to take care of those numbers for us. If we want the canvas resize to be centred on the top left corner of the screen, then we just ask the 'AnchorPosition' object to provide the appropriate magic number to make that happen:
<code>AnchorPosition.TOPLEFT</code>
And, by the way, I want the canvas resize to be centred at the top left of the screen because (as you'll recall) I want to make a little bit of border around the right and bottom sides of the screen. So hopefully you can now work out what this line does:
<code>	docRef.resizeCanvas( target_width + h_border, target_height + v_border,)</code>

I'll explain one more block of commands and then I'll leave you to work out the rest. We'll consider this section:
<code>	while(docRef.artLayers.length > 2){</code>
<code>		&nbsp;&nbsp;docRef.artLayers[0].merge()</code>
<code>	}</code>

The 'while' command is like the 'if' command in a lot of ways. It has a question inside its round brackets, and the statements between its curly braces only get run if the answer to that question is true. But unlike the 'if' command, the 'while' command will run the statements it contains again and again. And each time it runs them it checks whether the answer to the question is still true. Hence the name: it runs 'while' the answer is true. Only when it's not true does it stop running the statements it contains and allow the program to go on to the next line.

So what is the question? 
<code>docRef.artLayers.length > 2</code>
You can probably work out that this expression appears to be checking if the length of the active document's 'artLayers' object is greater than 2. But what does that mean? Well, 'length' isn't the most helpful term. 'artLayers' is simply a collection of all the layers in this Photoshop document. Its 'length' is the number of layers it has. So if it has three or more layers, the question inside the brackets is true and the statement inside the curly braces will be run.
That statement looks like this:
<code>		docRef.artLayers[0].merge()</code>
It is doing something to the collection of layers in this Photoshop document. What it's actually doing is singling out one of those layers. That's what the square brackets are for. 'artLayers' is a collection of objects known as an 'array'. You single out one entry in an array by putting a number inside some square brackets: the number tells 'artLayers' which one of its layers you're interested in. I've supplied the number '0' because that's the top layer in the document. (Be aware: lots of computer languages start counting things at zero.) Thus we're asking for the top layer and then we're calling that layer's 'merge()' command. As you can probably guess, the merge command merges that layer with the one beneath it. After that has happened, the 'while' statement checks whether there are still more than two layers. If so, the top layer will again get merged with the one beneath it until there's only a single image layer plus a background layer. We want that to be the case because we're trying to end up with a nice flat image we can use on our website. (Note: if the document starts off with only two layers, the statement inside the 'while' command will never be run because the answer to the question inside the brackets will never be true.)

So hopefully that should help get you off the ground when using JavaScript to control Photoshop. If you feel like it, you could look at the other lines in my example script and take a guess at what they do. But what you'll need before you can get stuck in is lots of resources. First off, you need to know about all the objects in  Photoshop so that you can begin to work out which ones to call. They're all listed here:
<a href=""http://cssdk.host.adobe.com/sdk/1.5/docs/WebHelp/references/csawlib/com/adobe/photoshop/package-detail.html"">com.adobe.photoshop</a>
You also could do with some guidance on how to use those objects in a program. Here's a page with two reference guides on it:
<a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/photoshop/scripting.html"">Photoshop scripting guides</a>
It has lots of other guides too, but you want the first and third if you're writing scripts like mine.

You might also want to learn a bit more about JavaScript. One place you could start would be the W3 Schools page here:
<a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp"">W3 JavaScript</a>

You should also look at lots of example scripts. Photoshop comes with some. Go to the folder that the Photoshop program lives in and look for a folder called 'Scripting'. Dig around in there and you should find heaps of .jsx files. 

The web is full of JavaScript tutorials and it even has some that are intended for working with Photoshop, especially in places like the <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/photoshop/scripting.html"">Adobe forums</a>.

<a name=""running"">And finally</a>, when you've written your JavaScript script, you need to put it somewhere that Photoshop can find it. Go back to the folder containing the Photoshop program and look for a folder called 'Presets'. Within that, look for a folder called 'Scripts'. If you put a script in there, and then restart Photoshop, you'll see the name of your script under 'Scripts' on the 'File' menu. Just select the menu entry to make the script run.

Good luck and have fun.

Ages ago I mentioned a kerning game you can play in your web browser by going <a href=""http://type.method.ac/"">here</a>. If you fancy yourself as a bit of a typesetter then why not give it a go.

Then, when you're ready for a real aesthetic challenge go <a href=""http://shape.method.ac/"">here</a> and have a go at perfecting some font designs... as a game. 

I think I like the idea that there is room in the world for games where nothing explodes, no music plays and you're using some highly abstract ability - like your feeling for how the stroke on a capital 'Q' should curve - as your primary game skill. It's easy to imagine similarly abstract literary/artistic games based on your ability to choose between synonyms when honing a sonnet. Or correctly identifying complementary colours. In fact someone should make a game where you adjust the typeface, font size and text placement on a book cover for maximum beauty and impact. (Might be just the thing to help self-publishing authors avoid saddling their books with covers that scream 'self-published'.)","","","","","2011-11-14","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Theres an <a href=""http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/ff_bezos/all/1"">interesting piece</a> in this months Wired about the launch of the Kindle Fire and the future of Amazon. It begins as an editorial and turns into an interview with Jeff Bezos. A chunk of it concerns what you might call the positioning of the Fire and the devices that will come after it. As many have speculated, it seems that the Fire is not primarily intended as a general-purpose tablet; its designed more along the lines of its Kindle predecessors in that its a dedicated delivery-point for Amazon content. But unlike its predecessors, the Fire lets you consume not just books, but movies, music and apps - and it has an innovative full-service web browser built-in. It appears that Amazon would like to do to each of those new channels what they've already done to e-books.","Of course none of those capabilities really set the Fire apart from the iPad. The functionality is broadly similar; its the emphasis thats very different. Which may in fact be another of way of saying the iPad will beat the Fire on everything but price. 

Though, to be fair, theres no clear indication yet of what you might and might not be allowed to do via the Fires installed apps. Nevertheless the intention is clearly that this tablet is a conduit for content, not a tiny PC without a keyboard.

When I reached the part where Jeff Bezos expounded a little on his future vision, what struck me was how much it echoed the interest (obsession?) with internet portals that we saw in the late Nineties, in the heyday of the Dot Com Boom. Back then, when having a web presence of any sort was still a bit of a novelty for many firms, there was a vogue for 'thinking big' and approaching the web strategically'. The idea was that if you could get customers not just to visit your website, but to choose it as their home page, then you could be the gateway through with they reached the online world. You could be their tour guide, their chaperone and their personal shopper - and the world would need to come to you when it wanted access to your customers. 

This idea began (and to some extent ended) with AOL and CompuServe who offered the walled garden internet experience even before there was an internet. And the fact that those early, highly-successful experiments ultimately went into decline did nothing to dissuade others from following in their footsteps.

The closest anyone got was Google, who really did become the home page for a high percentage of the worlds web browsers. But they did so, in a sense, by resisting the venal temptations of portalhood. You could reach any and every part of the web via Google. You werent restricted to just Googles strategic business partners. And Googles doggedly minimalist interface remained the unobtrusive antithesis of other would-be portals. We allowed them to become our gateway to the web because they never abused the position or tried to profit from it in a way that made our lives more difficult. Most importantly, they offered a genuine functional advantage over their competitors.

But the dream of locking in your customers and owning the toll road (complete with shopping mall) by which they reached the web has never gone away. And to read Jeff Bezoss words it sounds as though he considers the time to be right for another attempt at the prize. The Fire will make it easy - perhaps ridiculously, even seductively easy to consume Amazons content in preference to anyone elses. The flip side might - and this is pure speculation on my part - turn out to be a lack of support for competing content. Will the Fire have a Kobo and an iBooks reader app? Will it have video players and music players which work with iTunes content? Will you be able to stream content from NetFlix? There are at least indications that the Fire will play music from outside sources - but then that ship has already sailed; they simply couldnt get away with denying users access to their established music libraries. Id be less sanguine about the non-Amazonian video playback options.

Even the Fires innovative web browser has some unique quirks which could, conceivably - and perhaps only subtly - corral customers, making it less likely that they stray too far from the fold. Amazon have given over a segment of their formidable computing power to act as a sort of proxy for Fire web browsers. When a Fire user fetches a web page, it is first fetched by Amazons mighty servers, assembled and compressed, and then passed to the Fires browser pre-digested. The system is called Silk and it will apparently make the loading of web pages much more responsive. But part of me wonders why we need that extra responsiveness. Given that this is a device intended for streaming large - or even huge - files, like music and movies, over an internet connection, isnt browsing the humble old web the least of its concerns? On the other hand, the idea that every byte and pixel of your web browsing experiences is routed via Amazons servers cannot help but feel slightly suspicious. Theyll know everything they want to know about your web behaviour and - if they so wished - theyd be in a position to make some of that behaviour easier and some of it a little more difficult.

To some extent Amazon are already well on their way to building a portal for e-books. The Kindle Store dominates the e-book realm and while existing Kindle devices will, grudgingly, do one or two other things, theyre really only happy when serving Amazon content. You can e-mail them non-Kindle books, but its not well-publicised and they wont WhisperSync between devices. To me, this seems like a preview of how Amazon versus non-Amazon content will work in the music, video and app arenas.

I also wonder whether Amazon need to be selling a TV too. If they want to stream video rather than let you download it (and that is clearly what the Fire is geared towards) then wont they need to give you a few more options for where you can watch? Will we spend a lot of money on content which only works on one tablet device?

Perhaps their pricing tariffs will provide the answer. Following on from what Ive been saying about Amazons fondness for selling below cost in order to get you hooked, Amazon Prime customers will apparently be given access to all sorts of free video content (12,000 and counting movies and TV shows). Maybe well feel happier about spending money on what might be a closed (and limited) platform if were renting access to a huge library rather than purchasing individual titles.

It might seem strange to offer this content to Amazon Prime customers, because Prime is all about paying a fixed fee for free high-speed delivery of packages - not on the face of it anything to do with video. But of course anyone who already has a Prime account will have a good incentive to buy a Fire. And anyone with a Fire who takes out Prime membership for the video library will have a strong incentive to buy more physical product. Its all about cross-selling and  multi-channel bundling: clever, but also just the sort of thing companies like Microsoft got in trouble for when it started to really deliver results.

Im not entirely sure why, but personally I cant see it working. Its a decade too late to lock anyone in when it comes to music and a couple of years too late to lock in a lot of video consumers. Not to detract from their hard work, but Amazon have been lucky with e-books in that they havent encountered any serious opponents yet. Their e-book format is dominant as are their e-reader devices, and both reinforce the others proprietary hold. But Amazon will encounter more than just fledgling start-ups and slow-witted dinosaurs when they make their push into other forms of content - and despite what this article says about Apple being a hardware company and Amazon being content-sellers* theres a lot of overlap when it comes to the Fire. There are over 40 million iPads out there already and restrictive though Apple often are, it looks like Amazon have an even more tightly controlled service in mind. Thats going to be a tough sell from a standing start with a product which is unlikely to wow anyone whos used an iPad. 


* Check out that chart where Wired invent a lot of nonsense reasons why Jeff is right. I mean, suggesting that Apple aren't 'cloud-centric' a couple of weeks after they wired up everything in their product line to iCloud is ridiculous.","","","","2011-11-14","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I'm not a grammar Nazi. I don't much care if you deploy the subjunctive cackhandedly or you use 'less' with count nouns. As far as I'm concerned, infinitives shall be split according to taste. And prepositions can bring up the rear if they wish. I'm aware of solid historical reasons why you might think 'you was there' is entirely grammatical. And I believe that if the majority of speakers think a word means something - even if older versions of the dictionary disagree - well, now it does mean that, because language is a democracy, whether we like it or not (and I happen to like it). But I do draw the line when it comes to professional writing - by which I mean the output of journalists, authors, editors, copywriters, spokespeople and those intending their words to reach large numbers of people. Unless you have a good reason - like you're writing in your local dialect or being edgy, urban and slangy - then I'd rather you stick to the rules they taught you in school. And in a pinch, if you can't remember anything else, if you get your homonyms muddled and switch randomly between ""their"", ""they're"" and ""there"", could you please, just for my sake, get your mind around ""its"" and ""it's""?","I don't know if it helps anyone, but I periodically wheel out this picture wot I did to help people get clear on which of the two possibilities you should plump for (click on the thumbnail for a slightly larger version). The gist is that you might want to picture the apostrophe in ""it's"" as a tiny ""i"" to remind you that it stands for ""it is"". And you might want to consider ""his"" and ""hers"" when you wonder whether ""its"" should really have an apostrophe in it because it's possessive.

Snap! I see that Emma just pointed you towards Google Images' new feature. Now I'm wondering if y'all have seen the fonts available at <a href=""http://www.google.com/webfonts#HomePlace:home"">Google Web Fonts</a>. 

You may or may not know that these days you can choose from thousands of fonts when you're putting a web page together. I mean, you could do that in the past, but unless your users also had those fonts installed they'd just end up seeing your site in one of the standard fonts we're all used to looking at on the web. But with <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_intro.asp"">HTML5</a> you can choose any old font you like and if your visitors don't have them installed your webpage can tell your browser how to secretly fetch them from somewhere like... Google Web Fonts.

But what surprised me was that you don't have to use those fonts in your web pages. I just downloaded a font to use in Illustrator. This one in fact: <span style=""font-family: 'Stardos Stencil', monospace; color: #065c95; font-size: 120%;"">here's a bit of text that will appear in Stardos Stencil font if you're using an up-to-date browser and let's face it, why wouldn't you be? They're free after all.</span> 

The fonts at Google Web Fonts are all open-source and free (like it says <a href=""http://www.google.com/webfonts#AboutPlace:about"">here</a>). So fill your boots. <a href=""http://www.google.com/webfonts#HomePlace:home"">link</a>","","","","","2011-11-17","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

So, there are 'enhanced' e-books available from the Kindle store that will only play on your shiny new Fire (which I'm assuming most of you don't have yet because of your lamentable lack of Americanness). There are lots of comics but I've found at least one e-book too with what I understand to be <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/10/the_dawning_of_the_new_kf8.html"">KF8</a>-style content. On the other hand, I'm still on the waiting list to be informed when Amazon releases software tools for publishers to help them create KF8 content. Which raises the question of how those publishers who had enhanced e-books ready for the Kindle Fire managed to do it. Presumably it's the <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/11/moving_to_the_latest_ebook_for.html"">two-tier system</a> I wrote about before. Certain, selected publishers must have been briefed and assisted by Amazon. Or is that an unwarranted assumption? Anyway, assuming it's true, I'm just wondering how they chose their pals. I mean, imagine Snowbooks had been chosen and we'd got Fire-only e-books ready for Christmas when many tens of thousands of people will unwrap the aforementioned tablet and go looking for some content. I mean, a leg-up like that could be worth a lot of money. We could stop buying Mr Kiplings mince-pies and switch to the Waitrose ones. Permanently.

I'm really tempted to switch to the passive voice the way politicians do because it turns out I was wrong about something (I know!). Let me just try it for a while: Today, Rob Jones, expressed his wish to 'clarify' his earlier remarks regarding Amazon's InDesign plug-in for creating Kindle e-books. Mr Jones said that it was 'regrettable' that certain assertions were made regarding user problems with the plug-in and that he was pleased to be able to announce that the bug in question is not part of its default operation. He thanked Amazon for their help in laying that portion of the public's concerns to rest.

Or in other words, when I found a nasty <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/11/indesign_kindle_plugin_bug.html"">bug in the plug-in</a>, I said that it occurred when using the default settings, but I was wrong. There is a bug, but it only bites if you manually set 'Footnotes location' to 'In place' - and that's NOT the default setting. That being the case, far fewer people than I imagined will be affected. I expect the main users of that setting will be: a) blunderers who select it without realising  b) blunderers who don't really know what any of the settings do anyway or c) honest-but-confused yeoman e-publishers who are frantically trying any and all settings as part of their desperate attempts to correct their yucky e-book layouts. I haven't decided which one of those camps I claim to be in yet. 

Anyway, thanks to the chaps and chapettes at Amazon for getting in touch, setting me straight, and for letting me know that they're working on the bug. <span style=""font-size: 80%; color: gray;"">And sorry again for always slagging you all off, like I sort of did *again* about an hour ago. <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/11/twotier_kf8_rollout.html"">link</a>. </span>","","","","","2011-11-24","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

There's a great Onion story from last year about how: <code>""According to a report released this week by the Center for Global Development, climate change, the popular mid-2000s issue that raised awareness of the fact that the earth's continuous rise in temperature will have catastrophic ecological effects, has apparently not been resolved, and may still be a problem.""</code> It's dark humour, but it skewers that attention-deficit problem the world tends to have when it comes to news stories. Have a read <a href=""http://www.theonion.com/articles/report-global-warming-issue-from-2-or-3-years-ago,18431/"">here</a>.

A much longer and less funny article in<a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/164497/capitalism-vs-climate""> The Nation</a> goes a bit further than suggesting we forgot about climate change. Despite the supporting science getting stronger and the evidence getting harder to miss, public opinion is heading in the opposite direction. What percentage of Americans believe that burning fossil fuels is changing the climate? Here are the poll results in three different years:
In 2007: 71% of Americans recognised man-made climate change was real.
In 2009: 51% believed it was real.
In 2011: 44% believe.
Wow. Likewise the media have been backing away from the issue. In 2001, American TV networks ran 147 stories on climate-change. By last year the number was down to 32. Celebrities buy fewer Priuses and Vanity Fair have long since abandoned their 'annual' Green issue. The article I'm referring to is probably TL;DR<span style=""color: red;"">*</span> for most of you, but it's <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/164497/capitalism-vs-climate"">here</a> and contains a fair bit of information that's, you know, important to the continued well-being of our species.

It's breathtaking, really. We need massive, globally-coordinated action to fix this nonsense and the only people who seem organised and vocal on this subject are the oil companies and a few right-wing billionaires claiming the whole thing's a hippy plot and that ten-thousand climate scientists are fudging their figures as a way of getting grants.

...or so says Charlie Stross. The argument runs like this: the big publishers don't want people nicking their books, so they insist on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management"">DRM</a> so they're locked down nice and tight. The biggest and best DRM platform is Kindle so that's where they head. But once Amazon have taken over the world, they will have considerable power over the big publishers and will squeeze their profits. <span style=""font-size: 80%; color: gray;"">(Or to misquote evil-Willow from that one episode of Buffy: ""In my world the publishers are in chains and we ride them like ponies."" Not that Charlie Stross said anything specifically about chains or ponies. I'm just colourfully illustrating his point.)</span> Anyway, have a  <a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2011/11/cutting-their-own-throats.html"">read of the blog post</a>. 

It's an interesting idea, no? Fear of naughty, light-fingered readers is pushing big publishers into the maw of the threat that they <em>should</em> be focussing on. 

It also makes me wonder what I'd do if I had a magic wand that gave me control over the world of publishing. Get ready for threadbare profit margins whatever happens, I suppose. I mean either Amazon are going to 'win', in which case margins will get thinner, or electronic self-publishing is going to combine with reader-led forums to bypass a lot of traditional publishing... and margins will get thinner. If I get to choose our method of execution, I think I'd probably prefer option 2.

If you want to be able to read an e-book, you pretty much need a device that connects to the internet. And many of those devices also *upload* information. For instance, Amazon's Whispersync technology lets head office know which page you're up to in your e-book so that when you switch to another device, that gadget can jump to the right page. It's a darned handy feature. And that sort of functionality gives Amazon, and potentially publishers too, access to all sorts of new info. You can tell when a reader abandons a book, for instance. Imagine a graph that shows that, on average, people who didn't finish a particular techno-thriller stopped reading in chapter 14. That's the chapter where our hero visits his grandmother to get her advice. Boring! But why not put out a 'revised edition' where instead of receiving homilies over camomile tea the hero instead arrives to find grandma rigged with explosives by the CIA splinter cell he's been closing in on?

That scenario may be horrifying to many publishers (not the thing with the grandmother - that's just good, clean fun - the bit about issuing revised editions based on surveillance). But it seems to me that as this new information becomes available to us we're going to need some sort of rule for how to use it. If Google, Facebook and Amazon ever teamed up they'd know an unbelievable amount about an unbelievable number of people.","Imagine a scenario even more unpalatable than tweaking books by monitoring reading habits. Image you get an e-mail from Amazon which reads, ""Dear Jane, is the new baby keeping you up at night? We noticed that you'd been buying Calpol and reading your P.D. James at 2am. Why not download these MP3 lullabies? Your friend Carol (who you recently sent a silk scarf to) gave them five stars in her review. Unfortunately she hated the scarf (one star in her review) but she loves perfume, like this gift pack of her favourite scent currently on special offer. Oh and by the way, there's an 85% chance she's pregnant again and we're having a sale on maternity wear!""

If they wanted to, Amazon could work out *all sorts* of things about you. And if you've ever used GMail and looked at the way adverts in the right-hand sidebar attempt to guess what medical ailment, psychiatric disorder or criminal offence you're currently grappling with, you'll have had a taste of what a world of overly-personalised marketing could feel like.

I don't know what the solution is, but marketing really needs a mantra, a rule of thumb or some set of guidelines to help marketeers decide when they've overstepped the mark. Maybe something along the lines of ""Imagine that your company was a person. Never say anything to one of your customers that:
* was revealing enough to embarrass them in front of their mother
* was knowledgeable enough to make their partner suspicious they were having an affair
* was personal enough to  make them change practices if their doctor said the same thing
* was one-sided enough to count as evidence if you were accused of stalking them
* that contains information they thought no one knew but themselves

The Uncanny Valley, by the way, is a term used by animators and robot-builders. It refers to the way that bad copies of people are simply unconvincing, but really good copies can be positively unnerving. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley"">here</a> for Wikipedia's explanation. It's something to bear in mind as we get far too good at mining our marketing data and pretending to be our customers' best friend.","","","","2011-12-01","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

Two or three things randomly collected together:

* The Amazon Fire is out and has been thoroughly reviewed. Andy Ihnatko always does a good job on these matters and his review is chatty but thorough. (The Fire is a lot more open than I predicted. You can indeed load the Hulu+ and NetFlix apps on it, plus other apps to let you play content not natively supported. It also offers the 'Mantano' app that will let you read EPUBs. Good news if you want a tablet for half the price of an iPad - and you're not planning to use it as a laptop replacement.) <a href=""http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/8816567-452/review-kindle-fire-is-no-ipad-killer-but-it-is-a-killer-device.html"">review</a>.

* I know everyone in Britain has had something to say about Jeremy Clarkson's recent <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15977813"">remarks</a> and the furore they've caused but I wanted to add my 2d's worth. First off, my favourite quote about the whole thing was from the brilliant Ben Goldacre who said, ""<code>Complaining about Clarkson expressing an offensive view is like complaining that the wheels just fell off your clown taxi.</code>"" (<a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/bengoldacre/status/142005420922372096"">source</a>). Despite my politics being at the other end of the spectrum from Clarkson, his comments didn't bother me at all - in fact I think he's an appalling, but extremely funny man. But I experienced severe embarrassment listening to union leaders and other left-wing stalwarts calling for punishment, legal suits, sacking, etc; Left vs Right is not supposed to be two random teams scrapping. It's supposed to be about principles. The left is supposed to remember that free speech is vital to their view of the world and that the only reason that strikes aren't banned by the state is because enough people stood up for the right of union members to express their views and grievances in the form of protest. You don't get to call a strike and then demand someone else be dragged into court for making a joke you don't like. Locking people up for inappropriate humour is the sort of thing I'd hope unions campaigned against not for.

Not everyone *gets* Bruce Sterling. I had a very quick chat to him when I was in Texas early in the year and one could be forgiven for thinking that he was drunk at 10am. Not that he wasn't friendly and extremely interesting, but there's something about his run-on slightly-whiney monologues that makes you think he's just rambling. But if you continue to pay attention you generally hear something pretty amazing pretty soon. And you start to wonder if maybe he rants on like that because he's fairly used to people not being able to follow the trajectory of his remarks - perhaps on purpose in some cases. Anyway, here's Mr. Sterling unspooling another of his golden threads of unpunctuated insight and disaffection. I recommend watching it if you're at all able to dial yourself in to the eccentricity of his delivery. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC6yylIwyKg"">link</a>.

I'm a long way off wishing all my books were electronic. And it depends on the type of book as to where my preferences lie. I've said before that the typesetting and presentation of most e-books is rubbish - not to mention the e-readers, the software and the formats (e.g. EPUB, Mobi) being barely up to the task. E-books are at their shaky best when the source material has no footnotes or images or tables or non-standard fonts or unusual layouts. Nevertheless, I'm reading more and more books electronically. And when I switch back to paper I'm starting to notice a few failings by comparison:
* Reading in bed the other night I actually caught myself thinking, ""I'll put the light out now and just read one more chapter."" Then I remembered I was reading on paper not on my iPad and paper needs a separate light source.
* I've got pretty used to asking a book to define a word like 'metonym' or look up a term like 'Hanseatic League'.
* It's not ideal, but every now and again I want to read a bit more of the book I was reading at home while I'm on a train... and all I have with me is my phone. 
* If I'm looking to quote something I read, I like to be able to search a book
* I'm on a trip and I get two pages into reading my book and realise I want to be reading something else. I like to be able to either dip into one of the other fifteen books I've got on the go (not novels, of course. more likely to be things like Gleick's The Information where you can read a chapter at a time). Or I'll nip online and buy something new.

That's not to say that paper books don't retain a lot of advantages - and they're put together with much more care too - but it's got to the stage where I feel they also have their drawbacks.","","","","","2011-12-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

I'm about to do you such a favour. I'm going to tell you how to make fabulous coffee. It takes about two minutes.

First off, this is <em>my</em> definition of great coffee and I'm <u>not</u> a proper coffee snob. For a start, my favourite kind of coffee is a latte - and probably not the correct definition of a latte either - more like what Starbucks might make for you on a good day. I'm talking about something that's half hot milk but which has a really rich and smooth coffee taste. In the last couple of weeks I've had some of the best cups of coffee of my life and I made them all myself. And best of all, you can almost certainly improve on what I'm doing here. (But note, you will need to spend twenty quid - or the equivalent in foreign money)","First of all, you're going to need to buy an AeroPress. Amazon UK have someone <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Aerobie-AeroPress-80R08-Coffee-Maker/dp/B000GXZ2GS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1323337152&sr=8-1"">here</a> who'll send you one for &pound;21 plus p&p. They're basically a tube with a filter at the bottom and a plunger at the top. In other words, they're the plastic offspring of a cafeti&egrave;re (= french press) and a drip coffee maker. 

Here's what you do to make a large mug of coffee the way I like it:
1. Heat up some water to near boiling. If you're using a kettle, you're going to want to turn it off about 20 seconds before it shuts itself off. Coffee tastes better made with not-quite-boiling water (whereas tea demands boiling water). Or you could use a drip coffee maker with no coffee, just water, in it. Or you could let the kettle boil but add a little bit of cold water to the coffee before tipping in the boiling water from the kettle. Or boil the water and then wait a couple of minutes. Lots of options. While the water's heating do step 2.
2. Put a cup of milk in the microwave and give it a minute on full power. While it's heating, continue with step 3.
3. Put a filter in your AeroPress and screw the bottom on. Put in four level scoops of ground coffee. I go for 'espresso' coffee, ideally something fairtrade because that way the coffee has better tasting karma in it. Put it on top of a large mug. I use a double-walled metal mug because then the coffee stays hot for about 20 mins.
<img alt=""TravelMug.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/TravelMug.jpg"" width=""121"" height=""207"" />
4. Tip not-quite-boiling water onto the coffee and stir for ten seconds.
5. Wet the plunger and push the coffee out of the AeroPress and into the mug. Only use gentle pressure. If you've stirred well enough this will take no more than 30 seconds. Push the plunger down until it scrunches the coffee grounds, which makes it easier to...
6. Eject the spent fuel pellet. Rinse out the AeroPress and leave to dry. (As you'll see, There's No Mess With An AeroPress (=my own cheesy slogan, not theirs). Ejecting the fuel pellets is almost as much fun as drinking the coffee.)
7. Add the hot milk to the coffee in the large mug. Rinse the cup you heated the milk in and leave to dry.
8. Elapsed time around 2 mins. Now enjoy your tasty coffee-drink!
9. Repeat aloud: ""I've said 'yes' to flavour."" Optional: punch air in triumph.","","","","2011-12-08","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

I'm not ashamed to admit that I don't always understand what today's kids are on about. Pop music, moisturiser for men, Post-It notes: it often takes me a while to get on board with the latest trends. And much as I hate to hear people my age drone on about 'not seeing the point' of something, I just couldn't quite get my head around Twitter. I listened to a couple of lazy comedians making fun of people who tweet about making a sandwich or going to the shops and I probably did think, ""those scruffy hippies with their Twitter-blogging should just get a haircut and a proper job.""

But I decided to give it a try. I mean, Velcro turned out to be pretty useful, so I shouldn't be such a Luddite about new things. And for a while I followed a few celebs (NB: followed on Twitter, not in real life, in a disguise). And it made the cool, funny ones seem cooler and funnier and the dyslexic ones seem more dyslexic. But then from time to time I'd read a retweet of something cool from a non-celeb and add that person to the list of my followees (or whatever the word would be).","I'm a nerdy person, so my twitter feed has gradually filled up with talk of economics, hacking, politics, science and technology. I get to follow conversations between alpha-nerds about funny or fascinating things. I get lots of links to interesting articles and papers or news stories. And each new person I follow generally leads me to another new person who's doing something cool. Or I cull them from the list once I realise they're not really on my wavelength.

So after a while I went from thinking Twitter was pointless, to thinking it was a great way of getting tips and heads-ups about things that interest me from people I'd never bump into in 'real life'. I also noticed that I'd get switched on to something big happening in the news much much faster via Twitter than if I waited for a real-world human to say, ""Did you see the news about the Japanese earthquake?""

Twitter really comes into its own when things are happening fast in the world. I tended to knew more at any given moment about the Fukushima reactor overheating than you could learn from the TV or a newspaper (even an online one). Someone I trusted would tweet about how you should be following this one guy who's a nuclear scientist who's onsite, someone else would say 'no, he's getting his stuff from this guy', and in minutes you'd have found a great source for instant updates that was already vetted by a dozen smart people you knew were usually right about whom to trust.

But what's really made me understand Twitter is following the Occupy protests in Wall Street, San Francisco, Portland, DC and elsewhere. I hear about how a march is going (complete with heaps of uploaded photos) and then about the police closing in. I can follow along via tweets, many of which include links to photos or videos. And it's all pretty much in real time. (Even following the timeline after the event feels extremely immediate.) I can read what the crowd is chanting seconds after it happens. And see a blurry cameraphone photo of a cop dragging someone away before they're even in the van. I'm several thousand miles away and I feel involved.

I even started to wonder if this was voyeuristic and unhealthy. Am I just getting vicarious thrills from online-stalking a bunch of activists while staying safe in my cosy home? But then I started to realise that this is what news aspires to. This is the point of it. You're supposed to feel connected to what's happening, particularly if it's something you care about. Pair it with more deliberative, after-the-event reflections and you've really got an interesting perspective on events.

And it's made a real difference to how I then view the story in the newspaper the next day as it tells me what happened. If I've watched eight cameraphone videos of riot police hitting unarmed civilians and the paper says the protesters were to blame for the trouble, I know that's not 100% true. Thirty people with cameraphones can document something in real time in a way that would be exceedingly difficult to fake. Cast your mind back to <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/11/"">this highly misleading photo</a> that all the papers carried and ask yourself whether a protester with a secondhand iPhone, live-streaming an event, could feasibly distort the truth as much. Something happens; they film it; they hit upload: elapsed time 30 seconds. Maybe in the future, with enough funding, there'd be time to 'doctor' that sort of footage, or mock it up in an editing suite, but right now it feels like the unvarnished and immediate truth. Which is a pretty amazing thing to get from what's basically an internet version of a text message. 

A good set of Twitterers to follow = recommended.","","","","2011-12-08","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

This may not interest you, being more revolutionary than literary, but it amused me. I don't know if the papers will pick it up but there was apparently considerable entertainment to be had last night in New York City. The TV show, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit"">Law and Order</a>, decided to do an episode that featured the Occupy Wall Street camp which until recently used to reside in Zuccotti Park until the NYPD <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15732661"">raided</a> it and threw the whole thing into dumpsters. So the TV company built a replica in a different Manhattan park... complete with <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/11/the_peoples_library.html"">People's Library</a>, food and medic tents. I happened to be following along on Twitter when the protesters found out that their camp had been resurrected... as a film set - not far from where the real thing used to stand. ""So all we needed to do was create a fake film company, apply for a permit, and we could have stayed?"" asked one protester.

Then someone realised, well, if they've gone to the trouble of rebuilding our old home, maybe we should move in. So the real Occupy protesters headed over to see the fake camp. And finding it more or less deserted, they made themselves comfortable and had a look around. Apparently the food in the food tent was healthier than the real version, and the handmade signs were a little bit too 'art school', but the books in the library were about right. The Twitter hashtags for the night became #moccupy and #fauxcotti.  And just as the surreality of the situation was really sinking in, the police turned up to clear them out - raising the mind-boggling question of whether the NYPD were there to <em>protect</em> an exact replica of what the same police officers had recently <em>destroyed</em> because only exact copies of the camp could be tolerated, not the real thing.  A few wags claimed to be unsure about whether the cops on the film set of a TV cop show were TV cops or real life cops, but the cops (=real) didn't seem to be in the mood for games.","And once the police had displaced the protesters, there was even more surrealism on display, because the police were now effectively occupying the fake camp. Cheeky protesters demanded to know what the new occupiers' demands were and chanted, ""Whose fake camp? Our fake camp!""

The final hilarity of the evening was when the police assisted the TV people in dismantling their film set and couldn't tell which were real NYPD barricades and which belonged to the movie people. 

I do hope the news media pick this story up because a) it's fun and b) it boggles the mind thinking about the NYPD being faced with two identical protest camps, one which they bulldozed and the other which they moved into and protected.

Is it patronising to call James Bridle a 'Snowbooks alumni'? Perhaps I should simply say that he was responsible for a number of our books in years gone by before he headed off to do all sorts of new and interesting things. One of which I was finding highly entertaining the other day (until my internet connection refused to fetch the second half of it). James gave a keynote talk at Web Directions South in Sydney about something he had, in a slightly tongue in cheek way, named 'the new aesthetic'. As I say, I've only managed to get my hands on the first twenty minutes of the talk but it's a very interesting exploration of the way that certain artistic sensibilities are being influenced by the 'digital' realm. The web gives us eyes and ears on the world, it becomes part of our sensory apparatus, so perhaps it's no surprise that it also changes how we perceive reality and gives artists opportunities to mix and blend features of the digital with aspects of reality. If that sounds too abstract (probably because I'm failing to explain it well) let me give you a tiny example from James's talk: a square of turf cut out of a public park by the artist <a href=""http://helmutsmits.nl/public-spaces/dead-pixel-in-google-earth"">Helmut Smits</a> which is of the correct size so as to appear like a dead pixel on your monitor when you view the park on Google Earth.

Back when Snowbooks first began, we realised something a little bit counter-intuitive: it was far more important to sell our books to retailers than to sell them to readers. If we could get Waterstones to put one of our titles on a shelf at the front of each store then the readers would see it and many would take an interest - we didn't need to reach out to readers directly (which was good news because we struggled to find a way to do that). Now I'll admit that when a book gets *really* famous - or when the plan is for it to *become* really famous - then a different approach is required. But we've never been in a financial position to say, ""We'll have a big launch, then let's put a couple of hundred thousand quid into bus stop and tube ads, and then follow up with some TV spots."" When your marketing budget is measured in hundreds not thousands of pounds - and when you can't afford to have nine flops because the tenth will pay it all back - you have to put your money and effort into whatever comes closest to guaranteeing results. And the only affordable way we had of getting the attention of large numbers of readers - that's to say, not a couple of hundred, but many thousands - was to get a good placement in store in a major chain.

Annoyingly the major chains are now dwindling. Borders is gone and WHSmiths on the high street looks like a badly-managed stockroom - at least the ones near me do. You'd have to set fire to a book to have it stand out. WHSmiths Travel have great locations for catching the reader's eye, but we've found their internal processes to be so disastrous that there's no commercial point doing business with them. And of course the independents are not a single bloc with which one can arrange a promotion (much in the same way that cats are not a single organisation). Favourable reviews in the major press seem to reap rewards for some publishers and some titles, but they have had little benefit for us and many we have spoken to. So what does that leave when it comes to catching the attention of readers?","I think we're all gradually having to look beyond the traditional 'broadcast' approach to marketing - you know, that whole mass-market, one-to-many, megaphone of marketing that really took off in the 1950s and peaked sometime late in the last century. The old approach assumes that your target audience all congregate somewhere or pay attention to something, and that 'something' or 'somewhere' is how you reach them. You put an ad in their favourite magazine or a commercial before their favourite film. In effect, you try to piggy-back on something they already care about. That whole approach reaches its most blatant and undesirable pinnacle in online pop-up ads which literally insert themselves between the reader and the article they are trying to read. I'm not intending to imply that 'broadcast' marketing must be annoying, I'm simply saying that pop-ups demonstrate the idea most clearly: go where your target audience are and then try to attract their attention.

So where do readers congregate, as book chains wane? I think increasingly readers will talk to each other about books, and naturally many of them will do that online. 

Which raises another point about 'broadcast' marketing: it assumes you can buy 'air time' or 'ad space' where your consumers congregate. That's not always the case - and it certainly won't be in the future when we're trying to join in a conversation that a community is already having.

I can see publishers needing to get very much better at supporting reader communities. And note, I don't mean co-opting them or 'farming' them (which is to say attempting to grow them artificially for commercial reasons); I mean supporting real, spontaneous reader communities in such a transparent and guileless way that readers don't smell a rat.

We've all seen what it looks like when a big company tries to get reader debate going - but on the company's terms, on the company's website, surrounded by company ads and special offers, in order to 'discuss' (and ideally praise) the company's own books, all mediated by the company's administrators. I think what we've seen much less of is publishers turning up to pre-existing communities the way you'd turn up to a neighbourhood party, bringing the equivalent of homemade potato salad and a couple of bottles of wine.

Some time soon I think publishers will need to gear up to supporting reader communities with no thought of managing them or unduly influencing them. We will need to supply information, encourage - but not direct - discussion and even be prepared to listen rather than speak. The publishing industry has many decades of talking behind it, but I can't help feel it is a novice when it comes to listening. We decide what is published and then we tell you why you should read it. There will be room in the future for publishers who ask readers what they would like more of and then go away to find it for them. Then they return and ask how well they have done. I think it will require a humility that I don't currently associate with publishing and a diluting - or at least a compromising of - editorial control. If you like you could see it as a form of egalitarianism in which the publisher no longer address the readership as the expert or the leader. 

I don't see that humility, that ceding of control and that spirit of equality with the reader coming easily to our industry. And while I think it's necessary, I don't think it will save us. But I think it will allow a number of us to survive well into a new era, at which point other possible metamorphoses will have hopefully occurred to us so that we can hop onto the next stepping stone that the evolving world of books offers us.","","","","2011-12-12","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Sadly, that title isn't as much fun as it sounds. And it's not a writing or publishing term so you might want to sit this post out if you're not in the mood for gloom-laden current affairs talk.

Ann Pettifor is someone I <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/01/"">mentioned</a> on the blog in 2008. She's an economist and back in 2006 she wrote a book about how the boom in the global financial system would soon end to be followed by a huge debt crisis. Not only was she right about the outcome, she was right about the reasons for it. 

The bad news is that she's now saying things are about to get worse.","As the more economics-y of you may accept, this business of sovereign debt, where politicians wail about how much the U.K. or the U.S. government has borrowed, is a bit of a red herring. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_debt"">Sovereign debt</a> didn't cause the current crisis and a number of countries currently suffering depressed economies have lower debt levels than they did in the past (in % of GDP terms). Take a look at the graph below (from Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman's NYTimes <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/british-debt-history/"">column</a>) showing British public debt. Borrowing is well within historical parameters.
<img alt=""UKDebtvsGDP.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/UKDebtvsGDP.jpg"" width=""480"" height=""277"" />

With the exception of Greece, the same is true of most other countries embroiled in the financial crisis. And given that public debt isn't causing the crisis, introducing severe austerity measures to drive it down seems at best a low priority and at worst a sure-fire way of sabotaging economic recovery. It's never made any sense to me, a non-economist, how spending less and sacking people could boost the economy out of recession, and a good many mainstream economists agree (<a href=""http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/the-myth-of-profligate-euro-zone-countries"">link</a>). Austerity measures make the the recession worse and they also do not address what got us into this mess.

The real danger, as Ann Pettifor <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ann-pettifor/greek-debt-crisis_b_977733.html"">will tell you</a>, was never public borrowing, but speculation by under-regulated banks, the worst examples of which are in the City of London. But despite the recent financial catastrophe, we are still a long way from any serious reform of the banking sector. Only last week, the Prime Minister risked upsetting the rest of Europe and many of his fellow citizens by vetoing an EU-wide treaty because he felt he needed to protect the City from regulation. Shouldn't we all be glad that <em>someone</em> wants to regulate the banks, even if the EU proposals were 90% about protecting banks from their own bad decisions and only 10% about regulating them. But the P.M. has characterised the EU's suggestion of regulation as an attack on the City. 

Even if he had a point, and regulation threatened the City's viability, surely there are some big question marks over whether we want financial services to be the sector Britain relies on for growth. Firstly, they've cost us more money than they've made and secondly they do a very mediocre job of providing employment and tax revenue compared to our old mainstay: manufacturing. See <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/dec/12/britain-ruled-by-banks?newsfeed=true"">here</a> for more on that topic. I wonder how many Brits, if forced to choose, would prefer a vibrant manufacturing sector over a vibrant investment banking sector. My guess would be nearly everyone.

But to get back to Ann Pettifor's warnings: we haven't done anything to curb the speculative excesses of the banks that triggered this recession and they're still playing Russian roulette on a huge scale. Which might not be so bad if, like Iceland, we were prepared to let them fail and to spend our time rescuing the economy and not the bankers (Iceland's banker-jailing, economy-saving miracle recovery is described <a href=""http://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/Key-lesson-Iceland-crisis-let-afp-2835915223.html?x=0"">here</a>). But it's clear looking at the EU, at U.S. treasury policy and at the P.M.'s veto that the banks are still one of the highest priority stakeholders that governments want to please - if not <em>the</em> highest. 

Ann Pettifor even shares a colleague's theory about which domino falling may be the start of the next cascade of failures: a firm called M F Global. She links to a piece by Christopher Elias at Thomson-Reuters (<a href=""http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Securities/Insight/2011/12_-_December/MF_Global_and_the_great_Wall_St_re-hypothecation_scandal/"">link</a>) detailing how M F Global's use of something called 'hyper-hypothecation' allowed it to go spectacularly bankrupt in a way that many others may soon emulate. The problem is that M F Global went bust in the same way that AIG and Lehman's did back in 2008. The problems have not been fixed and the loopholes are still being gleefully and recklessly exploited. 

I do hope Ms. Pettifor (and Christopher Elias and the other doomsayers) are wrong about all this, but that's what I said last time... and they were right. (Ms. Pettifor also has much to say on the subject of CDSs, which appear to be bets you can make that will pay out if you find a way to crash part of the financial markets. They also do not sound like something you want vast amounts of in circulation.)

Hyper-hypothecation, by the way, is discussed <a href=""http://www.zerohedge.com/news/why-uk-trail-mf-global-collapse-may-have-apocalyptic-consequences-eurozone-canadian-banks-jeffe"">here</a>. It refers to out-of-control re-hypothecation, which is when a firm uses their client's money as collaterial on the firm's own risky investments. It's legal, but it certainly doesn't sound safe. And worse, by using client's money to secure the firm's investments, a brokerage can act like a bank - but not one that's <em>regulated</em> like a bank. The UK rules - or rather lack of rules - that allow this sort of thing is the reason why Lehman's and AIG and now M F Global did business here... and we've done nothing to rein any of it in.

One of the reasons so much trading occurs in the City and not on Wall Street is that Wall Street, in certain important ways, has tighter regulations. The 're-hypothecation' rules are much tighter in the U.S. which makes it harder to run an entire 'shadow banking' sector the way you can if you set up an office in the City. And it's true that more regulation for the City might drive away business just as the P.M. fears. But the businesses it would drive away are those engaging in exactly the same hand-grenade-juggling act that blew up great chunks of the global economy in 2008.

Even if you don't see another financial collapse in our immediate future, there's no getting away from two points:
1) if we wanted to we could separate the aspects of banks that we need on a day to day basis (i.e. the high-street, 'retail' banks) from the 'casino' banks who make money from high-risk speculation. We could also limit the kinds of end-of-the-world bets the casino banks were allowed to make. And then, when they failed, we could watch them go while heaving a sigh of relief.
2) so long as politicians bend over backwards to give the banks what they want, they're not bending over backwards to help ordinary voters. The banks aren't the same thing as the economy; we know this because a rescue of the banks has plunged the rest of the country into recession. We need to stop politicians conflating the two and getting away with it. They're supposed to look out for the people who vote not the people who donate.

<code>update:</code> some signs of movement toward the separation of 'casino' and 'retail' banks as the Chancellor insists he'll push ahead with a plan to have banks 'ringfence' the capital of their retail operations. It won't go all that far and it won't happen fully until 2019 and it does nothing to address the re-hypothecation or CDS problems mentioned here, but it's certainly better than nothing. (an overview is available <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/dec/18/cable-accepts-vickers-banking-reform"">here</a>)

A nice quote from <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/dec/18/cable-accepts-vickers-banking-reform"">that article</a> by an ex-investment banker: ""<code>Of course, in the real world, one would expect the views of those responsible for the mess prompting the reform to be heavily discounted by those responsible for executing the reform. But politics and the real world have little in common. Since the political class has a lamentable lack of understanding of how finance actually works, it is forced to rely on advice from roughly the same crew that sank the ship in the first place, in determining how the ship should be remodelled.</code>""","","","","2011-12-13","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

So what do we think about this <em>b&ecirc;te du jour</em> of Amazon offering shoppers money to do their browsing in bookshops but their spending online? There was a New York Times editorial (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/opinion/amazons-jungle-logic.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all"">here</a>) about how it was wrong because independent bookshops are cuddly and wonderful like baby owls. And there was this counter-argument (<a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/12/independent_bookstores_vs_amazon_buying_books_online_is_better_for_authors_better_for_the_economy_and_better_for_you_.html"">here</a>) saying that Amazon were stinkers for a completely different set of reasons but in many ways independent bookstores were much bigger stinkers. I'm not sure that latter article, though rationally presented, is going to do much more than cause hysteria.

I remember in the UK, Dixons trying something similar, where they suggested you do your browsing in John Lewis (though they employed a flurry of nudging and winking in place of naming them) but do your purchasing with Dixons. I seem to recall <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2009/10/more_marketing.html"">I was agin' it</a> and powerfully so in that case because I really do think John Lewis are as cuddly as a baby owl (being owned by their employees and being principled to a preposterously high standard). Indie bookshops I'm less sure about. I like them and I don't want Amazon snapping them up like some sort of evil anteater on the rampage. But I do take the writer from Slate's point that if there's anything that Amazon does well it's to get people reading more books for less money. 

OK, I think I'm now ready to render a verdict on this whole business, and it is: 'dunno'. I think I'll have to wave this particular scandal through without laying a glove on it because I'm not sure enough of my own views. But surely that won't stop you commenting types, will it?

<code>update:</code> I forgot to make it clear (in case you don't read the articles I've linked to) that the Amazon offer <u>excluded books</u> which is an important point. So this particular situation is about competing with bookstores on non-book sales (e.g. CDs) - although I think most people have seen it as symbolic or symptomatic of a larger battle and of various similar tactics.","","","","","2011-12-14","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Excellent.

Bureaucracy is a funny old thing. Under UK law, e-books attract standard-rate VAT because they are text ""supplied by electronic transmission"" (<a href=""http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&id=HMCE_CL_000102&propertyType=document#P28_1297"">source</a>). And of course paper books are 'zero-rated' for VAT. What that means is that someone has to pay an extra 20% on top of the nominal price of an e-book but not a paper book. Either the retailer or publisher need to swallow that charge or, more likely, the customer does. 

It's a peculiar setup because increasingly we use e-books and paper books interchangeably. In many (I would suggest most) publishing companies, the e-book is brought into being using the exact same files used to create the paper version, with a few extra tweaks and adjustments thrown in. So the chances are that the content, at least in novels and other all-text formats, is identical to the paper version right down to the last comma. And especially on e-ink screens, the reading experience can be very close to that of a paper book. I think in the reader's mind an e-book is a kind of book, whereas under tax regulations one is printed and bound material, the other is something quite different: text delivered electronically. In reality, the main differences are in the means of production and the method of delivery. Given that VAT is a consumer-oriented tax, it's strange that the nature of the product and the benefit to the consumer end up being more or less irrelevant compared with the supply chain details of how it arrived in the consumer's hands.","It's also strange that many eco-friendly products attract the reduced VAT rate (=5%) e.g. items like solar panels and wind turbines. And yet when it comes to books, chopping down trees is zero-rated while the low-impact electronic version is taxed at the full rate. 

A friend who deals with VAT law for a living tells me that this is not because of any careful thought; it is simply a consequence of old definitions which have unexpected modern consequences, but which no one wants to change because re-wording or re-drawing VAT regulations is a huge can of worms that no one wants to open.

Even so, the logical inconsistency of the current regime makes you start to wonder if there are ways for publishers themselves to redefine an e-book to bring it into line with its paper equivalent. What if e-books were supplied as printable files? If a reader paid to download a printable file and chose not to print it, but instead read it on-screen, could it be priced as printed material? No? What if you did choose to print it and attach a binding? Would it now be zero-rated? Or what about printing the cheapest, flimsiest paperbacks you ever saw and offering a free e-book to accompany each one sold. The paperback is made available for collection, should you wish to come and pick it up, but most would choose not to. (And if they were printed mainly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_on_demand"">P.O.D</a>. most of the cost of the paper version could be avoided by the publisher.)

And of course if you have enough money, all you do is supply your e-books from some offshore VAT island like Jersey. Which means that VAT has the effect of penalising the environmentally-friendly e-books of small publishers as compared with higher-impact paper or the sales of larger organisations. That's surely not what any EU politician would have chosen. But that's the situation and those are the incentives until someone either redefines or successfully circumvents the current rules.

<img src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/SnowBullet.gif""/> Tim linked to <a href=""http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/49874-is-amazon-pushing-publishers-to-brink-on-terms-co-op-.html"">this article</a> on Publishers* Weekly about how Amazon might be tightening the screws on publishers. However the bit I liked best was Tim's own comment (<a href=""https://plus.google.com/107033731246200681024/posts/RMiM5AuQ7rm"">here</a>) about a bit of recent publishing history: <code>""I've seen for a long time where Amazon is headed, towards a Walmart-like status where it can dictate whatever terms it likes to the publishing industry. And that was why I was amazed at the train-wreck of short-term thinking that led to the Google Books lawsuit by the Association of American Publishers and the Author's Guild. Faced with the threat of a future monopoly by a ruthless competitor as pbooks transition to ebooks, a potential white knight arrives on the scene...and the publishers promptly sue the white knight! And as a result, though no one is saying it out loud, Google has quietly de-prioritized its efforts and abandoned the publishers to their fate.""</code> Ha ha. We're such idiots.
<img src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/SnowBullet.gif""/> Mr Tim also linked to an article in the Observer about four startups taking innovative approaches to publishing. <a href=""http://link"">link</a>.
<img src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/SnowBullet.gif""/> And on a non-publishing note, I wanted to share a quote from <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/laurie-penny-people-power-isnt-just-a-fad-for-a-magazine-cover-6279127.html"">an article</a> in The Independent on the subject of the recent Climate Change talks in Durban. This is Laurie Penny's summary of the outcome from Durban: <code>""With a maximum of five years to go before carbon emissions at current rates make climate disaster a certainty, governments ask those already under water to give them 10 years to think about it.""</code>
<img src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/SnowBullet.gif""/> And finally, just in case you read that Laurie Penny article, you will now need what <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boing_Boing#Unicorn_chaser"">BoingBoing</a> call a 'unicorn chaser' to cheer you up. Here's the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9f-6jygRJk"">all-important video</a> of a Slow Lorris holding its little arms up so it can be tickled. 

* a note on apostrophes, which, let's face it, is the bit you care about most: I assumed that it was ""Publishers' Weekly"" because it's a weekly for publishers. Tim O'Reilly referred to it as ""Publisher's Weekly"" in his article. But their logo has no apostrophe at all, so I followed their lead.","","","","","2011-12-20","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

We wish you a merry new year and a happy 2012, as the song famously goes. Hope 2012 is a corker for you and - well, frankly, that you continue to buy a lot of our books. 

And if you're a writer, here's a sensible thing to do to kick off the new year. <a href=""http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/editorial/shops/instore_events.jsp""> Git yersen along</a> to Blackwell in Oxford on 19th January to learn from the queen of writing to be published, Nicola Morgan. 

More info below the cut. It's incredibly worthwhile, and highly recommended.","Workshop with Nicola Morgan: Write to be Published
Thursday 19th January, 7pm - 9pm

How do you make a publisher (or agent) say yes? During this workshop, Nicola Morgan will show you how publishing decisions are made, what ingredients are needed to make a publishable book, and how to create a 25-word pitch for your book, whatever the genre. 

Nicola Morgan is an award-winning writer for young people, a respected blogger and writer about writing and the publishing industry and an experienced public speaker. She has had around 90 books published, comprising novels, non-fiction and educational books. 


To register for this workshop (20), please visit or telephone our Literature/Languages Desk on the First Floor. (01865 333611). We are also offering a book and workshop combination which means that you can purchase both the book and a place on this workshop for 25 - the perfect gift for the would-be published writer?","","","","2011-12-31","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","2"

Stick around in publishing - or any business, I'll bet - for long enough and things get a sort of momentum of their own. I was procrastinating today, reading the Guardian, and came across <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2012/jan/09/summer-of-cycling-bike-organisations"">this article</a> from one of our authors, Carlton Reid, author of the mighty fine <a href=""https://snowbooks.bibliocloud.com/webs/133"">Family Cycling</a>. The article's nothing to do with the book (well, both are about cycling, but that's about all), but it was nice to see an article by one of our own. 

And then I get a marketing email from Amazon, about steampunk. It might be because I - obviously - look at a fair number of Snowbooks' titles on Amazon, but it was funny to see five of the eight books in the Amazon email were our own. It's even weirder to see Amazon reviews where the writer cites other Snowbooks' titles (along the lines of 'I liked this book, but this other book was even better'). The writer didn't seem to know the two books were published by the same company - we just seem to be relatively dominant in our sphere. 

Like I say, I suppose this sort of thing just comes from being around for a while. The other huge benefit of that, I was thinking today, is that we're so practiced. We can get a book out the door - if we feel like it - in about a day (with the exception of editing and proofreading. Ain't no shortcut for that). Not that we do. But we could. Cover design, writing blurbs, typesetting, generating printer files, getting the metadata done, uploading things to Amazon, informing retailers, sourcing printers, sending out review copies, publishing to the website - we've done it a bazillion times before, we're good at it, we can do it quickly and it's fun. 

Whilst it was exciting to be a start up, it's absolutely magical to be established.","","","","","2012-01-09","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","3"

Well, that's a chirpy title for <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2012/01/16/ratcliff-e-books/"">an article</a>, isn't it?

The article contrasts how you sell a pbook* and the kind of money you make, set against the evolving practice and profitability of selling ebooks, and it's based on his recent first-hand experiences.

*It's probably annoyingly faddy and jargonistic of me to refer to paper books as pbooks. On the other hand, 'paper books' sounds stilted and I'm tired of calling them 'traditional books'.

Today great chunks of the internet are offline as a protest against the SOPA and PIPA legislation that the U.S. Congress is soon to vote on. Like many pieces of anti-piracy legislation, it seems very happy to throw a lot of babies out with what might be a very small amount of bathwater. It contains a lot of bad ideas that have been proposed (and even partly adopted) before and will be again.

The heart of the debate is ""how far will we go to defend the interests of copyright holders?"" If you're an author or a publisher you probably have a dog in this race. You probably don't want to make it easy for people to use your copyrighted works without your permission. And when I've mentioned this subject before I've got the impression from the comments that many visitors here are in favour of very strong protection of copyright. For instance, when I've complained about the works of dead authors being protected for fifty or seventy years after their death, some commenters have questioned whether those protections should ever expire. I mean, why should what amounts to your personal property ever pass into public ownership?","But I think we need to concede that ideas are not the same sort of property as food or shoes. If I quote Shakespeare, I'm not apparently taking anything away from him; I'm helping keep his work alive. As the saying goes: ""The biggest threat to your work is not piracy, it's obscurity."" But if you're a living author you still might object to me 'quoting' your book in its entirety and telling you I'm doing you a favour.

I think, though, we have to accept that works shouldn't be 100% protected. For instance, imagine you could copyright a really well turned phrase and collect royalties whenever anyone wished to use it. Perhaps you spent a whole year coming up with it and feel you deserve remuneration when anyone threatens to pirate it. If protection like that had existed since, say, 1800, imagine how stilted the typical novel would now be as it attempted not to pay out a fortune in well-turned-phrase royalties. Likewise if you could copyright the idea of a detective novel or a happy ending there'd only be a handful of books in most of today's more popular genres. A society that offered protections like that to authors would make a handful of friends and a vast number of enemies amongst its citizens. It would also spend a lot of money protecting the few against the majority.

Somewhere along the line it became obvious that what is good for an author is not always good for authors in general or society as a whole. We don't want to protect one dead author's works at the expense of every writer who comes afterwards who wants to do something similar - and at the expense of all the readers who don't want just one version of a story, they want a whole section of the book store exploring that theme.

So societies weigh the cost of protecting an author's work against the expense of that protection and the damage that protection will do elsewhere. Without any protection, perhaps all authors would stop writing (though I highly doubt it). But too much protection (as mentioned above) can throttle creativity even more surely than too little. After all, more people will write for free than will write with the threat of litigation hanging over them.

In other words, protecting authors incentivises them to write (because it permits the possibility of making a living that way) but limiting that protection keeps the playing field open and level, and allows writing as a whole to flourish. Limiting protection also limits the burden on society of enforcing copyright.

For scientific developments the balance is slightly shifted. If a medicine comes off patent, we can all benefit from it, but without patents there's no way to make back the huge R&D costs of developing new treatments, so society attempts to grant just enough protection to encourage future development before it turns new ideas over to the public domain. And don't forget, for many patents it's a race: lots of people are working on the same idea, but society chooses to reward only the first to finish. That's not about encouraging innovation so much as encouraging speed.

And then there's the question of all the 'grandfathering' that goes on. You can get into trouble for printing unlicenced copies of a Lichtenstein or Warhol print. But those artists made their names by freely stealing and reusing other people's artwork without permission. And for all that Justin Bieber's music company wants heavyweight copyright protection, Justin himself got started making YouTube videos of other people's songs. And as the very funny TV show Community pointed out: if the schoolkids from Glee tried to sing those songs in real life, they'd be asked to pay big money for them or they'd be shut down.

Many (most?) artists have made free use of every work that came before them but then they, or more likely their management companies, try to ban anyone else from doing the same. Or at least companies insist that creators of derivative works must pay for the privilege in a way that they themselves didn't. The authors of the SOPA and PIPA legislation seem to consider every YouTube homage, mashup or re-enactment as piracy but they also want to benefit from buzz and viral marketing. They want everyone to obsess over their new movie, just not in any way they might be able to charge you for.

As Naomi Klein pointed out in No Logo, Disney wants your child to have a Lion King backpack, pencil case, lunchbox, video game, colouring book, duvet cover and wall poster. But they also want such tight control over their brand that you're not allowed to hang that child's drawing of Simba on a classroom wall. I mean *of course* Disney want that. The question is whether society as a whole wants to put their effort into granting and enforcing that level of control.

To turn to SOPA and PIPA specifically, they attempt to enforce far-reaching copyright control by altering the technical and also the legal underpinnings of the internet. On the legal side they want copyright holders to be able to have websites taken down immediately if they are hosting pirated content. Which sounds reasonable. But 'immediately' means without having to go through a tedious court case - or even showing any evidence. It is enough simply to accuse. And there are no penalties for making a wrongful accusation. Moreover 'immediately' also means shutting down the server on which the (possibly) pirated content is hosted - even if it means taking down a dozen other websites too.

That would be bad enough if we could trust copyright holders to be scrupulously honest, but under the current U.S. legislation (the Digital Millenium Copyright Act - DMCA) 'take down' notices are often used to silence critics rather than to prevent piracy.

Worse still, the plan is to make the hosting company responsible for whatever their customers put on their servers. So if you upload something to YouTube that infringes copyright it's not just you who are breaking the law, it's YouTube. Once one has factored in the cost of a copyright lawyer spending a day on each YouTube video attempting to research the relevant intellectual property ownership it becomes pretty clear that YouTube would no longer be viable. Which not-exactly-incidentally would be a boon for the TV companies insisting on SOPA/PIPA - by shutting down their competition in the name of piracy-protection they could receive a commercial boost too by decimating the world of user-generated content.

And that's even supposing it were possible to recognise every scrap of copyrighted video and every bar of a protected melody. Depending on one's interpretation of this legislation Google would also have to go - because hosting a link to pirated material is also punishable. And for the same reason Facebook and Twitter would be under threat.

In fact if you wanted to get, say, the New York Times website taken off the internet you'd simply have to post a few links in the comments to harmless looking sites, which actually offered pirated copies of Dumb and Dumber, and then issue a 'take down' notice for repeated copyright violation. The only sensible policy in such a world is to drastically limit file hosting and the posting of comments as well as the inclusion of links to anything you don't control.

Of course those demanding this level of protection (mainly the Hollywood and music industries' lobbyists) constantly fall foul of it themselves - not that they care. Illegal downloads of movies and music have been traced to computers in Congress, but presumably Congress isn't going to ban itself from the internet. And Lamar Smith, one of the Congressmen behind the SOPA legislation would have had his website taken down under the new legislation. He used a picture of some foliage as a backdrop on his site, but he didn't credit the picture's original owner as required by the photo's licence (<a href=""http://www.vice.com/read/lamar-smith-sopa-copyright-whoops"">link</a>). If this becomes all it takes to silence someone online, the internet could get very quiet very quickly.

And that's just the legal side. SOPA and PIPA also mandate some re-engineering of the internet's infrastructure. When you type a website name into your browser, your computer turns that into a string of numbers which, like the internet equivalent of a phone number, allows you to contact that website and fetch pages from it. These numbers are called IP addresses and the service that allows web names (like snowbooks.com) to be turned into IP addresses (like 74.86.153.134) is called DNS. It acts like a phone directory and SOPA/PIPA would give enforcement agencies the power to edit those DNS directories (which are spread all over the web) and to delete entries that were deemed undesirable. By removing a website from DNS you'd make it impossible to find. Except that geeks have already found ways round that - but SOPA/PIPA in turn gets round<em> that</em> problem by making it illegal to circumvent the deletion of DNS entries. 

Now in countries like North Korea and Syria and China there are similar rules, but they are used principally to silence dissent, and the U.S. State Department is wholeheartedly against them. But SOPA/PIPA would introduce the same mechanisms of online information control (albeit serving corporate not dictatorial ends) and would ban the creation of any tools to circumvent that control. In other words, you wouldn't be able to find ways round internet censorship in China because that same technology might also be used to download an illegal copy of Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo.

Moreover, building mechanisms that could be used for censorship into what has traditional been a free internet is not a development that pleases advocates of free speech. America effectively controls much of the internet because it originated much of the technology and because it has had the good sense to keep its hands off the controls. If Congress builds censorship technology into the internet it stands to lose America its position as the notional headquarters of the web - which might not be a bad thing in the long run, but it's almost certainly not what most of America wants.

Even if SOPA and PIPA are defeated, this is not a debate that will go away. On the internet it's ridiculously easy to copy everything: ideas, movies, music, schematics, blueprints, personal information and leaked e-mails. And it's going to keep getting easier as computers, software and networks get more powerful. But those who stand to have their business models swept away will want to take steps to prevent the copying that threatens them. Sometimes they will have good ideas about how to do that. Sometimes they will just want to be put in charge of everything so that they can ensure no one is misbehaving - and when that happens they need to be stopped. But it's not a problem that is going to evaporate.

If you want to know more about where this debate is going, I wholeheartedly recommend watching Cory Doctorow's talk on The Coming War on General Computation (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYqkU1y0AYc"">link</a>). It's really worth listening to his explanation of why this is such an important and difficult problem, but to give you a taste, he explains how we keep trying to ban people using technologies in ways we don't like by assuming it's like banning mobile phone use in cars: you can ban it and people can still use their cars. But limiting piracy on the internet is more like trying to build a car that can't be used in a bank robbery but can be used in any other way - and that's a much more difficult problem. And as Cory points out, even if you're against strong copyright controls for books and movies, you might find that you're in favour of censorship when it comes to downloading and printing out copies of the smallpox virus, for instance. 

So. Lots to ponder. But in the meantime, I hope Congress will bury SOPA and PIPA, that they'll give at least equal weight to their voters as to their corporate lobbyists, and that next time they'll read up on what they're planning to re-engineer.

<em>Addendum</em>: Also, <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/defend_our_freedom_to_share_or_why_sopa_is_a_bad_idea.html"">here</a>'s Clay Shirky giving a quick talk at the TED offices about the background to SOPA/PIPA as well as its implications. He's firmly against the legislation, so he's a little one-sided perhaps - that said, I think he's being accurate in what he says, plus I happen to agree with him.

Did you watch the second season of the BBC's Sherlock? You might just about be able to catch all three movie-length episodes on <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00m5wm9/Sherlock_Series_2_A_Scandal_in_Belgravia/"">iPlayer</a> if you're quick. I'm all conflicted about it. The first ep was absolutely wonderful. The second episode disappointed me. The third episode left me fuming. 

Comprehensive spoilers ahead.","I'm a big fan of TV that rewards the attentive viewer. It's a discussion for another day, but I believe we're moving towards an era where entertainment is increasingly geared towards smaller audiences who <em>love</em> something rather than huge audiences who are ambivalent. And I loved the Scandal in Belgravia debut episode of this year's Sherlock season.

Steven Moffat on a good day creates fiendishly complex plots which <em>actually make sense</em> with hindsight and he packs them with humour. On a <em>really</em> good day he also gets the drama right. I found I had a piece of dust in my eye at the very end of A Scandal in Belgravia, when Irene Adler faces the chop. I watched the episode again a few days later and found the same piece of dust once again troubling me. Given what a macho brute I am, and how fiercely out of touch with my emotions I am, it's pretty impressive for what is ostensibly a funny intellectual puzzle to move me, even as a 'repeat'.

I've said it before, but Mark Gatiss seems like a lovely fellow. He's charming, funny and intelligent, and he seems like a pretty decent actor too. But I have yet to enjoy his writing. With s02e01, Moffat gave us riddles to solve against the clock while our heroes had a gun to their heads. in s02e02, Gatiss gave us what amounted to dream sequences. And once I'd worked out that people were hallucinating, the tension evaporated and my interest along with it. Ep 1 had thrills; ep 2 had scares: scares of the sudden-loud-noise or monster-jumping-out kind. We've all seen a hundred million of those and they're not traditionally what we demand of a detective show.

And with Sherlock of all shows you can't use the excuse ""it's only TV; you're not supposed to think about it too much.""

But it's s02ep3, The Reichenbach Fall, that was in danger of undoing all the good work that Scandal in Belgravia had done in making me a giant fan of the series. Detective shows are about solving puzzles. Half the fun is trying to beat the detective to the answer. Scandal in Belgravia delivered in abundance. On the other hand, the Reichenbach Fall was full of puzzles that were later dismissed, puzzles where the answer was the first thing anyone would think of, puzzles where the answer didn't make sense and puzzles which were simply not answered, or even addressed, presumably to be picked up in 12 months' time when we can hardly remember what the question was.

In s02e01, we had puzzles like 'how was the hiker killed', 'what's the combination to the safe?', 'what's the password to the phone?' and 'why wasn't the dead man on the flight?' We were given hints and partial clues - enough to solve the riddles - or at least to have the solutions make you slap your palm to your forehead - all the while being dazzled by the dialogue and swept up in the drama. What was Irene Adler's game and were she and Sherlock really engaged in some sort of romantic dance or was it all a smokescreen? Every one of these intellectual or emotional questions was paid off in a satisfying, intelligent and frequently exhilarating way.

In s02e03 we had the questions of 'what does i.o.u. mean?', 'what is the final problem moriarty refers to?', 'what are the professional killers up to?', 'where are the kidnapped children being held?', 'how did moriarty pull off those break ins?', 'how did moriarty get acquitted?', 'how did moriarty create a fake persona as a TV presenter?' and 'where was the secret key hidden?'. The answers to the first two were simply not addressed. The answer to the question of the killers... just didn't make sense. They were told to 'get Sherlock' which they apparently interpreted to mean saving his life and bumping each other off (but only when one of them touched Sherlock) until... they could work out through lots of quiet contemplation where he'd stashed the key, presumably? And they were working for themselves hunting for the non-existent key until Moriarty wanted them to become a threat at which point they were to be considered utterly dedicated to killing Sherlock's friends unless called off by Moriarty. Couldn't Sherlock have offered them the (non-existent) key to bribe them to let his pals live? Apparently not. Or were the hired killers ready to bump off Sherlock's friends a different group from the hired killers protecting him? Who knows. Killers, killers everywhere and not a drop of sense.

The answer to where the children were imprisoned involved some nineteenth century chemistry performed upon the residue dissolved in the footprints from Moriarty's shoe. The business with the linseed oil seemed to be a failed attempt by the kidnapped boy to lead the police to his abductors, but it had the (presumably unintended) effect of allowing Sherlock to identify all the traces on Moriarty's shoe. And the implication was that Moriarty knew Sherlock would pursue this approach and was even hinting that he had left a breadcrumb trail. But wasn't the linseed oil the boy's idea not Moriarty's? All very confusing. And all very unconvincing. Not to mention technically hokey. Steve Thompson (= the writer) has clearly never seen CSI or read a book on forensics: I could almost believe a mass-spectrometer could identify invisible microscopic residue, but I just can't buy the bubbling test tubes and litmus paper approach. 

And more importantly when considering that this is a detective show, these weren't answers you could work out given the clues and which, with hindsight, seemed impressively logical; they were ad-hoc nonsense.

The answers to the questions about the robberies, the acquittal and presumably also the fake persona (though this also was never addressed) was even more of a let-down. Moriarty simply threatened or bribed a few key people. Just the sort of thing the police, even without any help from Sherlock, would normally suspect, and which they would presumably uncover fairly quickly. As intriguing mysteries go, this is akin to discovering that a burglar got into a house by breaking a window. Or was it a sneaky double-bluff: you thought this was an interesting puzzle but really it was boring. If so, I'm not impressed.

And as for the secret key, it never existed. So Moriarty had the entire underworld bidding for his services knowing that he couldn't deliver. Or could only deliver to the extent that ordinary bribery and threats could achieve. Presumably this was a cunning plan on Moriarty's part to anger every powerful criminal in the world and to make himself look like a fraud. How accidentally ironic, given that Moriarty was so intent on making Sherlock appear to be a fraud. And the court case would have sealed his fate by letting all these potential criminal employers know what he looked like. Or would the world's crime lords suddenly decide that Moriarty was really a kid's TV presenter because The Sun said so? Who gets the world's rogue states bidding for their time and then announces that really they work for CBeebies? It's probably a good job Moriarty shot himself because his days were presumably numbered.

Which leads me to the final plot point I absolutely do not buy. It makes no sense that Moriarty was desperate to destroy Sherlock but wouldn't bother to stick around to see it happen. It wasn't enough to discredit Sherlock; Moriarty needed him to admit defeat and take his own life. If that final submission was so important, why blow your brains out on a whim and miss it? Moreover the reasoning for Moriarty taking his own life appeared to be that Sherlock would be able to make him call off the assassins otherwise. Moriarty had withstood weeks of torture by professional intelligence types lead by Mycroft (who in the books was considered even more intelligent than Sherlock). But apparently on the basis of some really solid eye contact, Moriarty conceded that Sherlock could swiftly break him, and so quickly committed suicide.

The possibility that Moriarty too was faking his own death doesn't make that whole plot point easier to digest. It just makes a mockery of the whole showdown by having both participants fake their own suicides in quick succession.

The one thing which might have partially salvaged The Reichenbach Fall for me would have been appending the words ""To Be Continued"" to the closing scene. At least then I would have felt all the ridiculous loose ends and nonsensical plot points were being acknowledged. I would still consider that a movie-length episode is enough time to wrap up a story. I would also consider it a tactical miscalculation to build dramatic tension for two hours and then offer to resolve the whole thing in a year's time. But they didn't even do that. They simply ended the episode.

I suppose I should concede that the question of how Sherlock faked his own death might prove to be a satisfying riddle suitably in keeping with the spirit of the show. On the other hand, we've got 12 months or so to work out the answer and I suspect that the internet has already assembled all the important pieces of the puzzle. By the time Christmas 2012 rolls around we're not going to be wowed by a pile of bin bags, a corpse borrowed from Molly's mortuary and a whiff of the HOUND drug from ep 2 for Watson. Plus I'm already suspicious that the reason Watson couldn't be in on the deception will prove to be 'because otherwise the killers wouldn't have been convinced' - which, if that's the explanation given, I'm not going to buy. A bit of blubbing at the funeral and most professional killers would be satisfied I reckon.

And finally, I don't see what the finale episode achieves for the series as a whole except to set up a lot of annoying obstacles to good storytelling next year. Sherlock presumably can't easily go back to being a detective because he is now famous for being a) a fraud and b) dead. He can't go back to working with the police given the appalling press the police will have received for inviting in a charlatan who rigged dozens of their cases. Or will an episode of next season be spent erasing all those obstacles rather than letting us have intriguing crimes to solve?

If you'd asked me about Sherlock after s02e01 I'd have said the show is one of the best things I've seen on TV. Having seen eps 2 and especially 3, I'm not sure what to make of it all. Clearly they're capable of amazing things. I'll have my fingers crossed that they manage something amazing again - at least once - next season.","","","","2012-01-19","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","4"

For a while now I've been mentally preparing for a world where non-fiction books could go digital and could contain interactive, intelligent, visually responsive content. Last year I talked about the possibilities <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/07/ebooks_part_ii.html"">here</a>. If Adobe were on the ball, they'd have created a platform for these things, but they seem to be letting the world of e-books pass them by. Unsurprisingly, Apple have stepped into the breach and produced a free authoring program for creating interactive textbooks. You can go <a href=""http://www.apple.com/education/#video-textbooks"">here</a> and see their video about the ideas behind  this new technology and what it's already capable of. Yes, the video is full of treacle and meaningful shots of multi-ethnic kids smiling, but I defy you to not get a little bit excited about the potential here. I've already downloaded a free copy of <a href=""http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/"">iBooks Author</a> and when I get a chance I'm going to properly explore it. And remember, this is Version 1. Apple have a strong history of building on their innovations until they really create something powerful.

Downsides: to run iBooks Author you'll need a Mac. And it'll need to be running Lion, the latest version of the OS. Other downsides: if you work in non-fiction publishing you've suddenly got a <em>lot</em> more work to do.

<strong><em>update</em></strong>: check out my follow-up <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2012/01/ibooks_caveats.html"">post</a> with what I consider is some solidly bad news about the iBooks 2.0 platform.","","","","","2012-01-20","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

<a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/07/ebooks_part_ii.html"">Imagining</a> a new way of learning and then seeing someone build it (and show it off in a slick, glossy <a href=""http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/"">video</a>) is a very exciting experience (as I mentioned in my last <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2012/01/books_that_teach.html"">post</a>). Last night I did a bit more reading about the iBooks 2.0 format on which this new Apple interactive textbook platform is based and I'm now 30% less enthused. Maybe as much as 60% less. It's difficult to get a really accurate figure until the field of neuroscience advances a little, but suffice it to say the latest weather forecast for the iBooks parade now includes rain.

When I started getting excited about<a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ibooks-author/id490152466?mt=12""> iBooks Author</a>, the program Apple has just released for creating these interactive textbooks, it was largely because I thought they were building an ecosystem in which the textbook industry could make their new home. And perhaps they will. But this first version appears to be a closed system: you use an Apple program to make a book you can only read through Apple's iBooks software and can only sell through its iBooks store. And you can't easily carry over the work you've put into that book into a version that works elsewhere because you can't export your designs into other, more open formats. And since the iBooks 2.0 format is chock full of undocumented features it's going to be very difficult for anyone to write a conversion tool. Sad face.","I learned about this because clever internet people have already pulled the back off the iBooks 2.0 format and started tracing the wires. What they've found is an e-book format based on ePub3 - which should be good news, because it's an open standard likely to be very widely adopted. And when you consider that ePub3 in turn is based on HTML5 and CSS3, the new standards for the World Wide Web itself, that sounds like a great starting point.

The bad news begins with what Apple have done to ePub3. Because in its standard form it didn't allow the functionality they wanted, they extended it and in doing so added lots of their own unorthodox syntax - syntax that would not just be ignored by ePub readers but would almost certainly trip them up. Apple also opted to achieve lots of the clever animations and interactivity using little programs, called 'gadgets', that they wrote themselves and which are basically black boxes as far as the rest of the industry is concerned.

The neighbourly way to add cool new features to web sites (and so logically the way to do the same in a format based on web standards) would have been to write those gadgets in JavaScript. That's how Google Maps and GMail do all sorts of things that no web page ever did before. But iBooks 2.0 doesn't go down that route. It adds in lots of custom-built modules that only Apple understand and controls them with lots of custom-built syntax that Apple haven't documented.

I have to say, based on these revelations, this first iteration of iBooks textbooks is sounding like a very beautiful dead end. I'm particularly disappointed that the EULA apparently prevents you selling the books you create with iBooks Author anywhere other than the iBooks store. It all seems a little short-sighted to me. Given that most people will want the option to read textbooks on something hand-held rather than a laptop or desktop, it seems to me that this is all about iPads. iPads are fabulous and they've sold very well, but I can't see most publishers committing to them so thoroughly and exclusively at this stage. 

It's early days yet, but this seems like a mis-step to me. This is the sort of behaviour we used to get from the bad old Microsoft who were always trying to slap the handcuffs on their customers to stop them wandering away. And Microsoft too were insouciant to an extent that seemed like actual contempt towards open standards that the rest of the technical world had painstakingly built. We're still living with the legacy of Internet Explorer which seemed designed to lock its users into Microsoft products by locking out any regions of the web that were based purely on internationally agreed standards. It's a shame if Apple are now trying the same thing. 

Apple clearly had to go beyond existing standards if their interactive textbooks were to do all the cool things Apple wanted, and it's great that they began their work from the base of ePub3. But they appear to have built a cramped little 'walled garden' where you can't get outside content in and you can't get inside content out. You have to use an Apple product to put together an Apple book and then you have to read it on an Apple device. That sounds like far too much 'lock in' for a new platform. And unless they start building some doors into their walled garden I don't see iBooks textbooks being anything other than a beautiful novelty.

P.S. I've been rather harsh and dismissive about the fact that Adobe haven't provided decent e-book creation tools yet - despite making the dominant DTP app - and I continued to be critical of them when I first saw iBooks Author because it looked like they were allowing Apple to set about eating their lunch on a persistent and ongoing basis. But perhaps Adobe still have a chance. If they're frantically working on something that helps the majority of the publishing industry produce this and the next generation of e-books then they might still be in with a chance. And I'm not talking about a clunky add-in to InDesign like their current e-book export fudge.


P.P.S. Amazon have just released the first round of tools to allow the outer tier of publishers (i.e. those not on best buddy terms with Amazon) to start producing KF8 e-books that will run on their Fire tablet and presumably elsewhere. When I get a minute I'm going to take a look at those tools and report back on what I find.

<img src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/SnowBullet.gif""/> You might not have to upgrade to the latest version of the Mac OS to use iBooks Author after all. Supposedly it's for Lion only, but tech-minded tinkerers seem to have got it to work with Snow Leopard. See <a href=""http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/20/install-ibooks-author-on-mac-os-x-10-6-8-snow-leopard/"">here</a> for the fiddly details.
<img src=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/SnowBullet.gif""/> Apparently the EULA that comes with iBooks Author is the most greedy, grabby agreement of its kind according to someone who examines them for a living. See <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/apples-mind-bogglingly-greedy-and-evil-license-agreement/4360"">here</a>. Apparently it attempts to control what you can do with the documents you create. People have likened it to trying to control what you can do with a Word document you write.

All in all, Apple seem to have taken a great idea - bring the world interactive textbooks - and done a slightly sleazy, short-sighted and tight-fisted job of it.","","","","","2012-01-23","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

And that being the case, it's a big reason why someone should get busy on the whole cross-platform interactive book idea that Apple may have just bungled.

The extent to which I don't have my finger on the common pulse is considerable. For instance, I rarely get my news from TV, which means the current-affairs I know about tends to be skewed towards what <em>seems</em> bad when you think about it rather than on what <em>looks</em> bad when you watch the video of it. But even without all the Mayan calendar nonsense about 2012 being the end of the line, I keep picking up the vibe that lots of people think the end of the world is coming. Soonish.

More and more I read about people obsessing about where they live, where they stash their money or  what sort of supplies they keep in the house all considered in the light of Something Bad Happening. And I suspect one of the reasons for the explosion of interest in zombies of late is that it gives us all a chance to consider ""what would I do in that situation?"". <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_%28TV_series%29"">The Walking Dead</a> is a chance for us all to do a bit of personal End of Days planning. And in fact you can find scads of answers to the question of how we should respond to the undead overrunning the Earth from everyone from the <a href=""http://www.bt.cdc.gov/socialmedia/zombies_blog.asp"">CDC</a> to multi-tool maker, Gerber's, Apocalypse <a href=""http://www.gerbergear.com/Apocalypse/Gear/Apocalypse-Kit_30-000601"">Kit</a>.

As well as evangelicals worrying about The Rapture and the rest of us contemplating the Zombie Apocalypse, we've got the real life prospect of climate disaster, we've got the potential catastrophic lock-up of the global banking industry, we've got wars and famines, we've got terrorist threats and we've got periodic panics over pathogens like H1N1 and SARS. And I suppose people can be forgiven for letting those threats seep into the general psyche because - after all - they are real (well, except for terrorism, which statistically speaking, is <a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2011/09/06/how-scared-of-terrorism-should"">insignificant</a> in the West)","We've always had Survivalists. I suppose if you go back far enough, most people in history were effectively survivalists. But serious interest in what is now called 'Preparedness' waned after the end of the Cold War. Bunkers went out of fashion. And people stopped worrying about whether they had enough candles and tinned food in the house. But if you take a look online now you'll find a lot of very serious thought going into 'prepping' for when SHTF* and we end up WROL*. You can buy <a href=""http://survivalcache.com/bug-out-bag/"">Bug-Out Bags</a> from mainstream <a href=""www.google.co.uk/search?q=bug+out+bag&ie=UTF-8#q=bug+out+bag"">manufacturers</a>. And there are many sites where you can compare your Everyday Carry (<a href=""http://everyday-carry.com/"">EDC</a>) with others.

And among those who don't wish they had a nickel-plated pump-action Mossberg shotgun to fend off the zombies with you can still pick up hints of 'prepping'. Twenty years ago I didn't know many young women who weaved, knitted, grew their own vegetables or made their own clothes. Now the internet is packed with them. In a world where it's easier and cheaper than ever to rely on shops for everything, more and more people are interested in providing for themselves. Handy, if shops ever become a thing of the past.

And given that this is a publishing blog I should mention all those manuals of recent years that teach you how to survive a myriad of life-threatening situations. Why on earth have SAS Survival guides and Worst Case Scenario handbooks sold so well to comfy urbanites? 

So what do you reckon? Have you noticed more than the usual amount of armageddon-ism and what I've come to call 'pre-apocalyptic tension'? And if you have, what do you think it all means?

This is for Mac only. Open the Terminal application. Change into the directory which contains both your XML and XSL files by entering the file path:

cd path/to/your/folder

You can use XSL to transform any sort of XML file. For instance, you might want to convert an ONIX file from its short-tag version to the long reference tag version. Run:

xsltproc shorttolong.xsl short.XML -o long.xml

That syntax is: call the command 'xsltproc'. (The libraries are built in to OSX, so you don't need to have installed anything to get this to work.) Give the name of the XSL file you want to use. Then give the name of the XML file you want to transform. Write -o, and then give the name you want the output file to have.

I've always assumed that academic journals are a force for good because they're the keepers of science's most important documents: the basic research papers themselves. Moreover, journals are part of the mechanism of peer-review which keeps science headed in the right (=truth-seeking) direction. I <em>had</em> noticed that many journals were kind of expensive - scarily so for multi-user licences - but without knowing the business model, I just assumed there was a good reason for that. But increasingly I'm learning disquieting things which suggest that some journals have effectively become toll-gates through which vital information is forced to pass. I've also been struck by the argument that virtually all of the research that appears in scientific journals is wholly or partly funded with public money, and yet if you want to see what your taxes paid for, you have to enrich a private company first. And worse still, scientists themselves have to pay to see each others' publicly funded work.

I imagine that there are significant costs involved in producing academic journals but I would have expected in the e-book age we might have seen prices beginning to fall for digital versions of articles. After all, if scientists write the papers at no charge to the journal, then other academics peer review those papers at no charge to the journal, can a digital download of that paper <em>really</em> cost that much to produce? Well, perhaps it can, but I do feel these journals have some questions to answer given the important and highly privileged position that many of them occupy.","And it appears that enough academics have become unhappy enough with the state of affairs that they have organised a <a href=""http://thecostofknowledge.com/"">boycott</a> of the worst offender, as they see it: Elsevier. The Bookseller have an article about it <a href=""http://www.thebookseller.com/news/academics-call-boycott-elsevier.html"">here</a>. And the ever-inflammatory George Monbiot has a pretty damning breakdown of what's wrong in the world of academic publishing <a href=""http://www.monbiot.com/2011/08/29/the-lairds-of-learning/"">here</a>. 

It seems strange as other sectors in publishing get used to a year-on-year squeeze that one sector is getting accused of profiteering. But then again, there is intense competition in every area of mainstream book retailing, whereas the big names in academic publishing seem to have found something akin to a monopoly. 

I think increasingly in the twenty-first century we have to accept that a lot of 'middle man' jobs will go away. Music fans and their favourite bands don't necessarily need a record company in the middle trying to make a profit. Likewise, the science community may find its members can communicate among themselves better without certain publishers being involved. I think the key difference in all these situations will be whether those in the middle work hard to be facilitators, or whether they seem themselves as toll collectors (c.f. the SOPA/PIPA debacle where Hollywood was so fixated on acquiring powers to protect their business model that they managed to provoke millions of ordinary citizens into opposing them.)

P.S. The last time I had occasion to consider the Elsevier name was grumping that their parent, Reed Elsevier, organised UK trade shows for the world's arms manufacturers (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Elsevier#Defence_exhibitions"">link</a>). I believe they have now withdrawn from that line of work.","","","","2012-02-01","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

That syntax, broken down: 

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep"">grep</a>
-n - gives the line number of the problem in the output
-P - tells the computer that there is a Perl regular expression coming up. Perl is a programming language. That's about all I know about it. Doesn't stop me from using it. 
""[\x80-\xFF]"" - the pattern you want the computer to look for. This will find all characters which are in the range 0x80 to 0xFF.*

* Eh? you say. Characters don't look like that. They look like this: ""a"", or ""d"", or, rather exotically, ""z"". Yes they do, but computers are funny. Computers like lists, and order, and to know exactly what's what. A computer likes to use a system known as ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) just to be on the safe side, so that if it's handed a character, it can be sure it knows which character you mean. If you use a character on the ASCII list, you know that your computer - and pretty much any computer software - is going to be able to handle it. The ASCII list assigns values to the most-used characters, using a variety of codes. The letter 'a', for instance, is ""61"" in hexadecimal code. 

0x80 (one of the codes we use in the pattern, here) is a computer-y way of saying the number you probably know as 128, or CXXVIII if you're still into Roman numerals, or 80 if you've been looking at the hexadecimal color picker in Photoshop for too long. 0xFF is 255, or CCLV, or FF. Those pesky non-ASCII characters which don't display on your screen and which bugger up your XML are all in that range.","","","","2012-02-01","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","0"

It's a tricky thing to rail against the march of technology. It's very easy to seem like a grumpy old fool - even if you have a point. And it's an activity with an embarrassing history. You risk joining the ranks of people who thought phones, computers, trains, cars, television and the internet were silly fads. Jonathan Franzen takes a <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/9047981/Jonathan-Franzen-e-books-are-damaging-society.html"">crack at it</a> in the context of e-books, and I have to say I think he makes a hash of it. He comes at e-books from a couple of angles, starting by pointing out their flaws compared with a paperback. Paperbacks are cheap and robust so: ""No wonder capitalists hate them."" What? And he seems to suggest that ink is more respectful of good work than a digital file. Then he stumbles into the weeds by suggesting that the impermanence of digital books might just undermine society. 

There's a pretty good response to this silliness by NYT science writer <a href=""http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/01/31/ebooks-more-boon-to-literacy-than-threat-to-democracy/"">Carl Zimmer</a> at Discover Magazine. But Franzen, like so many people who rant about the internet, fails to understand what he's looking at. By creating millions of copies of a book, digitally locking each one and then distributing them around the world, a book can achieve permanence with a thousand times the speed of a paper book. Whatever evil lurks within the idea of electronic publishing, I'm pretty sure it's not on the list Jonathan Franzen has drawn up.

If you read his words <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/9047981/Jonathan-Franzen-e-books-are-damaging-society.html"">summarised</a> in the Telegraph then I should say that I start to agree with him in the second half of the piece. It's great that President Obama can read at college-graduate level and does so voluntarily (unlike the previous incumbent). And I never tire of people pointing out that bankers and big business control the political process (I've been in the tiny majority who believed that for a while now and it's great to suddenly have so much company).","","","","","2012-02-05","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

We're in the dark about so many things and we realise that most clearly when groups like Anonymous spill the beans. This week they showed they could eavesdrop on the FBI making deals with the Metropolitan Police. Well, I for one want to know how much influence the U.S. has over the British justice system.

"42599","","1","The last mile","Publish","true","<div class=""pic""><img alt=""DeliveryBox.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/DeliveryBox.jpg"" width=""220"" height=""178"" /></div>

I spent a good chunk of 1999 working for a company that was busy pondering ways to solve the problem of 'the last mile' in internet delivery. At the end of the 90s it was clear that the world was going to order its goods online in ever-increasing numbers. But where were these goods to be delivered to? An empty house with its occupants out at work. We daydreamed about neighbourhood concierges, about petrol stations and post offices used as local collection depots, about lock-boxes in people's gardens. And on days when none of that seemed likely we imagined a disappointing Plan B where couriers narrowed their delivery windows to half-hour time slots and offered evening and weekend options. Not once did any of us working on that problem foresee that in the year 2012 online ordering would be the norm but most deliveries would work <em>in the exact same way</em> as 13 years before. 

I have a mobile phone being delivered tomorrow and Vodafone's text message on the matter says, ""<span style=""font-family: courier;"">Your delivery may arrive at any time between 8:00 and 18:00. Please ensure someone is available to sign for it.</span>"" Good job I'm not a high court judge or a rocket surgeon or something. I mean, staying at home for a day could be bad news if I was supposed to be directing air traffic somewhere. It's a version of 2012 that no sci-fi author of the 90s predicted.

For one or two abstruse meditations on how this problem might be solved continue reading. Strictly optional.

<em>update</em>: In the interests of fairness I should say that Vodafone texted mid-morning to let me know my delivery would arrive between 1:45 and 2:45. I'd have still had to take the whole day off, but at least I could have gone out to get some lunch.","The problem of vague courier delivery times stems in large part from the way they're organised: load up the van, head out on the road for half or all of the day, make deliveries in whichever order makes sense. It's not practical to head back to the depot between every delivery and so vans tend to be effectively off the radar for most of the day, with no one quite sure when they'll pop up.

What's needed are local delivery depots with local delivery routes - eminently possible in most places, given how incredibly densely populated most of the UK is. Instead of large depots feeding a fleet of vans that head out for many hours at a time, large depots need to feed numerous smaller depots. And those smaller depots needs to feed local delivery vehicles that return to the depot every hour at least. Those vehicles could be smaller and cheaper, in some instances a moped would suffice (greatly reducing the chances of getting stuck in traffic), their drivers could have much better local knowledge and the driver's stops could be planned to within 30 mins. If Pizza Hut can manage it, so can Parcelforce.

Maintaining this much infrastructure would be expensive, so it needs to be shared. In this modern age of outsourcing, coordinating between different courier companies should be easy, with the right computer systems. A 'backbone' or 'trunk' network could handle shipping between major collection depots and local delivery depots. Then local courier companies could handle local pickups and local deliveries.

Taking an idea from the world of taxis, it would even be possible to use a fleet of licensed, freelance couriers who use mobile computers to say which deliveries they want to be responsible for. Whoever is free can offer to take the next delivery. A large number of freelance courier vans would work more efficiently than each company having their own vans because excess capacity never costs a company money and that extra capacity goes wherever it is needed.

What doesn't work so well is a system with badly-run customer-facing websites and phone numbers that never get answered, and a huge number of wasted delivery trips caused by the fact that very few people can afford to stay at home on a week day for 8, 10 or 12 hours. 

Any guesses as to what the world of internet deliveries will look like in another 13 years? Better? The same? (And bonus marks to anyone suggesting ""worse, because a lot of it will be done using rowing boats"")","","","","2012-02-06","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

Why are scruffy paperbacks beautifully typeset, but anything goes with e-books, even when they're global bestsellers being read on a high-end tablet? It's something I've grumbled about in the past and my theory is that it's about new, fragmented workflows versus old, bedded-in ones. And it's about having the right tools. We've had a couple of decades to get the hang of typesetting for a fixed page-size on a computer and we've got dedicated software for the purpose in the form of QuarkXPress and latterly InDesign. In the world of e-books, it's still amateur hour. Which perhaps makes it easier for genuine amateurs to sell their wares among all the 'professional' disasters. On the other hand, if a dedicated publishing company finds it difficult to get things right, then it stands to reason the self-publishing novice can really struggle. <a href=""http://www.michaelastackpole.com/?p=3050"">Here's</a> an interesting blog post from author Michael Stackpole pointing out the worst e-book howlers and some tips on avoiding them.","","","","","2012-02-22","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","6"

I read The Hunger Games recently. I read the trilogy on my iPad using the Kindle app. There are a lot of Kindle books in the world and a lot of iPads. And The Hunger Games occupies four of the top ten positions in the Kindle Store. In other words, the collected edition of the trilogy is about as high-profile an e-book as it's possible to get. I mention this because different chapters were set in different sized fonts. One would be comically big, and I'd reduce the size. But in a few chapters' time the words would become tiny and I'd have to increase their size again. I'd guess there were four size changes in all, but it might have been more. It probably shouldn't annoy me, but it does. I've never encountered a cheap paperback in which the typesetting was as problematic as some of the multi-million bestselling e-books I've read. I understand that the technology isn't there yet to do the fancy stuff, but when you're sure you're going to sell more than a million copies of something, isn't it worth paying another hundred pounds and getting someone to check it? And unlike a huge paper print run, if you find out you've botched the typesetting, well we all make mistakes: just upload a corrected version.

I do not like paperwork. I do not like opening letters and having to do something with all that paper. I do not like the sensation of how unutterably bored I know I will be if I finally tackle it all. I do not like the scruffy mess it all makes. And yet I also do not like getting behind with paperwork or seeing a pile of untouched letters piling up on my desk. It seems like whatever I do it's going to make me miserable. It's a conundrum. And in the last few years I've had heaps of extra paperwork to tackle, enough to fill shelves and shelves. But all is not lost. I've never yet banished the forces of paperwork, but I have found a glint of hope, a golden thread to follow which leads out of the gloom. Stationery!

Lucy Mangan <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/29/why-i-love-stationery-pens"">has a piece</a> about her love of stationery in the Guardian today which is what prompted me to share this homily with you. And it occurred to me that the ranks of publishing and authoring must be chock full of receptive ears for a topic like this.

I can't remember who first used the term 'stationery tart' within my earshot. Quite possibly one of the many Emmas I know - specifically the one I met at college (known to me for a while as 'College Emma', and, now that she's married, as 'Mrs College Emma'). Anyway, the term seems to suggest that most people with a stationery fixation are of the feminine persuasion. But it includes me as well, with my love of pens and notebooks and choosing the right ink. Though tragically my handwriting is so appalling, my attempts at making presentable marks on paper such an unnatural struggle, that I'm like a dog who chases cars: I don't have much legitimate use for stationery even when I do catch it.

But fortunately for me, 'stationery' has a comely mate: 'office supplies' - specifically <em>premium</em> office supplies. So think less sturdy 5-star box files and more Muji's frosted-polypropylene wallets and folders, or Paperchase's coloured paperclips - maybe even WHSmith's Zebra G-301s.","<img alt=""G301.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/G301.jpg"" width=""490"" height=""65"" />

I combine these things with the Tolkienesque one-ring-to-rule-them-all: a Dymo label printer. I don't mean one of those handheld dealie-bobs that makes beautifully retro embossed plastic labelling strips. I mean a little USB-connected printer that you plug into your computer which makes perfect little self-adhesive labels. I use the appallingly-named Twin Turbo model because it lets me print big labels for addressing packages or small ones for labelling folders without manually changing reels. (Amazon UK <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/DYMO-LabelWriter-450-Twin-Turbo/dp/B000Q8S3X2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1330596764&sr=8-2"">link</a>)

If you remember your bible (Genesis 2:19), you'll recall that humanity (well, possibly just the men; the bible is pretty dude-centric in places) has a duty to get out there and name everything (and then have dominion over it). But what it doesn't mention - perhaps because it's implied - is that after you name something you're going to want to label it, else chaos ensues, and having dominion over things becomes one big muddle.

I've got maybe thirty folders and perhaps a hundred wallets of paperwork, and each one is neatly labelled. That not only creates the all-important aesthetic impression that all is Under Control, it also means there's a place for every piece of paper that enters The System. And if there isn't a place for it, I break out a fresh folder, print a new label and create that place. That means that there's never a backlog in filing (unless it's because of my laziness). Once paperwork has been read and acted upon, it can immediately join those of its ilk, in date order, neatly squared at the edges, paperclipped together, slipped into a wallet and stacked in a folder, lined up on a shelf. The end result is that paperwork feels considerably less daunting or boring. Instead it's like a very design-oriented game of Post Office, where every letter opened is a chance to use some piece of appealing stationery or some fun little machine. 

Naturally I have to hand a sheet or two of self-adhesive stamps from the actual Post Office, and a selection of DL, C4 and C5 envelopes - as well as padded envelopes in two sizes - so that outgoing post gets added to the pile with minimal delay.

I tend to briefly annotate each incoming letter before filing it, so that I have a written record of how I responded to it. I use a nice 0.5mm red Muji gel pen.

Then I make a note of what I've done in my date-ordered <a href=""http://www.evernote.com/"">Evernote</a> notebook.

If there's some important document, I scan it directly into Evernote using a Canon ScanSnap sheet-fed scanner, that's also portable. (Amazon UK <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-S1300-Document-Scanner/dp/B0038N4OA8/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1330597701&sr=1-1"">link</a>)

It'll handle everything from colour A4 documents to double-sided business cards.
That scanner can also save its scan files somewhere, so I direct them to a <a href=""http://www.dropbox.com/"">Dropbox</a> folder. That means I've backed everything up 'in the cloud' as well as on my computer, plus it's indexed and available in Evernote - which (through the use of Dark Magic, also OCRs the words and lets me search for text among my scanned paperwork).

Evernote (and Dropbox) also have apps for iPhones (and I assume other smartphones too) so that I could check whether I paid my TV licence or applied for a new tax disc as the thought occurs to me, not just when I'm at my desk. I could even call up a scan of something important like my travel insurance policy when I'm a few thousand miles from my paperwork.

The point of all this is not just to waste money while getting organised; it's also to lower the psychological barrier to getting on with admin. It takes into account the advice that you shouldn't have a To Do list, because that's daunting, you should have a Have Done list, where you record your achievements. Well, my filing system of catalogued and ruthlessly organised records is a visual reminder of where all those boring hours went: they went into building a shrine to Completed Admin, a life-sized monument to Being On Top Of Things. And that's very comforting, even on days when I walk past it with no intention of opening a single letter. It reminds me that as <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Feel-Fear-Anyway-Susan-Jeffers/dp/0712671056"">Susan Jeffers</a> so nearly said, you can Feel The Boredom And Do It Anyway.

Just a word or too about that <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2012/03/stationery_tarts_and_productiv.html#comments"">last post</a> of mine where I give every appearance of being someone who lines up their peas into grids before eating them and afterwards records the fact in a Moleskine notebook*. If true, then it's worth saying that this was not always the case. As a child I was perpetually forgetting to do things. I was reasonably good at maths in school, but used to get low marks because I'd always make what my teachers called a 'silly slip'. My early attempts at writing programs tended to fail for the same reason: I knew the theory but what I'd written was not quite what I thought I'd written. When I was a bit older I had a car that I tinkered with and I tended to rush into repairs or upgrades to it without planning them properly, without making a note of where all the bits went and then get bored before the job was finished.

But I suppose I was somewhere in the middle of the spectrum between spontaneous and free-thinking at one end and rigid and obsessive at the other. Or to reverse the pejoratives there: between chaotic and completely organised.

In my early twenties I worked on what bosses called my 'lack of attention to detail' until my code compiled and my equations balanced and I rarely forgot to do something important. I knew I was getting somewhere when people started to criticise me not for being slapdash but for being a 'neat freak'. Me?","And the further I've tried to push myself towards the OCD, anal-retentive end of the spectrum, the more rewards it's yielded. Because the fact is that details usually matter, and if you don't attend to them you're denied the great pleasure of really getting things right. Painstaking organisation still doesn't come naturally to me, but these days I don't mind the struggle.

In my consultancy days, my determination to get good at the details led to me being called an 'idealist' or 'unrealistic'  - even 'uncommercial' - but as I've suggested elsewhere on this blog, all the really cool stuff in business <em>is</em> idealistic. Everything else is plagiarism. 

I've started to think that 'normal' on the chaotic/obsessive spectrum is too far towards the chaotic end. We encourage people to be 'spontaneous' as though that wasn't going to happen anyway. We're all impulsive; it's being organised that needs work. And there actually isn't even a dichotomy between creativity and order: the artists I admire most have more inspiration than they know what to do with, but they pursue that inspiration with the dogged rigour of the perfectionist.

So if you read that <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2012/03/stationery_tarts_and_productiv.html#comments"">last post</a> thinking that I might well have a problem with my obsessive attention to detail and my fixation with order and neatness, I do. But it's the opposite problem to the one you might think.

Of course we can share paper books, and that's not generally considered to be a wicked thing, but then you can't share your book with a million others at once. Although libraries do their best - and are not usually condemned for it. That said, it does seem to me that the DRM on books is protecting us against a theoretical problem and not (yet) a real one. And those book locks come at a considerable price in terms of hassle and complexity.

And perhaps more importantly, those locks also keep customers coming back to the same retailer. Amazon might be worried about piracy when they tie their e-books to Kindles and nothing else, but it certainly doesn't hurt customer loyalty either. There's no way to take your library to another platform if you no longer favour Amazon.","When it comes to piracy, I always like to go back to the idea of playing music on the radio. You're giving it away for free to millions (billions?) of people and yet the most lucrative music is often the music that is given away (i.e. played on the radio) the most. Music labels beg and cajole radio stations to play their tracks more not less. There's clearly a trade-off: letting the product circulate without too many restrictions builds the market; sales follow. Being too 'grabby' and refusing to let a song ever be played for free would just guarantee that it was too obscure to sell much. But does that thinking carry over into books, when we don't tend to read a book ten times in the way we might listen to a track we like? If you let a customer have a freebie, haven't you blown that sale for good? So perhaps there isn't a strong analogy there but it's certainly true that 'obscurity not piracy' is the current big problem when you're launching a book so might some loosening of the strings be a good thing?

O'Reilly do some very loosey-goosey things with their e-books. With a single purchase you get the book in several e-book formats with no DRM (<a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/category/customer-service/ebooks.do"">link</a>). In theory you could just e-mail it out to everyone you know. But O'Reilly don't seem to have suffered that fate despite their readership being super tech-savvy about file-sharing, neither do they appear to have been stung by their trusting approach which has been around for a while now.

And that lack of hassle and DRM makes O'Reilly books really appealing. You can cut-and-paste from them and even print them out. If you happen to want the book as a mundane, DRM-free PDF that you can read on pretty much anything with a screen it's available. That (so far) seems to be much more of a lure to honest customers wanting a hassle-free life (= sales up) than to rapacious pirates (=sales down). 

So just as a thought experiment, what do we all think would happen if we took all the locks off e-books and developed a universal format that would work on all readers and in all reader apps? What if we did everything we could to popularise books without fear of piracy and trusted that it would work? The result: an explosion in reading and a boost to sales? Or an implosion in profit as previously law-abiding readers go feral?

And are we being short-sighted here: if a big part of the future of publishing is e-books, is it foolish to lock up our books for fear of piracy, which isn't a huge problem yet, while doing very little about the fact that monopolies are developing in the book world (=Amazon) that pose an existential threat to bookshops and traditional publishing? In fact, fear of piracy can play right into Amazon's hands by making it impossible to move your library away from Amazon no matter what happens. 

I mean, if I wanted to be histrionic about it I could compare it to a protection racket. Amazon protects us from the scary, imaginary pirates in exchange for a cut of everyone's profits. And you can't really opt out if you want your business to thrive. I'm not saying Amazon think in those terms, I'm just saying that however good their intentions, the mechanics of the system would be familiar to any mafioso - even if the only knee-capping is commercial not physical. I hope our fear of book terrorists doesn't mean we voluntarily give up all control of our industry to the people offering to protect us from the bogeyman.","","","","2012-03-07","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","2"

I thought I'd pick up something I forgot to mention when talking about locks (=<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management"">DRM</a>) on e-books the <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2012/03/locks_on_books.html"">other day</a>. Let me just share with you the quote from Alan Baker that reminded me of the point I want to make: <code>""Interesting comment in your piece: ""letting the product circulate without too many restrictions builds the market; sales follow"". There's some evidence to support this from Neil Gaiman (no less). I can't remember where I read it (probably on his blog), but he said that when one of his books was pirated and shared for free in a certain territory (I think it was Russia), subsequent sales of that book increased dramatically.

Not exactly proof of concept, of course, but interesting; and it can be contrasted with the attitude taken by writers like Harlan Ellison, who says that his work belongs to him and no one else, and that if he wants to give it away for free on the internet, that should be his decision and no one else's.""</code>

On the one hand, the 'piracy = advertising' idea is fascinating. Because if we were to think of piracy as just one form of 'giving it away for free', the entertainment industry's anger on this subject becomes just a little less justified. They're always trying to create buzz - and that's difficult if you don't throw around the content in public for people to see. They'd like to control that content, of course, but that's not to say piracy doesn't sometimes generate interest which translates into legit sales.

But Alan's mention of Harlan Ellison was what I wanted to pick up. I'm very familiar with authors insisting that their property is their property, end of discussion. But what they never seem to do is offer to pay for their rights to be enforced around the world.","Of course a right is a right regardless of whether you have the cash to make it a reality, but those in favour of strict copyright rarely seem to mention the cost of enforcement, as though the rest of us should just be happy to chip in on their behalf. And of course if we are expected to pay for the copyright police we generally want to know what's in it for us. And I think that's what constitutes the opposing force on copyright: when copyright is so strict that it fails to benefit non-authors, why should we pay to enforce it? Shouldn't those who profit from enforcement pay the majority of those bills? Harlan Ellison (to put words into his mouth) is offering us very little in return for the loan of our police force and judiciary to ensure no one reads a book of his without permission. But shouldn't we get something out of the deal? The idea that we'll protect your work while you're alive if you effectively leave it to us all in your will sounds quite sensible to me. But the idea that copyright might extend seventy years or more past the author's death sounds like something else is going on besides a sensible contract between originator and enforcer. I suspect it's the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentier_capitalism"">rentier</a> mentality of the middleman at work, but it probably gets some support from hardline copyright fans who are authors who view their rights in terms of abstract entitlements and not real-world policing efforts.

And that's not a small consideration. The recent attempts to got SOPA/PIPA passed in the U.S. were going to seriously inconvenience millions of people in order to protect Hollywood's copyright - and the only cash they were willing to cough up was what they pay in campaign contributions and  presumably (don't-quote-me) fat bribes.

Anyway, I would like to conclude with failed pomposity by mangling the following latin phrase: ""Quis merciet ipsos custodes?"" which may or may not mean, ""Who recompenses the guards?""","","","","2012-03-10","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","5"

The internet is probably full of articles on this point, but I happen not to have tripped over any, so I thought I'd share. When a YouTube video or a cute picture or a new craze spreads not via mainstream marketing campaigns or television masts broadcasting identical ads into every home, but instead by humans telling the other humans they know, we say that the spread has 'gone viral'. 'Virus', as you probably know, comes from a word meaning 'poison' and shares a root with the word 'vile'. Directly translated, it means 'ooky'. It suggests the mindless spread of something unhealthy. 'Virus' also has another meaning in modern times: a virus is something that takes over the orderly operation of a system and compromises or hijacks its behaviour.  I can understand why 'viral' would be <u>one</u> of the ways we might describe the non-centralised spread of something through the population, but why we would settle on a word with such negative connotations I can't imagine (or rather I can). Surely only people thoroughly steeped in the one-to-many, mainstream 'broadcast' model of marketing could label the act of telling your friends about something as both a malfunction and an unhealthy process. 

It is, I suspect, far too late to relabel this process, but maybe there's occasionally scope to say that something is 'spreading organically' instead of 'virally' ('organic' suggesting living things plus a healthy lack of processing or additives). I could even make a case for a term like 'naturally'. And I suppose we're groping our way in that direction by talking about 'social networking' the whole time. We don't have a handy phrase for 'it spread in a social-network-y way', but maybe that's what the term 'socially' will come to mean in a few years' time.","The reason I think the terminology is worth thinking about is that when information spreads from person to person, based on friendship and individual judgement, there are a lot of advantages over the 'broadcast' model. And we don't want to give something wholesome a name that suggests it's to be discouraged. The 'broadcast' model will give you Britney Spears or Boyzone; organic connections will give you a cool, local band you can actually get in to see on a Friday night. 'Broadcast' will give you top-selling novels everyone's read and no one really cares about; 'organic' will give you genre hits and cult classics and actual excitement and passion for the material. I'm talking about the difference between reading a literary review of an 'important' book and hearing a friend rave about how they stayed up until 2:30am turning pages. Yes, sometimes 'broadcast' hits the bullseye, but - to take one example - two weeks ago (for the first time as far as I'm aware) the website <a href=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/"">RottentTomatoes</a> which collects hundreds of movie reviews about each new release had scored every film in the U.S. top-ten as 'rotten'.

Even more importantly, the pathways that 'organic' information travel along are also the connections that build a community. Every time something flows across those wires it either strengthens or weakens the bonds - weakens if the info is a turn-off, strengthens if it hits the spot. And this network, unlike the 'broadcast' marketing model, is much better at fine-tuning itself. ""Dude*,"" you would say to a friend, ""enough with the lolcats. When is your brother's band next playing?""

We're moving towards a world in which 'organic' connections are back at the heart of communication, just as they were in every century before the Twentieth. We still need a parallel, centralised way of sharing information to help stop communities turning into cults, crazy cliques or mobs, but I've often wondered what would happen in a world where, say, the Yellow Pages had never existed and when we wanted a plumber or electrician, the rule was that we had to ask our friends for a recommendation. That would be a world where 'cowboys' didn't last long.

So, if you get a chance, maybe you could think about saying that something spread 'socially' rather than 'virally' just in case it makes a difference. If nothing else it will remind you that 'talking to friends' is normal and it's being bombarded by information from corporations that's potentially unhealthy. Fortunately we now live in a bizarre age where 'talking to friends' is seen as the next big thing.

Emma and I like visiting our printers. Currently that's <a href=""http://cpibooks.com/uk/"">CPI</a> and we had great fun having a really good look around their Chippenham site recently. Even though we're a small customer, whenever we visit any printers we always have a fuss made of us, they always seem glad to see us and we always learn so much. And that was certainly true of CPI. 

Even if there were no good commercial reason for gawping at all the machinery, it's still enormous fun to see a monstrous drum of 'web' paper weighing a couple of tons feeding some gigantic Heidelberg press and then follow the printed web until it becomes stacks of cut sections on a conveyor belt. And from there watching those stacks have their backs glued and their covers fitted - until they're all trimmed up, finding their way onto pallets, where they're shrink-wrapped ready for loading on a truck. On one side of the warehouse are big drums of paper; on the other side are stacks of books ready for the store. Every publisher should watch that process happen if they get the chance.

So that's the fun tourist-y part of the visit. But there's always a commercial benefit to a printer visit. We don't know what it will be in advance but we always come away with exciting ideas for the future. Sometimes it's new processes we could use: CPI have a machine (well, several actually, within the group) about the size and shape of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sg1stargatefront.jpg"">Stargate</a> - called an <a href=""http://h10088.www1.hp.com/cda/gap/display/main/index.jsp?zn=gap&cp=20000-13698-25954-27038-27584^345951_4041_100__"">HP T350</a> - that will print around 600 feet a minute of hi-res, full-colour content on uncoated paper up to about A4 size. And because the whole thing is digital, you can mix and match different content within your print run. Print 706 copies of one title and 1 of another. Or customise each of those 706 copies to have a different reader's name on the title page. Cool, right?","<div class=""pic""><img alt=""T350Output.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/T350Output.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""320"" /><p>T350 output</p></div>

Paired with the T350, but looking slightly less like salvaged alien tech, is an <a href=""http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/18972-18972-236257-90275-3638783-4169553.html?dnr=1"">HP Indigo 7500</a> for printing the covers. It's fabulous, but you have to live without the usual cover treatments: no matt lams or foils or spot UV. You get a very nice glossy finish, but personally, I think CPI should work out how to combine litho-printed covers with the pages from the T350. It would be a headache, but it would also allow them to compete with all the benefits of 4-colour litho and yet be economical on a 500 unit print-run (or smaller if you combine a few of your tiny print-runs into one big one).

Another benefit of visiting printers is having them talk about their problems. That may not seem like either a fun or a useful thing, but get them to open up about what causes them headaches and you're in a position to do a deal. I don't want to go into loads of details just in case you steal all our cunning ideas, but we talked with one team about waste and how we could reduce that waste by specifying our print jobs in a way that's complementary to how they work. We talked to another team about rejigging our scheduling of jobs to save them money. And we talked with a third team about being guinea-pigs for their new software system and then acting as a reference site when they want to roll it out. The first two of those ideas involved saving CPI money: that's good because if it all pans out, we can ask for a share of that saved money knocked off our future bills. The third is about helping them with their future plans and the quid pro quo will be that we are on great terms with all the key staff and we're making use of their latest services while other publishers are still dithering.

Of course all of this relies on you really understanding the nitty-gritty of your own print needs and a fair amount about the technology of printing. If you outsource all your cover designs, your typesetting, the buying of your print jobs and have very little interest in what happens to your print-ready PDFs once they leave your computer then all you might get out of a printer visit is a look at some cool machinery (and very probably a nice pub lunch too). But if you've already rolled up your sleeves and investigated every part of your own business, then doing a little of the same with a printers will almost certainly pay dividends. Help them take costs out of their part of the supply chain and they can often help you take cost out of yours. Learn the best and latest ways of working and you'll give your firm an edge that others don't have. And persuade your printers to tell you what causes them the most headaches when dealing with publishers and you can make sure your firm isn't causing your printers - and yourselves - avoidable delays and unnecessary costs.

And did I say it's fun?","","","","2012-03-15","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

It's about why the ideas for really big revolutions in the tech world are repellent rather than attractive. To pr&eacute;cis: if they're big enough to change the world they'd be a terrifying responsibility to take on. It's a cute observation, but the author, Paul Graham, goes on to do a great job of explaining how you need to view the world if you want to achieve really significant change. It left me wondering what the equivalent mega-innovations might be for the world of books: you know, real departures in our thinking that would lead the way to the future.

I should warn you: I'm going to talk about politics. And that's not everyone's cup of tea. I think a lot of people like to leave politics to the politicians. We print the books; they run the world. Division of labour. Stick to what you know. It makes sense. Except that every now and again I think we wonder if they're holding up their end of the bargain. You glance up from your work and catch sight of a news article which mentions that the economy is bankrupt but the City is booming and you wonder how that happened. Because just a couple of years ago it was the other way round. Surely the politicians didn't just <em>give</em> all of our money to the banks, did they? I mean they wouldn't do that, would they? Because we'd never stand for it. Unless we already did. 

When it comes to trusting those in charge, the problem is that there are some strong temptations in the world of politics. In our world, we're surrounded by books and about the worst thing we might get tempted to do is sneak a couple of copies home. But when you're surrounded by money and power and nuclear launch codes and billionaires wanting favours and foreign leaders proposing alliances and the head of the armed forces wondering where you want your aircraft carriers to be deployed next, the whole thing can go to your head.","Plus, as a politician, you can easily fall in with a bad crowd. I suspect a lot of elected leaders meet two sorts of people. Type One are very rich, very powerful, very focussed and very persuasive people who say, ""Support me and I'll make this country wealthy and successful. And when you retire I might even make you wealthy and successful too."" Many of these people own newspapers or TV companies or run business empires that stretch halfway round the world, or provide the donations that a politician needs to get re-elected. And politicians also meet people of Type Two who are... everyone else. They aren't rich or powerful or focussed or persuasive and they don't know what they want. In fact they are totally inconsequential except for the fact that they vote occasionally. But even when they vote they do so in a sort of misinformed haze with their minds on other things. Clearly they're a low priority but one still needs to keep half an eye on them. Which is why I think most politicians end up doing the following: working hard to please Type One people without making such a mess that the muddled mass of Type Two people actually notices and takes an interest.

I would say that the Noughties ran exactly along those lines. For corporate interests, and for the fabulously wealthy, it was a boom time. For everyone else there was a slow, subtle <a href=""http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/income-inequality-in-america-chart-graph"">squeeze</a>, so that most people hardly noticed their living standards were actually slipping slightly instead of rising. We tightened up the rules on what ordinary citizens could do, and we loosened the rules on what companies could do and until the financial crisis hit the whole thing seemed to work. Type One people were very happy with their <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/mar/01/lord-ashcroft-what-is-a-non-dom"">non-dom</a> status and <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/oct/23/tax-dodging-goldman-sachs-greece"">tax exemptions</a> for their businesses. And Type Two people were busy printing books or watching Escape to the Country and didn't notice.

But it's getting more and more difficult not to notice. In all other areas of our life we can find out everything about everything with almost no effort. If I want to find out when the last dodo died, I bet I can do so in less than 10 seconds. Go! OK, it took six seconds because apparently it's a complicated question (but let's say 1662 for now). 

And not only is it easy to find anything out if you have an internet connection, it's easy to spread the word and to give feedback... except in one area of our lives: politics. Consider the fact that you can hardly visit a corporate website without being asked to provide feedback on how the service could be improved, whether the help documents answered your question, whether you're satisfied with the product and how you rate the company's performance. We all know it's easy to connect the customer to the company. But when it comes to politics, governments have to pretend it's still 1970 and pray that we don't notice that the internet connects to Whitehall as well as the West End.

Listen to any politician promoting a war and you'll hear an outpouring of pseudo-earnest rhapsodising on the subject of how much they love democracy. It's their favourite thing, they dream about it and they just can't rest until it's been made available - at gunpoint if necessary - to every oppressed foreigner in every oil-rich nation in the world. But how much effort do politicians put into promoting democracy at home? None. Less than none. They are, in fact, largely against it. A truly democracy-loving nation would probably institute <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebiscite"">plebiscites</a> or mini-referendums on a regular basis. And it would make it easier for concerned citizens to communicate their thoughts to those in power. But as the internet has connected ordinary people to each other and to businesses, there's been a mysterious lack of 'take up' in the halls of power. In fact, we've clamped down on anyone who's politically active (and who isn't a billionaire). The police and MI5 <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/12/second-undercover-police-officer-unmasked?INTCMP=SRCH"">infiltrate</a> activist groups, even if they're pacifists, they install <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-17116526"">CCTV</a> in every corner of every public space and they <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/dec/26/student-protester-stroked-police-horse?INTCMP=SRCH"">arrest</a> those who march through the streets. 

Protest is welcomed provided it's civil and orderly, not too inconvenient, and all its permits are in order. In other words, you are allowed to protest provided you do so in a way that no one will notice.

Well, this week I am reading that the UK government is thinking it will give a <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/mar/17/budget-2012-nick-clegg"">tax break</a> to the well-off, while pushing ahead with its plan to axe <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15907858"">half a million</a> public sector jobs. It is gearing up to start privatising the NHS (<a href=""http://www.allysonpollock.co.uk/administrator/components/com_article/attach/2012-03-08/BMJ_2012_Pollock_HealthSocialCareBill.pdf"">PDF</a> from the BMJ) and it's refusing to acknowledge that its <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/11/cameron-and-the-confidence-fairy-an-update/"">austerity policies</a> are damaging the economy while ignoring mainstream economic thinking about how to get out of a recession.

And the only way for this sort of nonsense to continue, where politicians pay lip service to voters while cutting the legs out from under them, is if we all continue failing to notice just how easy it is to become well-informed about what's going on. That thin meniscus behind which all the grubby deals take place is like a soap bubble that's about to pop. As Wikileaks shovel millions of pages of damning disclosures into the public domain, the amount of effort involved in becoming an 'activist' falls. One well-placed Google search and you're suddenly a member of the resistance.

So my prediction? I think 2012 will be the year that the soap bubble pops and we all find ourselves with an interest in politics again. Because it's easy, because it matters, because we're watching our interests sacrificed right before our eyes and it's actually starting to get difficult to ignore it. It's like we're trying to pay attention to Celebrity Come Dancing while burglars carry our valuables out to their van, and sometimes they block the screen and we have to crane our necks to keep watching the program. I think 2012 will be the year that a lot of people undergo the realisation that the boring stuff they've been leaving to the politicians is actually what they care about most in the world.","","","","2012-03-18","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

Professor Brian Cox points out (in this interesting little <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/9707209.stm"">interview</a> for the BBC) that with those cash reserves Apple could pay for the entire UK science budget for 25 years. He hardly needs to spell out how many breakthroughs the last 25 years have produced that more than pay their way - and several have totally changed the world.

So what did Apple decide to do? They basically admitted they hadn't got any really good ideas and so they plan to give at least half the money back to their shareholders. And this is a company that hasn't paid dividends for 17 years. Yes, their investors are baying for a pay-out, but they'd be idiots to stand in the way if Apple had more ideas up their sleeve like the iPad, iPhone, iPod or Mac computing line - because ideas like that multiply their initial investment many times over. Personally, I'm enormously disappointed that Apple can't think of a case to make for spending that money on their future.","","","","","2012-03-21","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

There's a <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/mar/20/novelists-plead-poverty-after-hollywood"">little piece in the paper</a> today about Susan Hill, author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Woman-Black-Susan-Hill/dp/0099562979/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1332315577&sr=8-2"">The Woman in Black</a>, and how rich she <em>isn't</em>. I admit I've been guilty of assuming <a href=""http://www.susan-hill.com/"">Susan</a> must be rolling in money given that the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596365/"">movie</a> of her book has grossed over $100m (or has it? More on that in a moment). Obviously I should have known better. After all, I have read: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Hollywood-Economist-2-0-Financial/dp/1612190502/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1332312053&sr=8-2"">The Hollywood Economist 2.0: The Hidden Financial Reality Behind the Movies</a>. It's full of tales of high-grossing movies financially engineered so that they can make plenty of cash but no 'profit'. 

Hollywood's trick is to take all the people they want to give money to and count their share of the cake as an expense. Then they offer to pay all the people they're not crazy about out of eventual 'profits' once the movie has hit its 'breakeven'. But that 'breakeven' doesn't happen until that first group of people have had their fill - and that can take decades, if it ever happens at all. Hollywood accountants also make sure that every other possible cost that could be associated with a movie is also paid off before the people with a share of the 'net profits' get a penny. And if there are some people they want to screw more than others they can vary their definitions of 'breakeven' depending on who they're negotiating with. NB: authors are almost never people Hollywood is eager to be generous with unless they're really 'connected' or on a winning streak at the box office.
<div class=""pic""><a href=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_woman_in_black_2011/""><img alt=""WomanInBlackPoster.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/WomanInBlackPoster.jpg"" width=""260"" height=""198"" /></a></div>

Now let's have a quick think about that figure of $100m that the Woman in Black has supposedly 'grossed'. That would be total 'box office receipts', meaning the total amount charged for cinema tickets. Well, half of that money stays with the cinema. And then maybe 15% of what's left goes to the film distributor (who likes to overcharge for 'prints' of the movie). So straightaway the movie's coffers are only receiving $42.5m. The Woman in Black's budget is supposedly a very low-sounding $17m (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596365/business"">source</a>) but the average amount spent on advertising a nationwide movie in the U.S. is more than that (even back in 1997 the average was $19m). So if we guess an ad budget of $25m, the movie is now half a million dollars in the red.","Of course, Hollywood studios make their money back with 'output deals' where they sell a package of their movies to TV and cable companies. And if all goes well, they also make a lot of 'back end' money on DVDs. And they work hard on merchandising and tie-ins. But it's quite possible that Susan doesn't get a share of any of that income because just as Hollywood accounting likes to lump every cost it can find in before it declares 'breakeven' it also likes to leave lots of revenue out.

Hollywood doesn't do all of this just to screw authors - it's also trying to avoid paying taxes. Preventing authors getting rich is just a happy side-effect (despite the fact that, as that article points out, 5 of the 9 films nominated for Oscars last year were adaptations of books).

So while the movie will carry on bringing in money for the studio on TV and DVD for years to come, Susan may only be entitled to a share of the 'profit' it makes in cinemas, where the revenue will peter out completely after a few months. And that's if Susan was lucky enough to get a sensible share of the 'net profits'. If she was offered, say, 2% of some 'net net net profit' figure, even a movie that did much better than expected could conceivably never pay out. Susan may only ever get whatever sum she signed over the movie rights for. Which had it been an unknown book could be as little as a thousand pounds. Hopefully Susan got much more than that, but it won't be pink-cadillacs-and-champagne-for-breakfast money.

If she'd insisted on writing the first treatment of the screenplay - which may or may not have been a) something she could have negotiated or b) something she wanted to attempt - she might have broken into six figures rather than the more normal five-figures for plain old 'movie rights' on a popular book. 

My understanding is that the only way for Susan to really make money from the Woman in Black would be to have a rip-roaring sequel ready to go - and then hold it to ransom for a fat up-front payment and a 'share of the gross' including international markets and 'back end' licencing.

In other words: it's very difficult for an author to make serious money (i.e. more than a hundred thousand pounds) from even a blockbuster movie unless they sold the rights <u>after</u> their box-office track record was already established. And they had a lawyer who really knows Hollywood.","","","","2012-03-21","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

So I know how *we* make ebooks for Amazon (as you'd hope). I was wondering, though - how do *you* do it? 

We make our own ebooks, from their typesetting files in InDesign CS 5.5. We use the Kindle InDesign plugin that Rob's mentioned before, which helps a bit, to create the Mobi file, along with a lot of custom macros. If you want, I can write them up. Then we upload said file, along with an ONIX message and the cover design measuring no less than 500px wide, to the Mobipocket FTP site. From there, I follow a series of not very obvious links to get the files from the upload folder (which is a mobipocket site, but which is called ebookbase.com, to my endless confusion) to the 'import cabinet' (more confusion) and thence live onto the interweb for to be vended.","We also use an XMP export from our bibliographic data whatsit system so I don't have to laboriously type in the title, author, isbn, pub date etc. (It would take all of 8 seconds, but it's the principle, people, the principle. Plus a person, such as me, can make a lot of mistakes in 8 seconds.) 

I'm interested, though. If you're a publisher, do you upload things to Mobipocket yourself, or do you get a man in to do that? Do you upload single-title ONIX messages? Or what? Do tell!","","","","2012-03-22","2013-03-29","","","","Emma","7"

Have you noticed how much the topics of privacy, secrecy, surveillance, leaks, spying, censorship and the role played by social media in uprisings have been in the news lately? Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria and Yemen have pitted their ability to censor criticism and suppress online dissent against the ability of disgruntled citizens to share what they know and what they plan to do about it. 

And yet if you were to attend a conference of bleeding-edge security experts like, say, the <a href=""http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/wiki/Welcome"">Chaos Communication Congress</a> (CCC) in Berlin, you might be horrified to find just how insecure all modern communication is. (Note: CCC is the kind of conference that's full of brilliant girls and guys with piercings and tattoos who know what they're talking about, not the kind with guys in suits offering to sell you a new firewall-in-a-box.) 

Even if you're not that technically-minded you might like to scare yourself a little by watching one of CCC's presentations on, say, how easy it is for someone to clone your mobile phone's ID as you walk down the street, and then to intercept your calls or pretend to be you (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWdHSJsEOck"">link</a>). Police forces routinely track citizens via their mobiles - and in some places they set up their own <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSI-catcher"">temporary cell phone towers</a> to give them greater access - which extends not just to the supposed bad guy's communications, but everyone whose phone is captured by that tower. At home that's troubling, in some parts of the world you'd have no way of knowing whether your calls home or to your office were now a matter of record at the local Ministry of Truth.","Elsewhere in the CCC archives you could find out about the newly discovered vulnerability of HP printers. Everyone has a big old LaserJet in their office but until recently no one really thought about the fact that each one was in a effect a little computer on their network, with no anti-virus software and no firewall, no password required or monitoring in place, doing pretty much whatever it was told by anyone on the LAN. That's vaguely worrying, but it becomes seriously troubling when you look at how easy it is to secretly change the firmware that runs on those printers. For eminently practical reasons from a simpler time, HP lets you just send a special print job to the printer in order to upgrade the software it's running - and it doesn't mind much where that print job comes from. So imagine someone sends in a job application to a big firm and includes a copy of their CV attached to which is a malicious firmware upgrade hidden in the same file. The HR department prints out the CV and now their printer is running hacked software. That printer can now call out through their firewall (much easier than getting in from the outside) and act as a relay for whatever an attacker wants to get up to on the company's network. Farfetched, you might say, but you can watch a demo of it in action right <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njVv7J2azY8"">here</a>.

In repressive regimes we see the other side of the coin. There are a number of Western firms who use their knowledge of network vulnerabilities to make surveillance equipment which then ends up in the hands of dictatorships where it's used to <a href=""http://owni.eu/2011/12/01/spyfiles-wikileaks-revelations-of-mass-internet-surveillance/"">spy on restless citizens</a>. Sometimes the manufacturer's excuse is that they sold the equipment to third-parties who then sold it on; at other times no excuse is offered. But you can imagine how dispiriting it is for, say, Syrian activists to read President Obama's words that ""<code>...what the Syrian regime is doing is unacceptable.</code>"" (<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/on-syria-obama-defends-his-decision-not-to-intervene/2012/03/14/gIQAxSjwCS_story.html"">source</a>) and then to discover the equipment that's used to spy on and capture them is made in California (<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424052970203687504577001911398596328-lMyQjAxMTAxMDIwODEyNDgyWj.html"">source</a>).

And it's not just those who live under dictatorships who have to worry; so do those who simply want to report on them. Western journalists can get to almost any trouble-spot on the planet these days and they can file stories with their editors back home over satellite phones that will work almost anywhere. But it turns out - you won't be surprised to hear - that many of those satellite phones are totally insecure. Some even broadcast the user's exact GPS location in an unencrypted transmission that can be intercepted by someone with the right equipment. Which is <a href=""https://safermobile.org/be-afraid-be-very-afraid-of-satellite-phones-in-insecure-locations/"">probably how</a> awesome veteran journalist Marie Colvin and her colleague R&eacute;mi Ochlik of the Sunday Times came to be killed a few weeks ago in Syria: the Syrian Army knew exactly where they were phoning in their revealing reports from.

We live in a world where some innocent-seeming decision that some programmer took about where to store a piece of data resulted - indirectly - in two journalists being blown to bits. When you trust your life to technology the tiniest technical details matter - and most of us know nothing about that.

The list of countries who still don't choose their leaders in free elections is a long one - and it's likely that most of them put a lot of effort into spying on those citizens who are most likely to push for democracy. Helping those who are prepared to risk their lives so that their community can live free is clearly something we want to support. And I personally think there are better ways to do that than by invading the country in question.
<div class=""pic""><a href=""https://www.torproject.org/""><img alt=""TORLogo.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/TORLogo.jpg"" width=""88"" height=""128"" /></a></div>

One such way is to support the <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/"">TOR Project</a>. They make The Onion Router (=TOR) which is nothing to do with the satirical magazine The Onion and everything to do with letting oppressed citizens use the web without every word they type ending up in an intelligence dossier somewhere. By disguising web traffic and bouncing page requests between multiple 'relay nodes', TOR makes it difficult for repressive authorities to identify those they would most like to 'disappear'. If you want a really fascinating and rather moving account of the cat-and-mouse game played between the TOR architects and the dictatorships keen to break through TOR's protection so that they can get their hands on the activists it hides, then go <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwMr8Xl7JMQ"">here</a>.

You can <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en"">donate</a> to TOR, you can <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en"">run a TOR node</a> to help others use the web in safety, or you can <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en"">download</a> a copy for yourself. Even if you don't think the government are spying on you, a simple thing like placing an Amazon order while you're using the WiFi in some random coffee shop could leave your credit card details in the wrong hands. TOR can keep you safe (though there are some gotchas you must avoid - details <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en#Warning"">here</a>).

TOR always has the problem that the channels they are trying to protect run over the public internet. It's a constant battle to hide vulnerable users when a repressive authority owns the physical infrastructure. That's part of why another project, the <a href=""http://briar.sourceforge.net/overview.html"">Briar</a> initiative, has come into being. They're developing tools to help democracy activists in un-democratic places use secure local connections to talk to each other while keeping Big Brother out of the loop. By making local links between laptops and smartphones, which make use of chains of trust among activists, those in danger of a visit from the secret police can keep many of their most sensitive communications off the internet altogether. 

It's not difficult for me to imagine a single project like TOR or Briar changing the world for the better beyond anything an invasion, diplomacy or embargoes can achieve. After all, dictators always enjoy minority support - otherwise they wouldn't need to be dictators. They stay in power by stopping their opponents from organising (or from drawing breath in many cases). Technology like TOR's, and soon Briar's, can help to give the majority their power back. 

Briar are currently looking for funding from the <a href=""http://newschallenge.tumblr.com/post/19480700983/briar-a-secure-news-and-discussion-system"">Knight News Challenge</a>, and I really hope their project is chosen.

Without getting on my high horse about it, the recent U.S. invasions have cost $3 trillion (<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/07/AR2008030702846.html"">source</a>) and left two countries in ruins. A few hundred thousand dollars to support the right projects could bring about much better outcomes by helping countries in similar situations rescue <em>themselves</em>. That's value for money.","","","","2012-03-23","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

I've just been reading some of the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/28/verdict-uk-riots-stake-society"">conclusions</a> about the UK riots of last year.","I imagine responses to the report will be a lot like the responses to the riots themselves. Some people will feel that we need to be harder on rioters and potential rioters. They have to be punished harder to deter any future public disorder.

Whereas the report itself seems to lean more towards the idea that people without a solid stake in society, who have very little to lose, are most likely to attack that society. Or put another way, society itself has let too many people get to the point where they say, ""Why not?"" That finding chimes with my personal feelings, and I have to say, in terms of what's happened in the last couple of years, it still feels like we're moving very much in the wrong direction. Because of what the banks did, we're eliminating jobs for young people, then we're eliminating benefits, we're cutting back on many of the programs that might support them and we're hoping that threats of increasingly harsh punishment will keep them in line. You couldn't make young, poor people feel less wanted if you tried. We don't care about them and we won't help them, but woe betide them if they treat us with the same disdain.

And this last budget underlined the point. No matter how grim things are, we can <em>always</em> find a way to <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/27/osborne-defends-top-tax-cut?INTCMP=SRCH"">cut taxes for the rich</a>. But (apparently) there simply is no way to offer anything to the poor except stiffer sentences if they do something anti-social. We can find money for the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/mar/09/olympic-games-budget-cost?INTCMP=SRCH"">Olympics</a>. We can find money to protect ourselves from the threat of Afghan horsemen menacing the shores of Britain. We can afford an 'independent' <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/21/trident-nuclear-missiles-savings?INTCMP=SRCH"">nuclear deterrent</a> (which only the Americans have the keys to). But support for young people facing a bleak future is considered an unaffordable luxury.

And obviously I don't know what's going on inside the heads of rioters, but I can't help feeling that part of their problem is that they don't believe those at the top are actually playing by the rules. In terms of devastation to the country, the financial crisis dwarfs the riots: so where are the calls for draconian deterrents to prevent another credit meltdown? Shouldn't we be locking these people up and kicking their families out of their homes to send a message to future would-be ransackers of the financial economy? The answer appears to be 'no'. You have to assume that a different set of rules apply when rich people threaten society. None of which excuses rioting, but I'd feel much less disgusted about locking someone up for <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8695988/London-riots-Lidl-water-thief-jailed-for-six-months.html"">stealing some bottles of water</a> if recklessly gambling away a billion pounds of other people's money was also vehemently discouraged - and by 'vehemently discouraged' I don't mean <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16824197"">taking away someone's knighthood</a>.

If we want to make potential rioters feel like we're all in this together we can't excuse the rich and jail the poor, and we can't bail out the rich and squeeze the poor. Doing those things is how you force people to riot, not how you prevent it.","","","","2012-03-28","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","0"

"42621","","1","Website outage and DNS explained","Publish","true","<div class=""pic""><img alt=""DomainNameSpace.jpg"" src=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/DomainNameSpace.jpg"" width=""260"" height=""209"" /></div>

The Snowbooks website was unavailable for a few hours early this morning and it seems that it was my fault. Many apologies to our authors and those who tried to visit our site. I screwed up some 'DNS' settings and mayhem/confusion ensued.

As well as an apology I thought I'd use this as a 'learning opportunity' and explain what DNS is and why you need to know about it if you want to administer a website. Then, if you're interested, you can read about what it was I actually did wrong.","So, first of all you need to know how the data whizzing backwards and forwards to a website like the one at snowbooks.com finds its way there. Much of the internet uses something called IP, which stands for Internet Protocol. It's basically a set of rules for packaging and routing data across a network. It involves taking the data you want to send, cutting it into roughly uniform chunks and putting them in the data equivalent of an envelope - or in internet parlance a 'packet'. Like any good envelope or packet it includes an address for where its contents are going and a return address saying where it's come from. 

If you're trying to picture how digital data passing along a cable can be wrapped up into a packet I should explain that it's all just ones and zeroes, but the IP standard specifies a layout for those ones and zeroes. The first chunk of ones and zeroes will be the 'header' which is like the envelope. The header will contain the destination address and the return address and a few other pieces of information. Next will come the contents or 'payload' of the 'packet' i.e. the data you're trying to send across the internet, which could be something like a request to fetch the home page for the website at snowbooks.com. 

But when it comes to the destination and return addresses, IP doesn't use a name like 'snowbooks.com'; it uses a number. This is similar to the way an old-style telephone doesn't let you type in the name of someone you want to talk to; it requires their phone number. So just like with telephones, the web requires a directory so that you can look up a name and get back a number that you can use to make a call. The way the directory is provided on the web is with something called 'DNS' and it's handled by your computer automatically so that you can surf the web without needing to know DNS even exists. But if it's your responsibility to add a new website to the web, you probably need to know the basics of what's going on.

The names on the web are 'domain names' (like 'snowbooks.com') and the numbers used to route data are called 'IP addresses' and most of them are four numbers, normally written separated by dots (e.g. '74.86.153.134'). You can buy the right to use a domain name by 'registering' it at one of the many Domain Name Registrars, like, say, <a href=""http://www.nominet.org.uk/"">nominet</a>. But until that domain name has an IP address associated with it, nobody can use it to visit a website or send you e-mail.

So once you've registered yourself a domain name you need to create some DNS records (DNS actually stands for 'Domain Name System'). By 'record' what I mean is a single entry in the database of the world's DNS information. The simplest possible setup is just to create a single record that associates your domain name with the IP address of the computer running your website. That kind of record is called an 'A' record (A = Address) and you might write it out like this:
Domain name ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IP Address
<code>snowbooks.com &nbsp;&nbsp; IN   A &nbsp;&nbsp; 74.86.153.134</code>

You would normally set that DNS 'A record' up with the company you registered your domain name with. They'll typically provide a control panel to use for that purpose. Where do you get the IP address from? Well, that's the IP address of the computer running your website. Assuming you're not a total DIY fanatic, you'll probably use a hosting company and rent a webserver from them. They'll tell you what the IP address of that server is and you'll create or update your 'A record' to 'point' your domain name to the webserver's IP address. That's how a domain name ('snowbooks.com') is associated with the IP address ('74.86.153.134') of a particular computer  (= your webserver) on the internet.

There are other types of DNS record that serve other functions but there are only two that I want to mention. The first is the 'MX record'. That's a DNS record for routing e-mail. The idea is that you have to specify the domain name address where you want your e-mail to go because you might want it to be processed on a different computer to the one running your webserver. In our case we used to use our webserver as the destination for our e-mail, but we decided to change to using an e-mail service provided by Google - and the way in which I screwed up that change is the reason you're reading this blog post.

You can also have more than one 'MX record' in case you want to set a backup computer to handle your e-mail. 'MX records' include a number you can use to decide which computer is at the top of the list for handling e-mail, which comes next and - if you're so minded - which comes after that. Low numbers come first, higher numbers later in terms of their priority. You can create as many different MX records as you like.

The final thing to say on the matter is to explain where DNS information is stored around the web. In theory, we'd put all the DNS entries for every webserver in the world on one really big computer and everyone would connect to it to get their DNS info. That's how it used to work back in the Eighties when the internet was a few hundred computers. With billions of computers on the net, that approach won't work. Plus there'd be the problem of who was allowed to change which pieces of information. I need to be allowed to alter the DNS records for my domains but nobody else's.

The answer is twofold. Firstly, there <em>are</em> master computers for the web, called the Root Name Servers, but they do a fairly simple job of breaking the web into top-level domains like '.com' and '.co.uk'. They tell any querying computer where to get more information about the top-level domain they're interested in. Thus when running a DNS query to find out the IP address of snowbooks.com, you could ask the Root Name Servers where to find nameservers for the '.com' part of the name. Then you'd send a DNS query to one of those servers in order to get information specifically about snowbooks.com. Those nameservers would then respond by providing the address of what's called the 'authoritative nameserver' for that domain. That's the nameserver that is in charge of that domain and whose information can be considered to be definitive. That will typically be the nameserver of the Domain Name Registrar where you registered your domain name. In our case we registered snowbooks.com with <a href=""http://www.lcn.com/"">LCN</a>, so their computers provide the 'authoritative nameserver' for snowbooks.com: the definitive source of DNS information for our website.

You specify the 'authoritative nameserver' using another type of DNS record called an 'NS record'. That 'NS record' is what the top-level nameservers use to find the DNS information that you set in the control panel: your 'A record' and your 'MX records'. 

That's part one of how the system works. Part two is the idea of 'caching'. Instead of letting you directly query one of the top-level nameservers, your ISP (Internet Service Provider) will give you the address of their own DNS servers to use for your queries. (Your router probably picks these up automatically when you connect to the internet by using a protocol called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhcp"">DHCP</a>.) If your ISP's servers get asked a DNS question they don't know the answer to, they go out and ask that same question of the top-level nameservers. But once they've done that they save the answer and next time they get asked the question, they simply give the same answer as last time. Periodically those nameservers will run the query again, just to check that the answer hasn't changed because if they cached DNS results forever then changing them on the top-level nameserver would have no effect and you'd never be able to update the settings for your website. It's a combination of top-level nameservers with authoritivative nameservers, plus the idea of DNS caching, that makes the whole system work even though billions of computers are constantly seeking DNS information.

And that brings us to where I screwed up Snowbooks' setup. I wanted to stop routing our e-mail to our webserver and start routing it to Google so that we could use the <a href=""http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html"">Google Apps for Business</a> service for our e-mail. What I did was to go to our Domain Name Registrar, LCN, and set up some MX records to direct our e-mail to Google's servers. What I hadn't realised was that our Domain Name Registrar wasn't the 'authoritative nameserver' for snowbooks.com. We had previously decided that our hosting company's nameservers would be authoritative for our domain. So the changes I made to the DNS records at LCN's nameserver had no effect because that's not where the DNS servers of the world were getting their information.

I waited the required 48 hours for the world's DNS servers to update their caches and (of course) found that our e-mail was still going to its old destination. So I complained to LCN. They looked into the matter and must have spotted that we were using someone else's nameserver not theirs. So in order to make my changes work they made their nameservers authoritative for our domain. But of course I hadn't created an 'A record' at LCN's servers - I assumed all that had been done long ago - I'd only created some 'MX records'. So once LCN's nameservers had become authoritative for our domain, all our e-mail used the new MX records, but there were no 'A records' to tell any web browsers where to find our website.

The situation was resolved by adding the appropriate 'A record' to LCN's nameserver and that's how you're able to read this now.","","","","2012-03-30","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

As you may know, I don't read a lot of fiction these days because of my very sensitive prose allergies, but I'm reading one now. It's a thriller and I'm about a third of the way in. The plucky heroine knows the bad guys are after her but can't work out why. But I know why. The back-cover blurb explained it to me. I know who they are and what their plan involves. You can imagine how that undercuts the drama as the main protagonist searches for answers. And she's still so far off working it out that I'm wondering what percentage of the story the blurb has spoiled. We're already at 35%, but I wouldn't be surprised if I have to get to the 60% mark before I've caught up with what the back cover already told me. If I were the author I'd be furious. And this is a very well-researched book, carefully structured, so for some editorial assistant to breeze in after it's written and drain the tension out of the first 150 pages with a few badly chosen words must be immensely frustrating for the writer - I know it is for me. And this is Macmillan, who presumably know better.

So, just for the record, blurbs are about whetting the appetite not sating it. You don't summarise the plot; you hint at it. A blurb is not a pr&eacute;cis.
<hr/>

<em>Update</em>: My guess was pretty good: at page 175 of 301, the story has finally caught up with the blurb. That's 56% of the way through the book.","","","","","2012-04-02","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","3"

I mentioned <a href=""http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/12/the_new_aesthetic.html"">The New Aesthetic</a> a while back. I certainly shouldn't be in the business of defining it, but I suppose if I were to try, I'd say it's a kind of reverse flow of imagery from the virtual world to the real. That's to say, when you see designed objects in the real world which take their stylistic cues from the features, artifacts and peculiarities of digital imagery you're probably in the realm of the New Aesthetic. (Alternatively, just go <a href=""http://new-aesthetic.tumblr.com/"">here</a> and look at the pictures until you see what they have in common.)

What I also mentioned was that the person most responsible for bringing the term and the ideas behind it to people's notice is James Bridle, who for a couple of years spent his time finding and publishing innovative fiction for lil' ol' Snowbooks. Whereas now he has influential thinkers like Bruce Sterling singing his praises in venues like Wired magazine. Here's the excerpt that caught my eye: ""<code>James Bridle is the master of that salon. James Bridle has never yet claimed to be the Andre Breton-style Pope of the New Aesthetic, but in practice, nobody ever asks the central questions of anybody else but him. So, Bridles the guru there. </code>""

I regularly see James's thoughts retweeted by people I look up to like William Gibson and Tim O'Reilly. And now he's the manifesto-writing guru behind an art movement. When James chaired a panel at SXSW this year, Bruce Sterling described it like this: ""<code>When I left the room at the SXSW New Aesthetic panel, this is what concerned me most. I left with the conviction that something profound had been touched. Touched, although not yet grasped. Id suggest getting right after it.</code>"" Nice work, James.

I like it when a newspaper picks up a topic important to publishers, like the threat of an Amazon monopoly. I don't like it when someone like James Heneage steps forward to give the media a quote and blows it by mumbling about irrelevancies. Perhaps he is being misquoted or the paper is focussing on what were intended to be peripheral remarks, but <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/apr/05/amazon-dangerous-ottakar-james-heneage"">this article</a> makes it seem like his main objection to Amazon is that they're not really members of the club. Have a <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/apr/05/amazon-dangerous-ottakar-james-heneage"">read</a>.

Firstly he seems to believe that great authors need to be nurtured by publishers: eliminating publishers imperils literature. I personally am quite sure that great authors will continue to emerge if 'publisher' goes the way of 'lamplighter' or 'footman'. He also seems to believe that publishers have an important role spotting those great writers: without publishers we wouldn't notice the diamonds in the rough. I agree that's a role publishers fill... for now. But if what replaces the current model is readers reading any old thing, including lots of self-published novels, and then blogging and tweeting about them, I think we'll see books with lasting appeal being taken up more not less quickly. I won't lament the loss of the 'kingmaker' role in publishing. And there will still be prominent figures who can champion new writing.

Heneage also thinks that Amazon is not 'investing'  enough in the industry, in (implied) contrast to the way that publishers do. He doesn't elaborate, but single-handedly developing and popularising a global e-book platform sounds like investing to me. As does allowing any solvent reader with an internet connection to get any book through the mail in a day or two - including titles that 99% of bricks-and-mortar stores never carried. And it may not be the sort of investment Heneage likes, but Amazon have also made books cheaper. In fact I would say that the problem is that Amazon is investing too much rather than too little.","Heneage concludes by saying that if you have the long-term success of the industry at heart you don't undermine the competition too much. This is a terribly woolly remark. Is he suggesting that the only thing that's stopped Macmillan or Random House from grabbing 99% of the book market is a sportsmanlike restraint and a custodial mindset? The directors of publicly-traded firms would be fired if they announced they'd called a halt to growth because they were worried about the competition.

Here's what Heneage should have said. We should worry about Amazon's oligopolistic power in the paper book world, and worry even more about their monopolistic dominance of the e-book sector. Monopolies are bad for everyone except the monopoly itself, which is why societies break them up or prevent them coming into existence in the first place - which isn't happening with Amazon. Geography gives local book owners some advantages with printed books. But when the product is downloaded, the biggest just tend to get bigger. Amazon hold all the cards here and DRM makes switching away from Amazon a costly and unpalatable proposition for readers.

If I were Heneage, I'd be arguing for a level playing field free from some arguably anti-competitive practices. Imagine if Amazon were forced to let you export your e-book library to another platform if you wanted to: that would at least give competitors a chance. Imagine if their prices were monitored to make sure they're not routinely selling at a loss. And imagine if there was an upper limit on the market share one firm could command like there is in many sectors. The threat from Amazon is its monopoly because it risks taking away the reader's options. So long as there is legitimate room for new players we can rely on innovation and reader sentiment to do most of the work in safeguarding what's good in the world of books.","","","","2012-04-06","2013-03-29","","","","Rob","1"

Snowbooks.com will not so much be 'down' as 'patchily populated' for about 45 mins this evening.

So forgive any rather spare-looking pages you come across between about 8 and 9pm tonight. I thank you. 

(I should say that once the push is completed, you won't see much difference - it's a big change to the code of the website, rather than the look and feel or content.

Ruby's a programming language, and Rails is a web development framework. I started learning Rails in early 2011 and have gone from n00b to pretty competent programmer in that time. I wish I could persuade you that being a serious programmer is necessary in modern publishing. In fact, let me try, and let me target my comments in particular&nbsp;at the people who keep emailing me at the moment for work experience.&nbsp;There seem to be a lot of you, so hopefully this <strike>rant</strike> will help a few people.&nbsp;&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Right, hands up. Who wants to be an editor when they grow up? Anyone want to run a small press? Production manager? Sales director? Digital marketing manager? Author, even?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>
OK, so you all want to be editors. (I've never had a conversation with someone aspiring to get into publishing who <i>didn't</i> want to be an editor). So, say you get your dream editorial job.&nbsp;I have a slightly heavy follow-up&nbsp;question. In your mind, jump to the end of your career, and consider&nbsp;your legacy.&nbsp;What do you want to leave behind? You might be happy to muddle along. But you're a thinking fellow, right?&nbsp;It's likely that you might have hopes that you can contribute to the sum total of human knowledge in your chosen field of work. Publishing, as you know, is competitive to get into and to thrive in. If you want to do something notable, something cool, what do you need?
<br><br>My brilliant advice, like all brilliant advice, comes in two parts. <br><br>Part the first. You don’t actually need competence, or a gift, or talent. What you need most, I have decided, is tenacity. You can do pretty much anything if you have enough tenacity. You can learn a programming language. You can read three books a week. You can practice your art - whether that’s writing, editing, designing or professional development. So. Get tenacious. Stick at things. Stop moaning.&nbsp;Keep trying. &nbsp;<br><br>Brilliant advice, part two, is about craftsmanship. Pretty much anything is worth doing, and worthy of leaving behind when you're gone, if it's done well. Don't believe the people who tell you that perfectionism is a&nbsp;bad thing. Whether it’s designing&nbsp;a beautiful and functional font, or a lovely bit of code, or crafting&nbsp;a perfectly-turned&nbsp;phrase, more often that not perfectionism is necessary.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>

How do you find the time to aspire to&nbsp;perfection? To do things that make a difference? To lift your head above the torrent of admin, drudge, sameness, endless emails, endless phone calls? And how the hell do you find time and perfection when you’d just like to get a job, first of all, and then keep it?

<br><br>The problem -- and the solution -- is that every single area of publishing has changed. Every single aspect of publishing now relies on technology to do a good job. Challenge me. Can you think of an area of publishing which doesn't rely on technology?<br><br>Here's the big secret.&nbsp;If you are technically competent, you can automate the dull stuff so you can spend time on the cool stuff.&nbsp;You can use technology to create things of staggering beauty and wonder that you will be proud to leave behind. And&nbsp;you’ll be indispensable! People love people who can fix things, who know how things work, who understand all that computer stuff. 

<br><br>Rob &amp; I have said this sort of thing for years, to whoever will listen, and no-one does. So not only will you be competent, proud of yourself and useful: you'll be rare.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I fall well&nbsp;short of perfection the whole time, obviously. In fact I can imagine the guffaws of laughter from anyone who knows me, reading this. I am laughing, myself.&nbsp;But I try to get as close to perfect as I can in my projects, and it's one of the reasons I've fallen in love with programming. A program won't compile (or run if it's an interpreted language such as Ruby) if it's anything less than&nbsp;perfect -- down to the last semi-colon. I like that challenge, and I like the quiet,&nbsp;single-minded focus that programming requires.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Start with the Rails Tutorial&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""#five"">[ 5]</a>&nbsp;and see where it takes you.&nbsp;And let me know how you get on. If more of us in publishing turn our hand to acquiring the necessary skills for&nbsp;our adaption and&nbsp;survival, it would be nice to stick together, swap notes, that kind of thing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In the meantime, I hope you enjoy looking round the new Snowbooks.com.&nbsp;</div>","<p>Footnotes</p>

<p><span>H</span>im <span>O</span>r Me</p>
<p>Every child knows how the story ends. The wicked pirate captain is flung overboard, caught in the jaws of the monster crocodile, which drags him down to a watery grave. Who could guess that below the water, the great beast would spew me out with a belch and a wink of its horned, livid eye? It was not yet my time to die, not then nor any other time. It’s my fate to be trapped here forever in a nightmare of childhood fancy with that infernal, eternal boy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one knows what came next, the part you never read about in the stories. I clawed through water bloodied by the corpses of my crew driven overboard to make a meal for the sharks, flailed for the hull of my ship before the sharks caught up to me.</p>
<p>I saw it all by moonrise as I hooked my way up the chains to the deck. One of my men lay asprawl on the hatch coaming, dead eyes staring at the moon, curled fingers frozen over his ruptured belly. Another had dragged himself a few paces toward the rail before he expired, leaving a smear of fresh blood on the deck that could never be stained red enough to disguise it. Half a dozen others lay about in shadowy heaps, limbs twisted, faces ghastly, silent as waxworks. Everything stank of blood and decay. One man was draped face down over the foredeck rail, arrows sprouting from his back. The&nbsp;<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""display: inline; float: none; "">redskins were teaching the boys archery, as if they needed any more advantage over us in battle. None of the dead were boys.</span></p>
<p>Those who’d gone over the side screamed no more. The ship’s bell, rung when the battle commenced, tolled no more. Even the monstrous ticking had subsided. My ship was as silent as the tomb she had become. The boys had gone larking off again, but not in my ship; all of the fairies’ black arts could not raise my <i>Jolie Rouge </i>out of her moldering berth in the bay. Solemn drumbeats from the island told me the Indians were collecting their dead from our skirmish in the wood, but none were left to mourn my men but me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started for the nearest body, to drag it to the ship’s boat, but as I passed the deckhouse, something groaned within. The deckhouse. That’s where he’d hidden to lure us into his trap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shoved open the door, peered into the reeking gloom. Jukes I recognized by the sprawl of his tattoos in the ghostly moonlight. The Italian lay nearby, face frozen in an eternal scream. I crept in across sticky planks toward a soft grumble of pain, a sudden seizure of breath. My fingers touched still-living flesh, and Jukes groaned again. There was a new hieroglyph on his naked chest, thrust in with less art than the rest, and still leaking red. I knelt in the puddle, worked my hook arm round his back and propped him up. Heavy as a corpse already, yet his head lolled back on my arm and his dull eyes opened to look at me.</p>
<p>One. The boy had left me only one.</p>
<p>“Well, Bill.” I could scarcely steady my voice.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Cap’n,” he lisped through the blood in his mouth. “He come at me in the dark.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk,” I cautioned, yet I was desperate for the comfort of his voice. We’d sailed together since New Providence; his pictographic skin was a living gallery of&nbsp;<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""display: inline; float: none; "">our exploits from the Indies to the Gold Coast. He was the closest thing I’d ever had to a friend in the pirate trade. “Save your strength.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>But it was already too late. We both knew it. The boy hadn’t even done it proper; life was escaping in an agonizing drip, not a clean burst.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jukes dragged another tortured breath out of his ruined lungs. “Thought you was done for,” he wheezed.</p>
<p>“Come, now, you know me better than that.” I clenched my teeth in assumed heartiness. “No mere boy is a match for me.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>A furtive smile glimmered briefly amid the blue and black dots and calligraphic swirls on his face. I could see what even so slight a movement cost him in misery. There was only one way to help him now, could I but steel myself to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The women are warm in Hell, eh, Cap’n?” he prompted me.</p>
<p>“Save me a place at the Devil’s mess,” I answered by rote, summoning every ounce of my resolve.</p>
<p>Red bubbled between his teeth. “Aye, aye—”&nbsp;</p>
<p>His eyes bulged for an instant, whites agleam in the shadows, then the lids drooped in relief. “Thank’ee, Cap’n,” wafted out on his last breath, as I extracted my knife from between his ribs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gone, all of them gone now. Slaughtered one by one, like a game. It’s all a game to the boys.</p>
<p>I stretched Jukes out beside the twisted Italian, sat back on my heels, forced my brain to think on practical matters. Two or three trips in the gig it would take to see them all properly consigned to deep water. The eerie, animal keening of the loreleis singing to the moon rose up across the water, cold and tormenting. I was the last human left alive in the Bay of Neverland.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""display: inline; float: none; "">The Neverland, they call it, the infant paradise, the puerile Eden where grown-ups dare not tread. They are wise to fear it. But all children visit in their dreams. He finds them by their longing, stray boys for his tribe and girls to tell him stories.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>They are not always English children, although he is partial to London. They have erected a statue to him there. Fancy, a public statue of Pan, the boy tyrant in his motley of leaves, like a king or a hero. While Hook is reviled, the evil pirate, the villain. There is no statue to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve heard all the stories. I know the world thinks me not only a simpering fop but a great coward, so affrighted by the crocodile I would empty my bowels at the first sinister tick of its clock. But it’s the ticking itself I can’t bear, the tolling of the minutes, the very seconds, that I am forced to spend in the Neverland for all eternity. Elsewhere, time is passing in the normal way, but not here. Not for me and the boy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s Hook or me this time,” the boy jeered as the massacre began. But it’s never him. And it’s never me. Since then, he has defeated me innumerable times, but never quite to the death. He wills it so, and his will rules all. How often have I felt my skin pierced, imagined in my wounded delirium that Death has relented and come for me at last? Yet every time, my blood stops leaking, my flesh knits. Sooner or later, my eyes open again to yet another bleak new day, with nothing to show for my pains but another scar on the wreckage of my body.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder I so often tried to kill him? Would not his death break the enchantment of this awful place and release us both? But I can never best him. He flies. He has youth and innocence on his side, and the heartlessness that comes with them. I have only heartlessness, and it is never, ever enough.</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""display: inline; float: none; "">Outside the deckhouse, the night had gone dark. I crept out again, still drenched in Bill Jukes’ blood, and saw that the moon itself, so full and white an hour before, had turned red, as if she too were awash in blood. A red eclipse, as mariners say, but never before had I seen the shadow of the old world fall across the Neverland moon. Perhaps it was only a trick of my fevered imagination, or some monstrous reflection from the deck of the <i>Rouge</i>, yet it glared down on me like a bloodshot eye, catching me out in all my crimes.</span></p>
<p>Once, I thought I could never have enough of blood. It was all that could satisfy me, for so long. But it wearies me now, the tyranny of blood-lust, the serpent that feeds on itself. The game that never changes. The game that never ends.</p>
<p>“How long can you stay angry at the world?” she asked me once. Why didn’t I listen?<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); display: inline; float: none; ""></span></p><p></p>","&nbsp;","","","2012-11-22","2012-11-23","1","","","","0"
"42675","5045","36","Bibliocloud training day","Publish","","First post!, as it's customary to declare. Welcome to the Bibliocloud blog. We'll use it to let you know what's going on development-wise, as well as keeping you in the loop with news for Bibliocloud's user community. Let me tell you what's going on at the moment...","<p>This last week's been exciting. I had lunch a couple of weeks ago with Joshua from The Bookseller during which I  waved my hands around excitedly and talked ten-to-the-dozen about the supply chain, the vagaries of independent publishing and metadata. Despite this, he still wrote a lovely piece about Bibliocloud which resulted in a flurry of goodwill and sign-ups. We've got around 40 live client accounts at the moment. The trick, though, is making sure that everyone's making the most of the system. To this end we ran a training day on Friday, paid for by our Arts Council England grant. We had a good turn out - to the extent that we had a waiting list, so we'll be running another one in the New Year. Email me if you'd like more details. </p>
<br/>
<p>The training agenda covered most of the basics - navigation, search and select, and setting up works, their contributors, and their editions. We looked at how to import data, such as your ISBN13 list, your sales, and your existing book data from CSV or ONIX, or from scraping the internet. Then we exported data - in ONIX 2.1 and 3, and in the form of PDF AIs, a frontlist and backlist catalogue, CSV files and Excel spreadsheets complete with graphs and totals rows, as well as a life-saving rights guide (if you've ever realised the night before Frankfurt that you haven't done one...), a title verso page and PDF statements. We looked at ONIX validation for both 2.1 and 3.0. Bibliocloud validates against the ONIX schemas, but also against reality - so the validator will fail if you have named a book ""placeholder"" or ""tbc"", for instance. We then looked at FTPing images and ONIX data to data aggregators at the click of a button. </p>
<br/>

<p>We looked at the acquisition, forecasting, print and scheduling area which is still under development - it'll be finished in Feb 2013 but already it has Gantt chart schedulers, a sales forecasting tool and a supplier tender function. Bibliocloud's been producing royalty statements for a couple of years for Snowbooks, so we looked at rights, royalties and contracts including the rather gorgeous royalty statement PDF that the system generates.</p>
<br/>

<p>And a bunch of other stuff that came up when we went off on tangents. It was a good, fun day and I'm looking forward to the next one - I'll let you know when it is. </p>
 <br/>

<p>More blogging to come...back to development for now!</p>","","","","2012-12-17","2012-12-17","38","","","","0"
"42676","5045","36","Features in development","Publish","","I hope the training day last week was useful for delegates: it was certainly useful for us because of the great ideas that flowed throughout the day on improvements and additions to Bibliocloud. Here’s a summary of the ideas we noted which will be rolled out as part of Bibliocloud over the next few months.

(edit: I'm updating the list below as we work through the additions.)","We’ll make the system detect when a contact’s name is a duplicate of one that’s already on the system, dependent on the contact’s type. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll add a role name or photo to the Contact index page so it’s clearer which contact is which when there’s a shared name. DONE: you'll see the change on the Contact index page. You can now add photos to each contact: look for the new tab called ""Files"" when you're editing your contact data. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll add a word counter on marketing text fields. DONE: you will see a word counter on every marketing text field when you're editing your works. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll add a search function to all pages, including the AI archives page. 
<br/><br/>

We’ll make the AI archive easier to manage, so that there’s only one current version but there’s still a useful history of previous versions, and frontlist and backlist versions. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll build in the option to automate the transmission of ONIX data, whilst retaining the option to control when data is sent. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll add a bulk-paste option to the search area on works and editions so records can be identified through pasting ISBN lists. DONE: simply paste a list of ISBNs into the search bar of any one of the Works, Works Proposals, Editions or Editions Proposals index pages. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll consider adding the option of calculating royalties based on a profit share
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll add reporting in to aggregate reporting on contribution etc
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll buff and polish the payment type for fees section. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll include rights revenue in the profit report
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll look at automatically importing clients’ PayPal sales
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll make it possible to generate QR codes and look at a QR/barcode reader for use when hand-selling books.  DONE: see http://youtu.be/zufPdUAB28Q
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll add in a lot more functionality around forecasting, production and reporting. 
<br/>
<br/>
Since the training day we’ve started implementation of a change log which should be available in the next few days. We’ll let you know when it’s ready to look at. 
<br/>
<br/>
As ever, if you think of any new ideas to add into Bibliocloud, don’t hesitate to tell us!","","","","2012-12-18","2012-12-21","38","","","","0"
"42677","5045","36","Quick tip: concatenate multiple CSV files","Publish","","If you're importing sales, oftentimes you need to import more than one CSV file at a time. Here's a shortcut for the Mac to help you combine multiple files into one new one.","Create a folder on your desktop and put the csv files in it. 
Open a Terminal window and type the following:

cat *.csv > my-new-file.csv

Immediately you'll have a new file called my-new-file, which contains the content of all the other files in that folder.

This works for data files other than CSV.","","","","2012-12-21","2012-12-21","38","","","","0"

It means that if you manage a number of publisher clients, or if your business is clearly split into publishing sections, you can have a parent account which your various publisher accounts report in to.","<br/>
You'll have to ask us to create a new Group. Once that's done: 
<br/>
- First go to bibliocloud.com and make sure you're signed out. Then go to bibliocloud.com/register and register as a new client. Call the account anything other than your existing company account name (it won't let you enter a duplicate name, anyway). <a href=""#one"">[ 1]</a>
<br/>
Click through from the confirmation email you'll receive, to sign in. 
<br/>
In your new client account go to Edit Client which is the last option on the last tab on the navigation bar, where all the other preferences and settings are. Click on ""Join Another Group"", bottom left. Select your group from the drop down list. 
<br/>
Now, sign out of Bibliocloud and sign in to the main company account. On the first nav bar tab you'll see a link, Access Group Settings for [your company account name]. You should be able to access both the main account and the new account you've just set up. You'll see some nascent info about the group clients - just a work count for the time being. Obviously this page will evolve into a more complete dashboard.","<p>Footnotes</p>
<ol class=""footnotes"">
<li id=""one"">[1]  As a tip if you have a gmail account or your email is managed by Google Apps, you can have email proxies which go to the same account - this is handy because obviously you can't use the same email address for more than one client account.

"42682","5045","36","This week's developments: edition collections and DAM","Publish","","2013 has started with a flurry of activity, despite Bibliocloud Towers getting zapped by the evil cough virus that's going around. Now live on Bibliocloud are the following new features: 
<br/>
- the ability to save collections of Editions
<br/>

- digital asset management master-list
<br/>
We also upgraded to Rails 3.2.11. This was to accommodate a security patch released by the Rails core team <a href=""http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/8/Rails-3-2-11-3-1-10-3-0-19-and-2-3-15-have-been-released/"">[link]</a>.
<br/>
The current immediate work-in-progress is: 
<br/>
- Purchase order reports for print orders
<br/>
- Massive improvements in the royalties module
<br/>
- Writing up the overall road-map with all our planned developments
<br/>
- Providing the option to schedule automatic pushes of ONIX data to the usual suspects. 
<br/>
- Finishing up the P&L report (you can see work in progress on the new Assessment tab on any Work record).
<br/>

As ever, do <a href=""mailto:emma@bibliocloud.com"">shout</a> with any questions.","<h4>Save collections of Editions.</h4>
Go to Editions, select a bunch of records and hit ""Edit checked"". Scroll to the bottom of the page until you see ""Add to  group"". Create a new group by clicking on ""New Collection"", to the right of the field (you can also get there from the Settings menu, if you have admin privileges). Select the newly-created collection from the drop-down list and click ""Add to group"". Once you've done that, you can search for that group in the Advanced Search section on the Editions index page. Then you can do all sorts of things with that selection of editions: create AIs, create ONIX messages and so on. 
<h4>Digital asset management master-list </h4>
You'll see a new tab on the nav bar called Digital Assets. Click on ""Digital Assets Management master-list"" and you'll be taken to a menu page. Click on the type of asset you want to look at and you'll see a list of them appear. <br/>
The DAM master-list pulls together into one place all of the various assets in Bibliocloud: covers, ePub files, barcodes, AIs, ONIX exports and so on. So it's just a handy way to see everything in one place. The assets are still also found in their relevant homes throughout Bibliocloud: AIs are still in the AIs archive, for instance. <br/>Remember, you can store any sort of file on Bibliocloud, of any size. All uploads are handled in the background, so even if your file is 80mb, a separate process will trundle away until it's uploaded, leaving you to keep working without having to wait or get timed-out.","","","","2013-01-13","2013-01-13","38","","","","0"

<br/>
edited by Scott Harrison
<br/>
Snowbooks £7.99 534 pages 
<br/>
Resurrection Engines sees an assortment of authors re-envision literary classics through the prism of steampunk (the subgenre of SF which celebrates Victorian invention and technology in a knowing, retro-futuristic style). Robots abound. Dr Jekyll’s monstrous alter ego is a sentient military exoskeleton, Peter Pan creates his own scrap-metal Lost Boys, and Silas Marner, in a moving tale by Alison Littlewood, adopts an artificial Eppie. Another common steampunk trope, the airship, features in Alan K. Baker’s high-concept Verne/Wells mash-up ‘A Journey To The Centre Of The Moon’ and in Jonathan Green’s swashbuckling sky-borne take on Moby-Dick, ‘There Leviathan’. The contributors who stray furthest from the brief bring back the richest rewards. Juliet E. McKenna’s feminist rewrite of She is cunning and funny, and Philip Palmer adds aliens to The Woman In White to great effect. Adam Roberts’s delirious ‘The Crime Of The Ancient Mariner’ replaces Coleridge’s sea voyage with time travel, and works a treat. A foreword from the editor, contextualising the stories, would have been welcome. Nonetheless, this anthology is both varied and consistently entertaining.

"42687","5045","36","Latest additions","Publish","","Our changes this week provide a range of improvements across Bibliocloud, from user interface improvements to changes down in the depths of Bibliocloud.","From an ease of use point of view, we've re-jigged a few areas so that they make more sense. For instance, when you go in to edit a work, you'll see the Proposals tab first which provides a summary of the most important information at a glance. It's a nicely laid out page which summarises a lot of info about the work, and you can edit the text in place rather than having to go to another form to make changes.  
<br/><br/>
If you have a number of imprints in your company, each with different ISBN prefixes, it can be confusing to know which ISBN you should assign to which new edition. Now, on the ISBN13 drop down list, we include the name of the imprint as well as the ISBN13, so it's more straightforward to see which ISBN13 you should allocate to a new edition.
 <br/><br/>

We've tightened up a few things to make workflow more rigorous. For instance, if a proposed work fails to meet the company's minimum threshold for margin contribution it'll be flagged up with a warning to senior management if you attempt to sign it off.

The marketing texts area has received a magnificent sprucing thanks to some great user feedback. It's now got a weighted star rating which takes the average of all users' ratings; you can attach scanned copy files; you can record the reviewer and the publication if it's a review and you can add keyword tags. The tagging functionality is rather splendid in itself because it means you can efficiently search across works, editions, contacts and marketing texts for keywords. We've thrown in a weighted word cloud of the tags on the homepage for good measure. 
<br/><br/>

We've linked Bibliocloud to the Twitter API. At the company level, your account updates itself automatically with the latest tweets that mention your company name. Then we collect the latest ten tweets for each mention of each edition's title, and each contact's name.  You can also post tweets directly from Bibliocloud -- we grab the first 109 characters of each marketing text and add in a short link. One click and it's tweeted to Twitter -- whilst Bibliocloud keeps a record of what you've tweeted. We've also hooked up to the Google Books API. In the marketing section you can see all recently published books, and those about to be published, with any information that Google Books has about them.  We'll do the same with Facebook, Goodreads and other APIs in due course -- do let us know which ones are most important to you.

One of the principles of good software design is that the user should be in charge -- the software shouldn't do unexpected things behind the scenes.  This principle comes to the fore when we consider how data should be saved. On the one hand, it would seem quite useful to auto-save data. But what if you're just tinkering, not realising that your data is being saved and thus available to other users -- for instance an unfinished blurb? What about when you're creating a new record -- would you want that to be saved before you've finished? Also autosaving before you've finished amending a form properly would throw up validation errors if you haven't yet got to a field which is required, which would be confusing and annoying. 
<br/><br/>

Instead, we've implemented a couple of changes which stop you losing unsaved work but which don't take you by surprise. One is that when you've edited a form field, the colour of the field's label immediately changes to blue. It's an easy way to see that there's unsaved data on the page. The other measure we've taken is to pop up a dialogue box if you're about to leave a page which contains unsaved changes. 
<br/><br/>

On the user interface side of things, we've moved Settings down to its own tool icon. The navigation bar helps you to walk through the basic publishing workflow, and we decided that ""Settings"" doesn't really fit into that. So all of the preferences -- things such as currency rates, sales channels settings, your ISBN13 list, rights codes and so on, as well as the ability to switch background colours -- are now on a drop-down list marked with a spanner icon under the main nav bar. 
<br/><br/>

We've spruced up the Address book a little. Bibliocloud shows or hides fields as appropriate, without having to refresh the browser, depending on whether you're creating a new person record, or a new organisation record. 
<br/><br/>

Behind the scenes we've also made a few changes that you wouldn't necessarily notice, such as a means of resolving UTF encoding problems in the CSV importer. We're also writing additional tests to keep our test coverage high, and using the latest metrics tools to continue to tune our code and database. And coming very soon is our newly written royalties module which will knock your socks off. 
<br/><br/>

We've got a list as long as your arm of additional changes that we're itching to include, so we'll keep cracking on with that, and keep you posted!","","","","2013-02-26","2013-02-26","38","","","","0"

"42689","5045","36","London Book Fair prep","Publish","","I really must update this blog more often: we add features so frequently, I end up forgetting them. I'll go through the code commit log to update you on all the recent changes. But first: prizes! 
<br/><br/>
We're one of four companies to be selected to present at a pitch session at the Digital Minds conference the day before the London Book Fair. Part of our prize is a space at <a href=""http://www.londonbookfair.co.uk/Focus-On/Lets-Talk-Digital/"">Tech Central</a>, an area dedicated to start ups and innovation, stand number Z505. We'll also be presenting on the Wednesday from 14.30 on Wednesday 17 April, Digital Theatre 1, Digital Zone. We'd love to see you there!

You'll notice that Bibliocloud has unveiled a completely new look this week, both on the guest website (the bit that you see before signing in) and on the main Bibliocloud site itself. We're in the happy position of having some very engaged customers whose insight and feedback is invaluable in improving the software (thanks, chaps). Based on their thoughts and experiences using Bibliocloud, we've radically changed the navigation to be more straightforward and more aligned to real life. Log in to have a look, or see the screenshots on our new guest website.","Part of the new look is a Quick Jump section, to be found on the left when you're editing a book, book proposal, rights edition, non book product, printing, contract, rights deal and address book entry. It lets you see at a glance info associated with the record. For instance, if you're editing a book, you can Quick Jump to the book's authors, its printings, contract, rights deals and schedules. If you jump to a printing, you can then see and jump to the contracts, schedules and other printings. 
<br/><br/>

We've added a notes section in to a lot of the areas. You can add a note, then other users can reply to it -- so you can track a conversation. 
<br/><br/>

In the printings area, we've added Dues as well as Estimates to help you decide how many to print. You record both dues and estimates in the book proposals area. There's a brand new, comprehensive Shipments report, again accessible from the printings area, which summarises printing deliveries by shipment and calculates prices based on carton count, carton weight and pallet costs and from shipping rates which you can store by channel and supplier. 
<br/><br/>

The schedules area has had a lot of work done on it, including validations to see at a glance which tasks on which schedules are failing. There's a missed mllestones report for management to see a summary of problems. Schedules are now polymorphic meaning they can belong to one of many sections: printings, contracts, books, and contacts, for instance. 
<br/><br/>

We've introduced the idea of being able to lock fields. We've only implemented it in a few areas so far, but it allows the user to lock fields such as the price or the contributor statement. Handy if you don't want anyone to accidentally change something such as the price or the blurb after the book's been printed and published.
<br/><br/>

There's a new Design section. This allows you to track the cover design process, and any other design elements. Cover design meetings can be contentious and so we allow you to record minutes and agreements as well as key cover briefing information.  
<br/><br/>

There's a new section for non book products: we call it Maps, Stationery, Display and Merch. We could call it Everything Not Books, I suppose... it's where you'll store info about dumpbins, spinners and things included in books such as crystals or pens. 
<br/><br/>

We've improved the search in the digital assets area, so now you can search by book title to retrieve everything about that book: the barcode, cover, print files, contract, AIs etc. 
<br/><br/>

We've hidden the concept of a Work. It's still in the system but we've reduced the user interface complexity by tucking it away. Now, you simply edit a book -- but if you come across data which should be held at work level, Bibliocloud will store it as such behind the scenes. You get a cleaner interface whilst still being able to share data properly across the editions of a work. 
<br/><br/>

We've done a new catalogue for the London Book Fair next week. You can download it <a href=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/static/bibliocloud_brochure_small.pdf"">here</a>. 
<br/><br/>

We've made it easier to get your ISBN13 list from Nielsen into Bibliocloud. Now, simply paste the whole lot -- thousands, if necessary -- from Excel into Bibliocloud. You'll be able to automatically allocate them to new books. 
<br/><br/>

There are dozens of little smoothings and tweaks that have come about from the redesign of the site. Best thing is to have a look around and come across them as you're using the site. The idea is that things will just magically be in the right place when you need them. Hopefully, that's your experience: as ever, we thrive on feedback so don't hesitate to send through wish-lists, comments, complaints and more!","","","","2013-04-08","2013-04-08","38","","","","0"
