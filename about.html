<h1>Over sixteen years of fine independent publishing</h1>
<section>
		<p>Snowbooks started in a spare room in Hackney in April 2003 and soon moved to a couple of rented desks in a business incubator on Old Street – before it was cool. We hired staff, signed up authors and our first books hit the shelves in 2004. Waterstone's – <a href="https://twitter.com/SadApostrophe">before its possessive apostrophe was banished</a> – were our first and most supportive customer and with their backing our first books sold several tens of thousands of copies.</p>

		<p>We've always been very interested in the business side of publishing – about being more efficient and canny than others. Early on, it pretty soon gave us a high profile. We won a Nibbie, then another one, then an IPA award too. Later, our books started to win prizes too: <a href="http://localhost:4000/books/the-red-men/">The Red Men</a> got shortlisted for the Arthur C. Clarke award and Mark Hodder won the <a href="http://awfulagent.com/mark-hodder-wins-philip-k-dick-award">Philip K Dick</a> award with <a href="http://localhost:4000/books/burton-and-swinburne-in-the-strange-affair-of-spring-heeled-jack/">Spring Heeled Jack</a>. You can find reviews of our books everywhere, from <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1468986/Lost-essay-by-Virginia-Woolf-to-be-published.html">The Telegraph</a> and <a href="https://davidbarnett.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/25102013gideonsunreview.jpg">The Sun</a> to SFX Magazine, <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ICBL1NT5PMc/VEremd7arKI/AAAAAAAAWYw/HXXxvamXjAg/s1600/YATH%2BSciFiNow%2Breview.jpg">SciFiNow</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culturevultureblog/2006/may/15/snowondersnow">The Guardian</a> and on <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=13&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjz7PaSxrTYAhXEZ1AKHb2ADfAQFghWMAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwordsaremycraft.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F02%2F28%2Fsnow-books-you-dont-belong-here-by-tim-major%2F&usg=AOvVaw345i_U5m2SyEJRsldlqG5o">all</a> shapes and sizes of blog.</p>

		<p>Our efficiency has been made possible by our technological skill. We are publishers-turned-programmers, specializing in the gorgeously poetic Ruby language and the web application development framework Rails. With the benefit of a sizeable Arts Council grant we launched a sister company, <a href="http://generalproducts.co">General Products Ltd</a>, in 2012. Through it we licence the software we've written to other publishers, in the expectation that it'll help them as much as it helps Snowbooks. Our main product is <a href="https://consonance.app">Consonance</a>, an enterprise-level publishing management system. The website you're reading right now was populated with data and images from Consonance's <a href="https://api.consonance.app">API</a> in a single click. The combination of sleek technological efficiency and solid creative excellence is, for us, as potent and heady a combination as it's ever been. So in 2013, Consonance won us the Futurebook Best Technology Innovation award, and the Services to Independent Publishing award in 2017.</p>

		<p>So here's to the next sixteen years. Let's hope they're as fun as the first.</p>
