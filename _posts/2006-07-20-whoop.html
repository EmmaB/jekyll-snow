Yip yippety yipee yip. Top ten! (click to enlarge) Because we can't afford Nielsen Bookdata (you would not believe how expensive it is which is a topic for another day) we have no idea whether our books are actually selling. Kind of ridiculous, especially when considering whether to reprint. To come to this: I used to manage a 120m pound supply chain, and now I don't even know what my volume sales are. ANYWAY, enough griping: when a book appears in the top ten it's a good thing. So hooray. Go out and buy more copies! I want it to beat Life of Pi!  <br/>Emma
