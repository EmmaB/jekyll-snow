We're putting comments back on. <strike>But first we need to do some lever-yanking, spanner-bashing stuff behind the curtain. So if anything looks weird, it's probably my fault. On this weblog, I mean. If stuff outside the website looks weird, consult a doctor. Or, y'know, just roll with it. More soon.</strike>

We've wanted them back for a while, because a blog isn't a good blog unless it engages with its readers, and has conversations instead of just talking to itself. We originally turned them off because we were getting overwhelmed with comments, many of them off-topic or otherwise unsuitable, and the job of managing them was starting to detract from our primary job, which is publishing lovely books.

After numerous requests, and much subsequent soul-searching, we've turned them back on. Please use them wisely so that we can keep them open, and if anyone offers you any ~v14Gra, <em>just say no</em>.

Here's to lots more conversations.  <br/>
