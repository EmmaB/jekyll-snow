<img alt="elephants.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/elephants.jpg" width="136" height="96" align="right" style=" margin: 5px 0px 10px 15px;"/>There's a piece in the Bookseller today about Quercus. <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/control/?p=6&a=35435">It says that</a>

"Quercus, publisher of Costa winner Steph Penney's The Tenderness of Wolves ... said its revenue in the quarter to end-December 2006 was &pound;1.6 million, up from &pound;200,000 for the same period a year ago. Profits for the quarter jumped to &pound;200,000 from &pound;10,000 a year ago."

Hmm. That's good an'all, but when read in conjunction with <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/control/?p=6&a=34055">this </a>it makes my eyebrows go up: 

"Quercus has become a poster child for the rising fortunes of small British publishers. Small publishers such as Quercus, said Anthony Cheetham, chairman, have benefited from the new publishing landscape."

Blimey. If they are small, with &pound;200k profit and &pound;1.6m turnover, what are we?  <br/>Emma
