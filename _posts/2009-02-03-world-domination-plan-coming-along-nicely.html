The headlines are about snow, but <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/news/76232-snow-settles-over-uk-book-business.html">what do commenters think the story is about</a>? [In Mr Burns voice] Exxxcellent. 

(Although I did detect the tiniest touch of narkiness. That Emma Barnes parping away on her <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/04/parp.html">trumpet </a>again. She probably orchestrated the snowfall just to boost her company's PR. When will she learn humility?)  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
