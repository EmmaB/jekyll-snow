Back in the dot.com boom era there was much talk of 'disintermediation'. In case you don't know the word, you could think of it as meaning cutting-out-the-middleman-ation. In the late Nineties, the internet improved everyone's visibility of... everything, really. And sometimes you no longer needed a middleman to introduce you to someone you could do business with. Or, more importantly, perhaps you no longer wanted to pay for the privilege of what amounted to a Google search. This is the 'middleman as dating agency' role: matching buyers and sellers, clients to service-providers. In most cases, the middleman does more than just bring the two parties together. But <em>how much</em> more they do makes all the difference to whether they get disintermediated once buyers and sellers can find each other in other (usually internet-related) ways.

There's been a lot of talk recently of publishers being disintermediated by authors who self-publish, going direct to the retailers themselves. I don't think Amazon are the first to do the same thing from the other end, but given how they seem poised to take over the world - at least the book world (see previous <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/10/amazon_hegemony.html#more">post</a>) - it's probably worth watching when they decide that part of the book supply-chain needs reconfiguring. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/technology/amazon-rewrites-the-rules-of-book-publishing.html?_r=2">New York Times</a> will give you the details if you're interested, but the gist is that Amazon are publishers now as well as... almost everything else (including sellers of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/AudioQuest-K2-terminated-speaker-cable/product-reviews/B000J36XR2/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_summary?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending">sarcasm-inducingly expensive cables</a>).  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
