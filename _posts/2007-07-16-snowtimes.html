Snowbooks in <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/showbiz/article2069184.ece">the Times on Friday:</a> 

"Snowbooks has signed up a real book in the virtual world of Second Life. Its Emma Barnes and Will Francis, of the agents Greene & Heaton, - or rather their avatars - struck a deal there for Sarah Stovell's Mothernight. "It was much more informal and creative than doing it by e-mail or letter," Barnes says."

I also said it was a complete gimmick so it's very sweet of Nic not to have quoted me on that!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
