Check out Liz's website for a from the heart <a href="http://www.myfavouritebooks.blogspot.com ">review</a> of Mothernight. She writes: 

"I am worried about gushing about Mothernight but I can't remember the last time I read a book that was so - hard to explain - so, I don't know...immaculately written.  So I penned the review below. I'm taking a break for a day or two from reading fiction, purely because I will get annoyed by other books not written to this standard.  I went through exactly the same thing when I read Stephanie Meyer's YA novels.  Everything afterwards seemed inconsequential." 

How smashing. I mean, not that I want our books to destroy people's ability to read other fiction, no. (But secretly, yes.)  <br/>Emma
