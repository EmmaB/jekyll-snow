Wow, if I was on the Orange Longlist I'd be leaping for joy. My passport to fame and riches! Sadly, no. The Bookseller reports: 

"Less well-known titles received the biggest uplift, although with limited sales, with Samantha Hunt's The Invention of Everything Else (Harvill Secker) jumping 700% from one copy sold to eight."

Eight copies sold in the week it gets onto the longlist for one of the top three literary prizes. Whoop dee doo.  <br/>Emma
