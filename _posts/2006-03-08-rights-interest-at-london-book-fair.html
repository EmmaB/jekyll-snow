Hey, this is my first ever blog. I just wanted to tell everyone how jolly well we all did at the LBF this year.

Here are all the places keen on getting some action from the Snowbooks list: Italy, Brazil, Israel, Taiwan, Portugal, Slovenia, Italy, Russia, France, US, Bulgaria and Poland. And it's not just Adept (!), it's also City of the Sun, The Other Eden, The Sunny Side, Idle Thoughts, Paradise jazz, Plotting for Beginners and The Edgier Waters!

Nice.  <br/><h4></h4>
