Before I moved to the countryside, and lived beside open wheat fields, I'd never heard of thrips. They're tiny little black insects, like a barely noticeable snip of black thread, but around this time of year they exit the wheat fields in their billions and make a nuisance of themselves. They wiggle their way into LCD displays (I have a couple with permanent black dots inside them), into picture frames and land on your skin, moving around just enough to make you itch. They're easy enough to pick off but there are so many of them. And the outsides of my windows at this moment contain hundreds of them, queued up and waiting to get in. Hopefully if I stay indoors, under a blanket, I'll be OK. See you again once it starts getting frosty.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
