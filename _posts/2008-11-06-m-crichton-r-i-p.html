There's a very measured obituary for Michael Crichton, who I'm sure you know has just passed away, in the New York Times. It hits all the points I would have made, about how he couldn't write relationships but he <em>could </em>sneak in lots of little lectures so that you came away a little brainier (except when his wild speculations got the better of him). Bizarrely, I think my favourite Crichton novel was the lesser-known <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Airframe-Michael-Crichton/dp/0099556316/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225998975&sr=8-1">Airframe </a>simply because I learned so much about airplanes and their failings. I'm not sure if this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/books/06appr.html">NYTimes link</a> will work or whether you'd have to register (which is free, but I'm sure you wouldn't want the hassle). It starts, thus: "<span style="font-family: courier; color: #606060;">Michael Crichton, who died on Tuesday at the age of 66, was like a character in a Michael Crichton novel. He was unusually tall (6 feet 7 inches), strikingly handsome and encyclopedically well informed about everything from dinosaurs to medieval banquet halls to nanotechnology. As a writer he was a kind of cyborg, tirelessly turning out novels that were intricately engineered entertainment systems. No one - except possibly Mr. Crichton himself - ever confused them with great literature, but very few readers who started a Crichton novel ever put it down.</span> <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
