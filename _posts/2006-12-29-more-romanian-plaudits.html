Hey, I missed this! You remember that The Romanian was included in the Guardian's best of 2006 roundup. Well now that nice Paul Burston, author and Time Out gay and lesbian editor, included The Romanian in his picks of 2006 in the Independent. In the Boxing Day edition he writes: 

"Bruce Benderson's The Romanian (Snowbooks): Benderson's painfully candid memoir reads like a modern-day De Profundis, with Wilde's Bosie replaced by an impoverished Romanian."
