Allow me to genuflect in Mr Godin's direction and link to a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080305-reznor-makes-750000-even-when-the-music-is-free.html">news item</a> that supports <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/03/the-live-music.html">his recent advice to the music biz</a>. Check this out: <span style="color: gray; font-family: courier;'">"Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails made headlines again this week as he released his new, four-part instrumental album Ghosts I-IV, at a variety of price points, including a $300 super-deluxe package. He's also giving away Ghosts I at no charge, even throwing the tracks up on The Pirate Bay for anyone to download. And it appears to be working quite well for Reznor, who has managed to sell all 2,500 copies of his $300 package without major label backing or much in the way of splashy marketing. If Reznor's earlier experiments in digital distribution failed to recoup their costs, he's clearly learned his lesson: grossing $750,000 in the space of three days isn't a bad haul for any businessperson."</span> Give it away for free and you can still make money from your most rabid, slathering fans. I have to say I'm intrigued by the possibility of books moving to a similar model, where luke-warm success with a million fans is worth very little, but total worshipful allegiance from a thousand might be enough to keep you in typewriter ribbon and correcting fluid (the retro writer's tipple of choice). My pal Jenn, who already <a href="http://jennashworth.blogspot.com/2008/02/essentials-for-life-project-photoshoot.html">swaps stories for groceries</a> is way ahead of us here.  <br/>Rob
