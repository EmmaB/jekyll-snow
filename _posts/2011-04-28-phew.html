Hooray. Spent the afternoon with Ro in hospital today having a post-op hearing test. I'm sooo relieved to report that he has tip-top hearing. They know that because he successfully looked in the direction of a speaker when it hummed. I could have saved us all a trip. Hopefully we haven't picked up any superbugs whilst we were there [washes hands for 15th time]. 

Happy bank holiday wedding weekend, all. I might have something interesting to show you by Tuesday. Or I might not. See how it goes.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
