Two recent pieces of news from Snowbooks towers, with our eyes now firmly fixed on next year's exciting list:

<img src=http://www.snowbooks.com/thevalley/images/cover.jpg alt="The Valley" width=165 height=251 align=right hspace=10 vspace=10><a href=http://www.snowbooks.com/valley.html><i>The Valley</i></a> is the second novel from Snowbooks by J.D. Landis, the acclaimed author of the bestselling <a href=http://www.snowbooks.com/longing.html><i>Longing</i></a>. Set in the very real, but now vanished, location of Swift River Valley in Massachusetts, which was flooded to make a reservoir in the 1930s, this stunning gothic novel tells of the events following the young, imaginative Sarianna's arrival in the home of Reverend Jeremy Treat, a man of deep and rich faith trying to hold together a scattering congregation.

<i>The Valley</i> has just gone off to print, and to celebrate the lead up to publication on January 2nd, we've launched a special, dedicated website, where you can read an extract from the book, an interview with the author, and find out more about the extraordinary background to this tale. It's all <a href=http://www.snowbooks.com/thevalley>right here</a>.

Our second piece of news is the release of the cover for Bruce Benderson's memoir <i>The Romanian</i>, due for publication in May. Already published in France to great acclaim, where it became the first book by a non-French author to win the prestigious Prix de Flore, and shortly to be published by Penguin in the US, Snowbooks is proud to be publishing this landmark work by a truly extraordinary writer. Check out the <a href=http://www.snowbooks.com/romanian.html>preview here</a>, and come back soon for more info.  <br/><h4></h4>
