I am going to buy 2000 ziplock plastic bags, buy a stamp and some waterproof ink and stamp 'SnowBubble' on the outside, then sell them at a pound a pop to people whose only argument about ebooks seems to be 'ah, but what if you drop it in the bath?' 

I am still working on a money-spinning solution to the only slightly more retarded 'ah, but what if you sit on it in the car' argument. Some sort of pneumatic or spring-based device, perhaps.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
