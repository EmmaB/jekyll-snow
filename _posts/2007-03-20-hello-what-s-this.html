So 6.45am this morning saw James and I huddled outside Waterstone's Oxford Street, meeting to assemble the window display that Waterstone's have very, very kindly allowed us to have. What a result! I 'helped' by taking photos:

The salute of victory!

The proud designer/editor/marketeer/typesetter/production manager surveys a good morning's work:
