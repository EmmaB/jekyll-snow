If the world wants to prove to me it is a good and sensibly-run sort of a place, it will find this woman a fantastic job riiiiggghhht...... now!

I am talking, of course, about this story: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/transport/Story/0,,2217697,00.html">Career of tube voiceover woman hits buffers after online jokes misfire</a>. Just <a href="http://www.emmaclarke.com/fun/mind-the-gap/spoof-london-underground-announcements">look</a> at the wonderful fake announcements she's created. Or go <a href="http://209.85.135.104/search?q=cache:http%3A//www.emmaclarke.com/fun/mind-the-gap/spoof-london-underground-announcements">here</a>, into Google's cache, and take a look, if her site is still inundated with curious visitors. Or try <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/66883/The-Voice-of-the-Underground-is-silenced">here</a>.

<em>Update</em>:

I like this lady even more now that I've read her <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/emma_clarke/2007/11/mind_the_gaffe.html">comments</a> in the Guardian. Apparently she's had so much press today that she hasn't really had a chance to eat anything, the kids are grumbling about being neglected and she's feeling a bit clammy. There's down to earth for you. <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
