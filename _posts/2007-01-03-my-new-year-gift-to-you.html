Sick of those calendars that tell you all that pointless information like phases of the moon, public holidays and saint's days? Tired of all that excess detail like 'days' and 'weeks'? Bored of space to write things down? Rather have a calendar with no extraneous information on it other than the publication dates of Snowbooks' 2007 titles? Your wish has come true!
