Supposedly a picture is worth approx 1k words. That may or may not be an accurate assessment, but I can vouch for the fact that the right picture can trigger a whole cartload of ideas - a whole screenplay of them in fact. When I look at these I can imagine them as stills from a cool sci-fi film - one I'd like to see, if it existed. <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5600272/photoshop-time-portals-to-world-war-ii">Take a look</a>. It's modern colour photographs of iconic locations with photoshopped portals opened into dramatic, B&W moments from the past. [<a href="http://sergey-larenkov.livejournal.com/">source</a>] <hr/>
