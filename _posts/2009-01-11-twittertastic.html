Did you know that this blog feeds our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/snowbooks">Twitter account</a>, so every time there's a new post the first 140 characters plus a link to the rest appears. Amazingly we have 165 followers. It's interesting because unlike this blog I have no idea who's reading as so few of you comment. With Twitter I can view the profiles of people. You're a varied bunch, and I note a number of authors among you. Make sure you submit your work to us, especially horror and fantasy, as we're actively looking. 

Twittering also means that I must endeavour to make the first 140 characters more interesting. Hmm. That's like someone pointing at you and shouting 'Be funny!' Too late for this post, anyway. 

In summary: hello Twitterers!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
