He is a formidable PR person, featuring as he does in this high-profile <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/docs/Community/Featured/author-tattoos.shtml">Abe Books feature</a> on authors with tattoos. 

Hey - have you bought his books yet? Author and Snowblog reader Richard Wright thinks they're "bloody brilliant" (and I love your <a href="http://www.richardwright.org/?p=128">new-look site</a>, Richard! Can't beat Wordpress for style.) 

Visit Mike's shiny new <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/author_McBride.html">author page </a>and buy his books! I made those Paypal buttons especially for you ... And if you don't, I'll post more boring posts on bibliographic data...  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
