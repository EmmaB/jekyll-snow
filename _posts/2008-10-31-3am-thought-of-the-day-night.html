3am does seem to be the time when I do my thinking, nowadays. Today's item: last night at 3am I was looking out of the window at the stars while feeding Rowan, and it struck me that even though stars are superhot boiling balls of angry, firey hydrogen, they burn in absolute silence (there's nothing for sound waves to exist in). It seems strange, and poetic.

<em>Rob's comment:</em> There's a knack to choosing pictures that enhance the mood of a blog post. This is not one of my best efforts.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
