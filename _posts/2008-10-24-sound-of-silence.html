I always thought I was a bit slow for needing absolute, complete silence to work. I mean, to properly work, not to answer emails and do bookkeeping. At school I could never listen to music if I had a hope of taking anything in. In my first jobs, I would have to find ways to stick my fingers in my ears, subtley, if I wanted to concentrate on anything. Now, of course, I work mainly from home in the countryside where the only sound is of the wind and the birds and Rowan breathing (and the occasional tractor.) So I liked <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/oct/23/workandcareers">this piece </a>in the Guardian today. Hear hear (heh).  <br/>Emma
