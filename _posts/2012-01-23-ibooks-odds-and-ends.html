Just to wrap up my recent (<a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2012/01/books_that_teach.html">1</a> and <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2012/01/ibooks_caveats.html">2</a>) focus on the new iBooks 2.0 interactive textbook launch there are two snippets to add. 
<img src="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/SnowBullet.gif"/> You might not have to upgrade to the latest version of the Mac OS to use iBooks Author after all. Supposedly it's for Lion only, but tech-minded tinkerers seem to have got it to work with Snow Leopard. See <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/20/install-ibooks-author-on-mac-os-x-10-6-8-snow-leopard/">here</a> for the fiddly details.
<img src="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/SnowBullet.gif"/> Apparently the EULA that comes with iBooks Author is the most greedy, grabby agreement of its kind according to someone who examines them for a living. See <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/apples-mind-bogglingly-greedy-and-evil-license-agreement/4360">here</a>. Apparently it attempts to control what you can do with the documents you create. People have likened it to trying to control what you can do with a Word document you write.

All in all, Apple seem to have taken a great idea - bring the world interactive textbooks - and done a slightly sleazy, short-sighted and tight-fisted job of it.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
