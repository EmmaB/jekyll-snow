...and 1% female, which is a more definitive score than I'd expected. I went <a href="http://www.mikeonads.com/2008/07/13/using-your-browser-url-history-estimate-gender/">here</a> and clicked on the button. A script ran, which analysed the history of websites I'd visited and worked out whether I was male or female. Clearly, when I've got a browser in front of me, I'm not in touch with my feminine side.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
