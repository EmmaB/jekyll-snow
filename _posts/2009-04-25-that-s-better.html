I was grumbling a bit at how hard the London Book Fair was: lots of travelling, seven hours of standing up... the need to smile. But then I've just read what my friend Verity was <a href="http://atraineewarden.blogspot.com/2009/04/research-dagging-and-ewe-feed.html">doing yesterday</a> on her little island and I no longer have any complaints.
