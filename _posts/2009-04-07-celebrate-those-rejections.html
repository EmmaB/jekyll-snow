I wrote a <a href="http://strictlywriting.blogspot.com/2009/04/guest-blog-by-emma-barnes-why-its-good.html">guest post </a>on why you should be glad to be rejected, some of the time. 

I hope that link works. The last two I've done have had to be fixed by Rob. Three would be beyond the pale.  <br/>Emma
