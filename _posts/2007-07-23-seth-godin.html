I read <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/">Seth Godin's blog</a>, and I have to say it puts the fear of god in me. He always recommends the exact opposite of what I'm doing. Today's advice, regarding blogs: 

"Strangers want to read about their lives, not yours." 

Oops. Minus one point, again.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
