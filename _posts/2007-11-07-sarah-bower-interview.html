Sarah Bower has done a lovely interview on Wayland radio (thanks to Dave from the show for posting me a copy). It's well worth a listen for some fascinating insights into the genesis of The Needle in the Blood - as well as for the jolly leprechaun music that appears out of nowhere around the ten minute mark. Sarah also reads a passage. <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Track01.cda">Right mouse and select 'save as'</a> to download the file.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
