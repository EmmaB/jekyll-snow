I have written a piece for The Bookseller on this weekend's IPG conference. You can <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/blogs/54543-where-the-top-brass-speak.html">read it here.</a> Thanks to Rob for helping me to edit it from something florid and overwrought to something a lot... better.  <br/>Emma
