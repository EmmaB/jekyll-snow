416 - is the number of images I had to manually place in InDesign yesterday
1 - is the number of Christmas books I have sent to the printer
1 - is also the number of teeth that I currently have a slight toothache in
1 - is also the number of boats that have just been towed past my window. Odd. 
6 - is the number of Christmas books I have to send to the printer by tomorrow
85% - or thereabouts is the likelihood of that happening. 
15 - is the number of requests I've had for a review copy of City Cycling and I haven't even written a press release yet
25 - is the total number of books ordered from our website so far since I put the google checkout buttons on. A modest start, but a start nonetheless

1 is the number of coffees I'm going to go and get now. 
10, on a scale of 1-10, is how excited I am about the upcoming day. Nothing particularly special happening but, I tell you, it's *bloody lovely* to have your own company.  <br/>Emma
