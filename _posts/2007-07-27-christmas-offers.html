In a shameless, direct steal from Scott at TFP, I've put together a lovely offer for any bookshop who wants to get all festive, Snowbooks-stylee. Go to a <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/christmas07.html">Special Page</a> for details. In brief: long payment terms, massive discounts and - well, that's about it, really. Good, though. 

There's an offer for readers as well. Buy any three Snowbooks for &pound;16. That, scientifically speaking, is a Good Deal since our cheapest books are &pound;7.99.

Remember, it's never too early to jingle your bells.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
