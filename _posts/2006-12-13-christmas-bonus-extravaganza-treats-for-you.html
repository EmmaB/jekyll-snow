Oh, you lucky people. 

<img alt="DarkChocolate.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/DarkChocolate.jpg" width="400" height="266" />

So, we had a chat with some VERY nice people at Bendicks-the-lovely-chocolate-company. Poor Bendicks people: they have so much chocolate, and it just wants to be loved. All they want is to find good homes for their chocolate. Is that too much to ask? Is it?

So, charitable souls that we are at Snowbooks, we've decided to help them out. And help <strong>you</strong> out too. The first 25 people who <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">email me</a> will get a selection package of Bendicks chocolate worth &pound;25 (read it, people, <strong>&pound;25</strong>). The chocolate is for you to eat; no strings attached. All we ask is that you send us a photo of you enjoying a Snowbook. Very good photos, with particularly amusing captions, may well appear on this very blog.

So... go go go! This will sort the RSS feed subscribers from the boys...  <br/>Emma
