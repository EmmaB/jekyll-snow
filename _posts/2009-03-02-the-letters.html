Here's Fiona Robyn grinning like... a happy author, with her book in Borders. I suspect that's a rather nice feeling, to see your book in a shop. Fiona's doing a super blog tour starting today, and will be visiting no less than 26 blogs. Phew. Follow her <a href="http://www.fionarobyn.com/thelettersblogtour.htm ">here.</a> And read one of the first reviews from those foxy <a href=" http://vulpeslibris.wordpress.com/2009/03/02/the-letters-by-fiona-robyn/">Foxes</a> (although when the reviewer says 'Nothing much happens in the story' I wonder if we read the same book. Anyway, whatever. I am meant to be trying not to go for the throat of less-than-completely-raving reviewers nowadays, on account of how it frightens them so.)  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
