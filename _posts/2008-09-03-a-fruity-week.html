Apropos of nothing, since Sunday I have eaten 4 oranges, 6 apples, 1 pineapple, 2 punnets of blueberries, 6 bananas and 12 vine tomatoes. I have also eaten 6 fruity soleros. I doubt that they count. And a bag of prunes. And I'm still feeling like I want some more fruit. 

Just thought you should know. Don't ask why.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
