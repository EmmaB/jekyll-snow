"<a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/archive/index.php/t-32092.html">Snowbooks are built like tanks</a>... I've seen one dropped down stairs. Thunk Thunk Thunk... all while sleeping, and at the bottom of the stairs the lid popped open, and it turned right back on... no problems... they dont get much better than the Snowbooks."
