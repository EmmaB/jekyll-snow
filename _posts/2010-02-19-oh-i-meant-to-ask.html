The Bookseller ran a piece on our profits this week, and it's subscriber only. Can anyone send me the full text? 

On that note, we've just reported to Companies House that we made a profit of 14.5k last year. The previous year was 17k, which we would have beaten were it not for 8k of bad debts from various people going bust around us. 

Yes, you heard right. We're profitable, again, in the most ridiculous market where customers keep dropping like flies. Do we get a medal or anything?  <br/>Emma
