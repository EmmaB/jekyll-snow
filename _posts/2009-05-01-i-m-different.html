No one likes to think of themselves as a mutant or outside the parameters of normal human anatomy, but that's the conclusion I've reached. I got the Bluetooth headset (pictured) a few months ago because it got such fantastic reviews, and was supposed to fit really well. But I tried and tried and couldn't get it to sit comfortably. It was either painful (and then would fall off) or dangling (and then would fall off). And since then, every few weeks I think 'but it <em>must </em>fit. I'll try again.' Whatever you can think of, I've tried and it won't fit. And then today I flipped over the hook and tried it on my left ear and it clipped on nicely. So now I know. I'm an asymmetrical mutant.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
