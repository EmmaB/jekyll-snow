My favourites so far: <a href="http://warorcar.blogspot.com/2008/08/trap-osama-in-afghanistan-with-giant.html">Trap Osama in Afghanistan with a giant wall of $100 bills</a>, <a href="http://warorcar.blogspot.com/2008/09/panda-stealth-bomber.html">Buy a stealth bomber for each panda</a>, <a href="http://warorcar.blogspot.com/2008/08/buy-ohio-state-michigan-tickets-until.html">Buy Ohio State - Michigan tickets until the sun becomes a red giant</a> and <a href="http://warorcar.blogspot.com/2008/08/one-laptop-per-child-adult-sheep-pig.html">One laptop per child, grown-up, sheep, pig, and cow</a> . But there are lots more suggestions <a href="http://warorcar.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2008-08-30T00%3A01%3A00-04%3A00&max-results=10">here</a>.  <br/>Rob
