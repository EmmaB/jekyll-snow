Was reading about how one way to cut down on spam comments to blogs is to have people choose all the cats from some pictures of cats and dogs to prove that they're humans. Apparently people prefer clicking on kittens to typing in warpified strings of text. And spammy robots find it difficult to tell a cat from a dog. Stupid robots. There's also a less PC version where you're asked to select the 'hot' people from a grid of photos. Not sure about that. Lowers the tone of the internet if you ask me.  <br/>Rob
