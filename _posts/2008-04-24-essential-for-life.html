I don't know if you've noticed, but Em is always boasting about how great she is*. On and on and on, like a runaway steam-trumpet. But I wonder, do we hear enough how about how great <em>I</em> am? Actually, forget that question. A better one is: what's that thumbnail there a picture of? Well, if you promise to be quiet and polite, you could go over to my pal Jenn's place <a href="http://jennashworth.blogspot.com/2008/04/essentials-for-life-update.html">here </a>and see for yourself. It is a bribe I personally fancified and froo-froo-ed for her. Behold my talents and their debatable extent. *I should point out that this is not actually true. Just a baseless internet rumour. <br/>Rob
