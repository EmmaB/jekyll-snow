You'll remember that one of our gang, Anna, is based in the US. The internets, Skype and her weirdly early rising patterns mean that we barely notice that she's in another country - with one notable exception: work-related socialising, or as I like to call it, Enforced Fun. So at our Christmas Works Do last night we decided, in real-world Second-Life stylee, to appoint an avatar. Here is our virtual Anna, hard at work at the end of another long day:

But hooray! The whistle goes and it's on with the Christmas gladrags, and straight down the pub for a nice beer an' a tab.

That's the spirit, Anna!

Next up, a hearty sit-down meal. Phew, that's a lot of pizza for one small panda-avatar.

Easy tiger! Table dancing *is* fun, you're right, but careful not to fall down.

And the time-honoured end to a company night out...
