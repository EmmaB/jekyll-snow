I should like to start a petition for the following things: 

- For Carey Mulligan to immediately be installed as the new Companion. 
- For Steven Moffat to write all future Doctor Who episodes. 

And it didn't even contain that much David Tennant. Who'd (heh) have thought such a thing would be even barely passable? Genius!

Please sign your assent in the comments and I shall send to the BBC on the morrow. 

*Er, not really.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
