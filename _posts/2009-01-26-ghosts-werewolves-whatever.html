Werewolves aren't exactly ghosts, but hey - doesn't stop Maneater appearing high on the list of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/bestsellers/books/274071/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_4_last">Amazon's bestselling ghost stories! </a>

<em>Rob's update</em>: Amazon obviously update this a lot. When I looked, I came across <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9781905005666.html">Paris Immortal</a> before I reached <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9781905005840.html">Maneater</a>.  <br/>Emma
