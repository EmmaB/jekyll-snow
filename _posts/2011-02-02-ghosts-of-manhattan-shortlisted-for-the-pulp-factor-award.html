I was going to get all organised tonight, and change the background of this 'ere blog page to something else. But no! I shan't! For George's Ghosts of Manhattan is <a href="http://pulpfactory.blogspot.com/2011/02/official-2010-pulp-factory-award-ballot_01.html">up for a prize</a>! And you, gentle reader, can make him win. Please do cast your vote. The book's a smasher.

On the note of updating things, the home page no longer celebrates the fast approaching end of 2010, since, well, that was then and this is now. Instead it now features a corking new short story from our very own Thomas Emson. Enjoy, you lucky people.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
