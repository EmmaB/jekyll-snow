So, this is exciting. Ro and me and Rob and Verity Ann (commenter to the SnowBlog and girlfriend of Rob, in that order) are pushing off to New York tomorrow. I have a five minute speech to give at Tools of Change on Tuesday (4pm, the Ignite session, if you're going. Cheer loudly, throw roses, etc) about how to make catalogues in 5 minutes, but apart from that and a bit of listening in at TOC we'll have NYC to ourselves for a week. Any tips on what to do and what to see would be great! I will be taking a copy of Ghosts of Manhattan which is just back from the printer and is very timely. 

(Try not to email whilst I'm gone. I won't reply when I'm there, and I'll probably just delete all 1600 emails that I'll inevitably have when I get back. Or, at least, I'll be sorely tempted.)

Think of me at 5pm tomorrow when I take my seat in Economy with a 16 month old...  <br/>Emma
