Yes, again I secretly entered a prize without telling Rob. You'll recall he finds it astonishing that I can be so busy with the normal, day to day running of the business and yet still wilfully load myself up with extra work which he sees no benefit to - other than a nice pat on the head. But, you see, the thing is, I *like* pats on the head. 

He says it would be OK if, for every trade prize I enter, I also enter a competition for something useful, like a washing machine or to have the mortgage paid for a year. Or a hamper. So soon my front yard may be cluttered up with all manner of white goods and wicker. 

Anyway, the photo is my entry for the Independent Publisher of the Year nibbie 2008 (the same one we won in 2006). I did it as a website, but also printed out the pages for the judges and put the website on discs for them. And I made my own <a href="http://www.papercdcase.com/about.php">paper CD cases</a>. Pretty, no? 

Fingers crossed!  <br/>Emma
