How does it happen? Last Monday I was not doing too badly at all on the tasks front. Now I am SWAMPED. My list, for those who care: 

- Answer 75 emails (proper, needing a bit of work emails), another 25 of which I've just discovered in my junkmail. Sorry if yours is among them. 
- Bookkeeping (it never goes away)
- ONIX update
- Blog post (tick)
- Stock check
- 10 cover designs (not as bad as it sounds, they are part of a series)
- typeset 10 books
- five other cover designs
- typeset one text book
- check two contracts
- send bunch of How to Worrys and Cooking with Boozes to Christmas journos (they love them)
- royalties
- grant paperwork
- 3 websites (one for free. I'm an idiot for offering) 
- fix car bumper (not strictly speaking publishing related, true)
- calculate sales rep commission
- printing, reprints, other printer related things
- follow ups to five meetings
- ALL THE POXY FRANKFURT FOLLOW UP that I still haven't done
- filing (ha! like I'm going to do that any time soon)
- prize entries
- sales targets and budgetting
- sales reporting
- chase some ad salesmen (weird, I know)
- phone the bank (hello, the bank!)
- complain to everyone I meet about returns
- cash flow planning
- read five books
- hoover (again, less with the publishing but still needs doing, you know)

Better blinking well get on with it all, then, bettent I? <br/>Emma
