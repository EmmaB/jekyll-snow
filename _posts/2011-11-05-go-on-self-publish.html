I think we might actually suggest some guidelines for self-publishing at some stage, but we haven't organised our thoughts well enough for that yet. In the meantime, I thought I'd share a link I came across while getting to grips with our 'e-book creation workflow' (as I rather grandly like to think of our attempts to make really nice Kindle books). The link on the Amazon page said, "Publishers can also self-publish content as a blog or news feed using Kindle Publishing for Blogs beta". And the page it led to said, "Amazon Kindle Publishing for Blogs is a fast and easy self-publishing tool that lets you add and sell your blogs on the Kindle Store." That, so far, is the entire extent of my research, but it sounds like one more route to market for your words. <a href="https://kindlepublishing.amazon.com/gp/vendor/sign-in/184-3547131-5302402">Link</a>.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
