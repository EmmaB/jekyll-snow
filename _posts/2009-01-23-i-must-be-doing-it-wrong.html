Apparently, having a kid <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/jan/23/family-finance-childcare-state-benefits">costs 9277 </a>a year. At the moment, though, little Ro is a profit centre. I get child benefit of 80 a month. I've been spending 20 a month on clothes for him (hooray for Asda's 3.75 packs of 7 sleepsuits). That leaves quite a lot. I shall buy him a piggy bank, then get him to buy his own Wii, or future equivalent, when he wants one.  <br/>Emma
