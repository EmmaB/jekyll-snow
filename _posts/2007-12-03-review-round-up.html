They're coming in thick and fast - you might say like a flurry, or blizzard, or snowstorm (oh, you already got it) - so here is a round up of reviews. 

Leila's How to Worry Friends is proving popular - it's in <a href="http://www.timeout.com/london/books/features/3867/Books_for_Christmas.html">Time Out</a> (there's a nice picture of it as part of a stack in the printed edition. It does stand out beautifully - I was in Borders the other day and it positively glowed on the Secret Santa promotional table). 

How to worry is also reviewed <a href="http://www.frombumptogrump.co.uk/Pages/Books/Books_Reviews_Adult.htm   ">here</a> (note the comedy typo) and there's a super interview with The Author Herself on <a href="http://www.dollymix.tv/2007/11/our_interview_with_leila_johns.html#more">Dollymix</a>.  

And then also on FGTG there's a<a href="http://www.frombumptogrump.co.uk/Pages/Gifts/Gifts_Features.htm"> gift feature </a>of Cooking w' Booze. 

Tis the season to be most jolly, no?  <br/>Emma
