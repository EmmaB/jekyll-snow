I scheduled this post to appear yesterday. But it didn't. Oops. Slightly out of date, here's a post on Anti Plagiarism Day:

I was sent a couple of stories by a good friend who alerted me to the fact that one of them has won a prize. Thing is, it was written after its author read the other story, which is pretty much identical in every way that matters - story, form, even horribly similar sounding character names. 

Plagiarism is dreadful. Read the comments on <a href="http://howpublishingreallyworks.blogspot.com/2009/07/anti-plagiarism-day-friday-17-july.html">this post </a>to see one author's reaction when she discovered her work had been plagiarised. And visit <a href="http://howpublishingreallyworks.blogspot.com/">How Publishing Really Works</a> today who have named today anti-plagiarism day.  <br/>Emma
