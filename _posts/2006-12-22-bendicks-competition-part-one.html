I had to leave the office at noon today because Kogan Page (who we rent space from) shut up shop early (it's only Christmas; what's the fuss? Humbug - should have stayed open even later. Er, not really), and I ran out of time to do everything I wanted, including to post the photos that people kindly sent in for the Bendicks Chocolate competition. And wouldn't you just know it - I can't access all the photos from home over my webmail thing - and I've turned my office pc off to save leccy over the break so I can't log in remotely. Doh. So here is a first installment of some of the excellent photos we received and the rest will follow when I'm back in the office.

Oddly enough there seemed to be a disproportionately high number of cats who enjoy our books. You know it's only a matter of time before we publish one of those '100 Ways To Tell Your Cat I Love You' books...

At the top going to huge effort - a sign! A Snowman! are the marvellous <a href="www.castlehillbookshop.co.uk ">Castle Hill Book Shop</a> who even have a snowbooks link on their website to all our books, lord love 'em. That there in the middle is <a href="http://dovegreyreader.typepad.com">DoveGreyReader</a> herself. And then there's a couple of rascals at the bottom. 

Thanks to those who entered - your chocolate should be with you by now! Enjoy!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
