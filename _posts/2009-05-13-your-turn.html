You've heard me grumble and pontificate about the U.S. TV show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollhouse_TV_series">Dollhouse</a>, but if you live outside the U.S. and you're not all internet-savvy, like what I am, you probably won't have seen it. I mentioned this a while back, but if you're as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Whedon</a>-obsessed as I am, you might like a reminder that it's premiering in the UK on the Sci-Fi channel at 9pm this Tuesday (the 19th). So now you can start forming your own opinions/theories/complaints instead of relying on mine.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
