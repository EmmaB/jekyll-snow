I've had a mini-idea. I'd like to invite any writers who may be reading to submit some of their work for the express purpose of showcasing - ahem, *snow*casing - it on this blog. 

Lots of people read this blog, as I discover when I go to events and people who I didn't know read it say 'Hi Emma! Love the blog!" (=unnerving but nice) and most of them work in publishing. If you'd like to have some of your writing showcased here, you have to be happy to post your email address, too (we can do the clever [at] thing to avoid spam). Who knows: if a publisher or agent is reading and likes your work, they might email you. Can't hurt, can it? 

//update// <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/snowcase.html">Guidelines for submission here</a>!// If you don't want your real email address to go up, you can always open a temporary hotmail account for the purpose, and set up email forwarding. 

I won't promise to post everything I get, but if you're interested, you should email me (<a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">emma@snowbooks.com</a>) with:

** - 500 words of your work. Doesn't have to be the first chapter, but I always think that's a good idea. But it's entirely up to you.
- the title of the work
- what the work is e.g. novel, short story, 600,000 word epic
- a hook line - no more than 25 words. Yup - 25! 
** - an email address you're happy to have posted
** - the name - real or pseudoymn - you'd like to be associated with the work
- a very brief bio - no more than 25 words. 
- if you want, you can send an image to be posted alongside the work. A .jpg is fine - I'll format it to fit. 

The ones marked with a ** are mandatory. The others - well, if you omit them it's a shame, but not a disater.

Fire away! <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
