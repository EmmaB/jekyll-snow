I'm a bit tied up with non-Snowbooks things at the moment but I thought I'd share a headline that I spotted on the front cover of Yours Magazine. It's not one of my regular reads, but maybe I'll make an exception for this edition. The headline offers a 'Real Life' interview with someone who claims, "I Helped Britain's Tallest Horse Find Love."  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
