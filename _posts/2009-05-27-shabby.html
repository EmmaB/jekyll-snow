Bad Lulu. They have miscommunicated in the worst way to their customers - by making it look like their books have been singled out for special treatment when the opposite is true. I got this email this morning: 

<em>"Dear Lulu Author, 
Congratulations, your book has been selected for listing on Amazon.com's Marketplace!  As a result, your book will now be easily found on the world's largest online bookseller.
There will be some differences between your listing on Lulu and your listing on Amazon.  Amazon charges a fee to list your book, and in order to cover that cost your book will be listed with a 30% markup; however your royalty will remain the same, and your book's price on Lulu will not change.  Furthermore, your book sales on Amazon will reflect in your Lulu account immediately. 

Lulu is committed to helping you increase your book's sales and we hope you enjoy the benefits of listing your book on Amazon.com. 
Kind regards, 

Lulu"</em>

Then throughout the day I have received now fewer than five emails from excited authors who write to tell me that their self published book, which they have currently got on submission to us, has been selected by Amazon. 

Sadly, this is a generic email. Nothing's been 'selected'. And Lulu should realise that they're messing with people's heads if they pretend otherwise. If I can find the time I'm going to switch providers as a result of this. Decentness Fail. <br/>Emma
