Yes, the rumours are true. Snowbooks are thoroughly chuffed to announce that we now have a grand, whiz-bang, fully interactive and rather pretty presence in the much-discussed online world Second Life.

Some of us have been playing around in Second Life for a while, but we thought that with all the recent hullabaloo it was about time we actually got involved, so please trip over to <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/secondlife">www.snowbooks.com/secondlife</a> where you can find out all about our new bookstore, or, if you're already a Second Life user, just <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/secondlife/link.html">click here</a> to teleport over. See you all there!  <br/><h4></h4>
