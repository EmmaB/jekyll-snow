<a href="http://www.fictionuncovered.co.uk/review/the-red-men/">Here's</a> a very fine review of <a href="https://snowbooks.bibliocloud.com/webs/162">The Red Men</a>.  We published it in 2007, would you believe. It sports one of the most technically challenging covers we've ever done - all the yellow lines are in gold foil. You can just imagine the poor man in a blue boiler suit, down at the printers, mopping his brow, puffing and muttering something about not being able to change the laws of physics. The book was shortlisted for the Arthur C Clarke award in 2008 - well worth a read. (The agent nabbed back the ebook rights so I can only direct you to the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Men-Matthew-Abaitua/dp/190500558X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326792881&sr=8-1">printed version</a>.)  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
