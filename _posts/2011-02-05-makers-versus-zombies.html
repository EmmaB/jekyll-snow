<a href="http://makezine.com/">Make Magazine</a> is excellent. They always have an ingenuity competition with each edition and the latest one reminds me a lot of <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/12/outsmarting_a_zombie.html#more">the post</a> I wrote a little while back about how <em>surely</em> engineers worth their salt could outsmart a few zombies. Click <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/MakeShiftZombieComp.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/MakeShiftZombieComp.html','popup','width=1426,height=895,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">here</a> for a pop-up detailing the parameters of this month's challenge. I think you might have to be a subscriber to enter the competition, though. That said, if you have any interest in making things or seeing what others make, I recommend becoming a subscriber.
