You know when you've been hill walking for a weekend, and when you shut your eyes at night all you can see is maps? All I can see when I shut my eyes is piles of slipcases:

A few weeks back, the author of The Affinity Bridge, George Mann, came over and signed and numbered, like a true pro, 500 copies.

Then, once all the necessaries had all been delivered (from Newcastle! America! Hong Kong! Yeovil! A truly international project) I set to assembling. First, remove the specially minted brass coins from their annoying plastic wallets:

I really feel for pirates, sometimes. Managing all those gold coins is tricky.

Next, insert coins into darling velvet pouches:

Finally, assemble book/coin/pouch/slipcase combo:
