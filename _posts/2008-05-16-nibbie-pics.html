Lovely Mostly Books picked up the Nibbie for best new indie bookshop this week, and have a very thorough and professional write up of the night on their blog, complete with pictures including one of my staring at my toes as I accepted our XSL award. <a href="http://mostly-books.blogspot.com/2008/05/come-see-our-nibbie.html">Read it here </a>and pass on your congrats whilst you're there as they, along with Mr B's who got best indie, are very worthy winners.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
