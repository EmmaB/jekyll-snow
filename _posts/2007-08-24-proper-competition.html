...with a proper prize! Ages ago Andy bought tickets for the Globe. Since then, London has surpassed itself on the manky front and we have decided to up sticks to the sticks. We have no desire to come back from the lovely, lush, green countryside on Saturday 15th September to see Love's Labours Lost at the globe. Which means, lucky people, that you are in with a chance to win those tickets!

(Cue circus music)

Yes, roll up, roll up ladies and gentlemen. Two tickets, priced at &pound;32 each, could be yours! All you have to do is <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">email me</a> the answers to these questions. If more than one person gets them right, there will be a draw. 

1) What is the name of the company who makes The Red Men?
2) What is David Muirhead's degree?
3) Where does Sally Howe's husband go for a year? 
4) Jeff Lint wrote "I Blame Ferns".  Name two more of his works. 
5) Who was the Duke of Normandy's brother? 
6) Who are the Jinn? 
7) Name one magazine founded by Richard Ballantine.  
8) Where was Linda Cockburn born? 
9) Name two books written by Carol Anne Davis
10) Where is Eden's Meadow? 


-----------------------

Update, later, after zero emails.
Ok, that's too many questions. Just answer these: 

1) What is the name of the company who makes The Red Men?
3) Where does Sally Howe's husband go for a year? 
5) Who was the Duke of Normandy's brother? 

Although if you can answer them all you are raised to the status of Extremely Knowledgeable Snowbooks Fan and I will send you a rosette. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
