There shine brightly two super things this week: firstly, <a href="http://www.robwillreview.com/?p=3539">this review</a> of George Mann's forthcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ghosts-Manhattan-George-Mann/dp/1906727163/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1266238705&sr=8-1">Ghosts of Manhattan</a> and secondly an endorsement of Mark Hodder's forthcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spring-Heeled-Jack-Burton-Swinburne/dp/1906727201/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1266238775&sr=1-4">Spring Heeled Jack</a> from none other than Michael Moorcock (Michael Moorcock!) who says "This is the best debut novel I have read in ages". Click below for the full glowing review. 
Imagine you're me and you started a company a few years back, and stuff happened, time passed, and then seven years later you get a review like that for a book you're publishing from a childhood hero. Chuffed doesn't begin to cover it. 

Oh yes, and I'm going to New York next week. With Ro. Whee! "This is an exhilarating romp through a witty combination of 19th century English fact and fiction.  Mark Hodder definitely knows his stuff and has given us steam opera at its finest.  In this first novel he shows himself to be as clever and inventive a writer as those who enliven his pages. We follow English explorer and eroticist (and King's agent) Sir Richard Francis Burton, poet and Sadean Algernon Charles Swinburne and a cast including Florence Nightingale, Charles Darwin, Francis Galton and Isambard Kingdom Brunel  (rather different to those known to our Victorian ancestors) as well as the mysterious albino Laurence Oliphant in an adventure involving the very nature of Time itself in a London filled with steam-horses and velopicides where were-wolves prowl the streets and 'Spring-Heeled Jack', star of the Penny Dreadfuls, might provide the key to an ever-deepening mystery. A great, increasingly complex, plot, fine characters and invention that never flags! It gets better and better, offering clues to some of Victorian London's strangest mysteries.  This is the best debut novel I have read in ages." -- Michael Moorcock <br/>Emma
