<p>Might I recommend to you all <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Cut-Down-a-Tree/">some instructions</a> I read today in an old issue of <a href="http://www.makezine.com/">MAKE magazine</a> about how to cut down a tree. I'm not planning to cut one down, but if I ever did, now that I've read these instructions I think the chances of me dying will have been roughly halved. That's down from starting odds of about 100% (though it's probably best to ignore the article's first bit of advice).</p>

<p>Click on the picture above for the whole thing, but here's the jolly way in which it starts::</p> <span style="font-family: courier; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><p>Warning! Get really drunk first. Then it won't hurt so much when you chainsaw your face off and crush your family.</p>

<p>First step - find a tree to cut down. No problem. As soon as you know how to cut down a tree people will sense it and constantly ask you to cut down trees for them.
It will help if you know some of the technical vocabulary:</p>

<p>Equipment: Every piece of equipment used in this process is called a "Widowmaker".</p>
<p>Tree Anatomy: The tree and every part of the tree is called a "Widowmaker".</p>
<p>Terrain Analysis: Everything in the vicinity of the tree is called a "Widowmaker".</p></span> <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
