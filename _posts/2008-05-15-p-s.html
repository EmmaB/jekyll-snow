There was something I meant to add to my <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/05/otakunomics.html">Otakunomics</a> post. Having bought a new copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_(film)">Serenity</a>, I now have a secondhand copy which I am willing to part with for free, gratis and no money down. If you want me to send it to you, valued blog habitu&eacute;, then e-mail me at the gaudy address to the left and tell me why I should send it to you (and where in the world you want it to go).  <br/>Rob
