Back to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Short-History-Nearly-Everything/dp/0552997048/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222939474&sr=8-1">Bill Bryson</a> for today's factual treat.

Apparently dinosaurs are rare these days. The truth is that they died out long before <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Does_Sarah_Palin_believe_that_dinosaurs_were_alive_4000_years_ago">Sarah Palin</a>'s hominid ancestors walked the Earth (I'm editorialising here; BB doesn't mention SP.) And while they were once plentiful, now there are even fewer of them than you think. For instance, if you've been to the American Museum of Natural History and seen the barosaurus defending her babies from an attacking allosaurus what you've actually seen is a fake. More horrifying for me is that the giant diplodocus just inside the Natural History Museum in London is also a fake. It's made of plaster. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a> had it made in Pittsburgh and offered it as a gift to the museum. I've sat and looked up at it while listening to the irascible Richard Dawkins lecture. I've set scenes from a book next to it (again, I'm editorialising; BB does know about my personal history). To be honest, it's a bit of a blow. But this isn't about nuggets of comforting falsehood. No. This is about daily <em>info</em> nuggets.  <br/>Rob
