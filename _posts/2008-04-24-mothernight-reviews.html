They're coming thick and fast today. The first is from <a href="http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2008/2/15/lifebookshelf/20232396&sec=lifebookshelf">the Star</a>: do click through if only to see the layout. The image is next to a sticker book of dinosaurs and it made me laugh. (Sarah, can your next book for us be a dinosaur sticker book, please?) In fact, that page is a bit of a <a href="http://www.writewords.org.uk">Writewords</a> members' fest as there are two other books by members reviewed. Congrats to all. 

And here's a great interview with Sarah in <a href="http://gaydarnation.com/UserPortal/Article/Detail.aspx?ID=20756">Gaydarnation. </a>  <br/>Emma
