In a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080304-book-lovers-have-emotional-bond-with-paper.html">recent survey</a> by UK media lawyers Wiggin, a few questions related to electronic versus paper books. People are more attached to their books than they are to their satellite television, radio stations, newspapers, magazines, social networks, video games, blogs, DVDs, and P2P file-swapping. 53 percent of respondents said that they would "never" or would "hate" to stop using paper books, and another 24 percent said they would be "uncomfortable." 39 percent of the respondents said that electronic reading devices were appealing or very appealing, but 61 percent had the opposite reaction. Hmm. Personally, I'd have liked the follow-up question to have been 'and have you actually used one?'. But people aren't likely to use one if they think they know they won't like it. And until the technology moves on one or maybe two steps, they're probably right.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
