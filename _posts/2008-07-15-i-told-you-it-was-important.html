Bibliographic data, that is. I've just been browsing Amazon.com because I have to fill out a stupid form for my US distributors about our forthcoming titles (they don't accept ONIX messages, and you know what happens when people don't accept my ONIX messages. Bad things, that's what) and the form includes a field to note down  comparable titles. So, not wanting to actually have to think about it, I go to Amazon and browse the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1216109507/ref=sr_nr_n_0?ie=UTF8&rs=10134&bbn=720360&rnid=10134&rh=i%3Astripbooks%2Cn%3A17%2Cn%3A10134%2Cn%3A720360">Action and Adventure</a> category. And what's there in the top ten? <em>What Was Lost</em> by Catherine Flynn, and <em>Life of Pi</em> by Yann Martel. And my favourite: the audio book of <em>Life with My Sister Madonna</em> by Christopher Ciccone. 

Nice categorisation job there, folks. I would definitely have gone to the Action and Adventure category to find those books. Oh, hang on, no I wouldn't.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
