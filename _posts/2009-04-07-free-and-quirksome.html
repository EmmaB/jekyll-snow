When Leila Johnston isn't <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Johnston.html">writing books for us</a>, and doing a million other things, some of which seem to involve being on television, or scriptwriting for the radio, she puts her few remaining minutes a day not into sleep, but into editing and publishing an eclectic, monthly, internet-only publication called <a href="http://www.alltherage.org.uk/">All The Rage</a>. An appreciable part of every edition is humorous, but it's a whole heap of other things besides. It's scruffy and unpredictable and it's just there waiting for you to read it - or even contribute to it, if you can manage to not be rubbish. Go, browse, pick an edition at random and start reading. If you find something you don't like, keep looking; there's something for everyone*. <a href="http://www.alltherage.org.uk/">Link</a>.
