I was just reflecting that 'aren't you brave' is a phrase I have heard a few times in my life. It usually translates as 'aren't you stupid / misguided.' I heard it a lot when we were starting up Snowbooks, and I was surprised to frequently hear it again when I was planning a homebirth. Turns out both of those things gave me the best days of my life. I imagine I'll hear it when I start talking in earnest about homeschooling in a few years time. 

Have people ever used that phrase on you? I would be fascinated to hear the circumstances.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
