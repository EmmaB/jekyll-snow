Two small things that are making a difference today. One: I can fit into my pre-pregnancy jeans. *That* is extremely exciting to me. Time was they wouldn't come past my knees - a dark day. 

Two: I have new face cream from Andy which makes me smell like a princess. 

That is all. Hope your day is similarly blessed. <br/>Emma
