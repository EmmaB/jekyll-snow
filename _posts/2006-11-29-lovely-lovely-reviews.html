I've been quite enjoying the increasingly apoplectic opinion pieces by salaried reviewers. Sheesh, defensive much. Still, all that goes out the window when someone bothers to write a really lovely<a href="http://www.trashionista.com/2006/11/book_review_plo_1.html#more"> review </a>about one of our own books - a "wonderfully funny...enormously satisfying, well-written and perfectly-plotted novel with a main character who's as lovable and funny as Bridget Jones - if a tad more prone to a hot flush..." that was awarded 5 stars by the lovely ladies at Trashionista. Quite right too.
