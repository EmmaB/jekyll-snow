Snowbooks gets <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/culturevulture/archives/2006/04/20/pub_culture.html">a small mention in the Guardian blog</a> today, as part of a larger rundown of last week's <strong>Through A Glass Darkly</strong> event at the Wheatsheaf in Fitzrovia.

This excellent literary evening on the theme of the English Pub was jointly hosted by the <a href="http://www.sohemians.com/">Sohemians</a>, <a href="http://hodmandod.blogspot.com/">Scarecrow</a> and <a href="http://3ammagazine.com/">3:AM Magazine</a>, whose anthology, <em><a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/edgierwaters.html">The Edgier Waters</a></em>, we're very pleased to be publishing in June.

<em>And no one got drunk at all.</em>  <br/><h4></h4>
