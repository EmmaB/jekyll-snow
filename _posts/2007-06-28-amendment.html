OK, so the mysterious 'Sebastian' bent my blog-ear over the fact that our revised submission guidelines said that we would rather like to see full manuscripts for non-fiction as well as fiction. Never say I don't listen to my...er, suppliers. Presto, our requirements are changed as you'll see if you visit the <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/authors.html">authors</a> page!

Thanks for taking the time, Sebastian.  <br/>Emma
