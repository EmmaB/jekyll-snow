Two lovely things to share with you on this most glorious of damp summer mornings - which I heartily approve of as heat + pregnancy = big feet, which no-one wants. 

First, <a href="http://www.incwriters.co.uk/incorporatingwriting.htm">a big interview </a>with Steve Aylett in the latest issue of IncorporatingWriting mag (their 'PULP' issue)

Secondly, a <a href="http://www.kentnews.co.uk/kent-news/Author-is-gruesomely-good-with-words-newsinkent14262.aspx">completely awesome piece</a> in the Kent news with Thomas Emson, author of Maneater. 

Enjoy with your morning coffee as you plan your week. Mine is shaping up to be rather busy but full of progress.  <br/>Emma
