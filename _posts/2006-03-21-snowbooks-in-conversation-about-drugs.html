Lisa Carver, author of <em><a href="http://www.drugsarenice.com/">Drugs Are Nice</a></em>, which is in all good bookshops any minute now, has just been interviewed over at <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/litarchives/2006/mar/interview_lisa_carver.shtml">3:AM Magazine</a>, whose <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/edgierwaters.html">five-year-anthology</a> will also be published by Snowbooks in June. 

Lisa is interviewed by up-and-coming young novelist Noah Cicero (who also appears in the 3:AM anthology), on such topics as sex with authors, sex with midgets and how the 18 year old Lisa would feel if she was handed a copy of the book (hint: unsurprised).
