If you're importing sales, oftentimes you need to import more than one CSV file at a time. Here's a shortcut for the Mac to help you combine multiple files into one new one. Create a folder on your desktop and put the csv files in it. 
Open a Terminal window and type the following:

cat *.csv > my-new-file.csv

Immediately you'll have a new file called my-new-file, which contains the content of all the other files in that folder.

This works for data files other than CSV. <br/><h4></h4>
