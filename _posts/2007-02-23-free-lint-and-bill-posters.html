Hey Snowbookers! In a twist of logic only he could have come up with, the late Jeff Lint is going to be giving out free copies of his Steve Aylett-penned biography <em>Lint</em> over at <a href="http://www.myspca.com/jefflint">his Myspace profile</a> from Monday.

We think it's a stupid idea, but what are you going to do?

If you don't want to be absorbed into the mighty Myspace empire, there's still plenty of fun to be had at Snowbooks' own <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/lint">Jeff Lint tribute page</a>. <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/lint">Check it out!</a>  <br/>
