Hey, why did no one email me and Rob about this? It was just jolly lucky that Rob tuned in to Radio 4 the other day to catch a bit of pre-You & Yours listening*, and there it was! 

So let the Snowblog do the work of the BBC's marketing department. Fags, Mags and Bags is back, on Radio 4, Fridays 11.30-12.00pm. Listen again <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio4_aod.shtml?radio4/fagsmagsandbags">here</a>. And they have made <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/fmb_shop.shtml">two promotional videos</a> which are extremely fine. 

*<em>Rob's comment</em>: I hope it's clear from this that I was tuning in hoping that You And Yours wasn't on yet, rather than because I knew it would be along shortly. Surely broadcasting four** hours of You And Yours a day is too much, isn't it?

** Ahh, apparently it only <em>seems </em>like four hours.  <br/>Emma
