A quick round-up of some of the excellent reviews that <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005352.html">Lint</a> has been getting, if you haven't been following <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jefflint">the myspace blog</a>:

- "More fun than any other mock author biography on the face of this or any other planet... " - <a href="http://bookmunch.co.uk/view.php?id=1620">Bookmunch</a>

- "Lightning quips, memories and references to people, times and places are scantily elucidated and scarcely explained" - the wrong end of the stick at <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/lint/">3:AM Magazine</a> (check the comments)

- "Jeff Lint was a slippery character. He was sort of like a slippery eel in soap slippers." - <a href="http://fractalmatter.com/main/?p=547">Fractalmatter</a>

- "9/10: Hilarious!" - <a href="http://www.dwscifi.com/articles/show/247?category_id=25&type_id=3&page=">Dreamwatch</a>

More soon from the latest issue of SFX Magazine - available now, we think - and do <a href="mailto:info@snowbooks.com">let us know</a> if you see any others...

Lint is officially available on Thursday, although you can <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lint-Steve-Aylett/dp/1905005350/ref=sr_1_1/203-0809255-1551117?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1173700652&sr=8-1">order your copy now from Amazon</a>, and there are still <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jefflint">a few free copies to give away</a>...  <br/><h4></h4>
