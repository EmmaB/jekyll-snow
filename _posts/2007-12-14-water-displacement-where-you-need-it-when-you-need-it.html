No, I'll grant you, you can't use it on a book. Or an author (at least not safely). But the idea that WD-40 now comes with its own built-in straw thingie, that you can't lose, is - I think you'll agree - the dawn of a new era. Now the WD-40 will go where you want it - and not just the first time - but repeatedly, even after you would normally have lost the stupid straw held on with its stupid elastic band. This feels huge. All I can say is, what brave new world is this that has such penetrating lubricants in it.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
