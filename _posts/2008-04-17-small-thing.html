There's a new button on the Catalogue page (click 'Catalogue' on the horizontal menu above). You can download all this year's AIs all at once, which should make life easier for selected Snowblog readers! Tomorrow I'll add buttons to download by category, too, but now it's bedtime. 

-----------------

Update: now all the categories are up, too - so you can download all the historical fiction AIs in one go, all the thrillers, etc. Hurray!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
