You know how computers cache the last few hundred strings you enter into fields? So if you go to google, and type in 'he...' it will bring up anything you've typed recently that starts with 'he'? 

Some of my searches - as a result of looking for cover design images for Snowbooks and our Snowbooks Design clients - look downright dodgy and I am writing this post in advance of anyone stealing my computer, looking at the cache and outing me as a perv to the book industry, and bringing down the mighty Snowbooks empire. For instance, here's some in the cache at the moment: 

Swinging
Rabbit [not the fluffy kind]
Rich Arab
Circus elephant
Hooker 
haunted castle
Vampire
Scratch marks
Hooker's shoe
Blood stain
Dark alley
Blood droplet
Knife
Absinthe
Gun
Gents toilet
Lusty couple

and so on. Honestly, I *am* a nice girl, really. <br/>Emma
