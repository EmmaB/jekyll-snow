You know who has it easy? Who has no excuse for achieving anything less than 100% of his annual fundraising target? The marketing director of the Cat's Protection League. I mean, how can you say no to images of tiny, defenceless kittens, especially ones who look a bit hungry?

Which is why their logo angers me.

It angers me in the same way that Garfield angers me. Kittens are CUTE. Why make them look like bulbous, custardy blobs? Honestly, give me the marketing director's job for a week and I'll sort them out. Will accept kittens for payment.  <br/>Emma
