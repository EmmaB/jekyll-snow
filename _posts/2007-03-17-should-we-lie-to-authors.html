I'm not saying that's a bad thing; it just means that there are extra sensititivies to be taken into account. 

Let's say, for a moment, that the relationship between author and publisher shares many of the same characteristics as the relationship between a supplier and a retailer. Let's name them, to make the example come to life. Let's say the author is Robert Finn and the publisher is Snowbooks; the supplier is Innocent Drinks and the retailer is Planet Organic (one of my favourite shops). 

Robert Finn and Innocent Drinks both have a product to sell, which Snowbooks and Planet Organic will then sell on at a mark-up.

Does Innocent Drinks subscribe to the sort of values that Planet Organic stand for? They also  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
