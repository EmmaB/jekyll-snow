If <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Bryant.html">Sarah </a>doesn't mind too much, I think we at Snowbooks will adopt her new pony as our own. Isn't she utterly gorgeous? Her name is Meg, she's nine years old and 14.1 hands. And she has cloppy feet and the softest nose, I can tell.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
