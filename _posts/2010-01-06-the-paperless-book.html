Stacks of new e-readers coming out. That one above is the <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/01/e-reader-skiff-to-debut-on-sprint/">Skiff</a>. There's also one called a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/05/iriver-story-e-reader-shipping-to-us-soil-this-month-wifi-versi/">Story</a>. Barnes and Noble has a <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/">Nook</a>. Sony have <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&categoryId=8198552921644523779">three new models</a> out.  There are a few smaller names out there too, like Bookeen's <a href="http://www.bookeen.com/ebook/ebook-reading-device.aspx">Cybook</a>. And the Kindle is about to be <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/05/kindle-dx-now-with-global-wireless/">upgraded</a> for international use. Are we still all convinced that they won't amount to much?  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
