I shouldn't really offer to depress you all (see my previous post) without also offering to cheer you up a bit. Six sentences won't take you long to read. Click <a href="http://sixsentences.blogspot.com/2007/10/mars-and-venus.html">here</a>.

I've linked there to a contribution by the amazing <a href="http://jennashworth.co.uk/page8.htm">Jenn Ashworth</a>, but there are many others to choose from. Reading a six sentence novel/story/thing is something one can do in a tea break and still have time for the tea. More <a href="http://sixsentences.blogspot.com/">here</a>. Maybe scroll down before you start reading. Pick something you like the look of.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
