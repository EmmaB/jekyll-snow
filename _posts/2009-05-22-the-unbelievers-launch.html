I am truly gutted to be missing Alastair Sim's launch party of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Unbelievers-Alastair-Sim/dp/1906727384/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242984186&sr=8-10">The Unbelievers</a>. But you don't have to. Here are the details. Please join us for the BOOK LAUNCH of Alastair Sims

THE UNBELIEVERS
Publisher: Snowbooks
ISBN: 978-1-906727-38-3

Saturday 6 June 2pm
The Beehive, 18-20 Grassmarket

Followed by a guided tour of the more malfarious parts of the Old Town

We will be behind the jail door on the first floor of The Beehive  (aka the dining room).  Children are welcome as long as they dont consume alcoholic drinks. <br/>Emma
