If you want to read the short (2,000 words-ish) <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Finn.html">Robert Finn</a> story in the most recent Litro, you can go to their <a href="http://litro.co.uk/index.php">home page</a> and the links are (currently) next to all the chevrons (>>): Issue 74 Part II. I think it's rather fun, but then I would say that.  <br/>Rob
