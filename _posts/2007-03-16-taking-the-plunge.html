It's here! It's here! Unwrapping great big brown paper parcels sure beats doing your book-keeping, which is what I'm meant to be doing. 

First five people to email get a still-warm copy of Taking the Plunge, fresh from the printer. It's an excellent story to read if you've survived planning a wedding, or if you're in the throes of planning one at the moment and wonder how much worse it could get...  <br/>Emma
