Wow, that was fast. Thanks to <a href="http://cyclingedinburgh.info/2007/07/25/new-book-from-cycling-guru/">Cycling Edinburgh </a>for the great review. 

"Entertaining, informing, inspiring." 

I was particularly pleased to see that whilst "The city is undoubtedly London (it's Richard's adopted home)... most of the truths in the book are universal." Good. I hoped so, but it's nice to read. 

Ride on...  <br/>Emma
