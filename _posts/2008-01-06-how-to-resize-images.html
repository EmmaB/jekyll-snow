I told you I was addicted to this video making software. Here's one that shows you how to resize images (recorded pre-coffee so sorry about the rather slow delivery). 

<object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WDGasJVTnKY&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WDGasJVTnKY&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>

Yeah, yeah, whatever, it's saved me a couple of hours. BUT JUST WAIT TILL I SHOW YOU THE NEXT ONE! Your socks will fly straight off.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
