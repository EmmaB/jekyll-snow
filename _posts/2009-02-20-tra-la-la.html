Hey, here's a thing. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Affinity-Bridge-George-Mann/dp/190500589X/ref=dp_return_1?ie=UTF8&n=266239&s=books">The Affinity Bridge</a> is on the longlist for the Arthur C Clarke award! Who knew! I only found out because of my narcissistic tendancy to technorati 'snowbooks' from time to time. 

Congrats and good luck, George!  <br/>Emma
