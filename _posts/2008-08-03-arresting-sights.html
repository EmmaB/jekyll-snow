Just something the internet (which I have now officially got bored with capitalising) put my way. Imagine while you were out for a walk you saw that scene (click on the thumbnail for a larger version). Imagine how pleased you'd be if you got a really good picture of it. But even without the snap, you'd probably be able to remember what seeing it felt like for the rest of your life.
