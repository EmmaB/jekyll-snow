I'm secretly rather glad that the <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/manbooker2007/story/0,,2192570,00.html">Booker winner</a> is such a depressing and inaccessible book - it means my track record of hating most winners of the last 20 years is unbroken. 

I'm choosing, today, to see it as a symptom of the publishing industry's malaise. Self-obsessed, inward-looking, we have chosen our book of books and it's "a story of family dysfunction, made distinctive by an exhilarating bleakness of tone". God forbid that anyone should think reading is about enjoyment. 

And we wonder why literacy rates in the UK are so low, and why only a fraction of adults read for pleasure.  <br/>Emma
