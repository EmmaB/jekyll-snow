Lovely to see some more comments appearing on the Spread the Word site for Lint. It truly is the most deserving book on the list. Do vote for it! It's like if you don't vote in the general election and the BNP get it - vote for Lint, otherwise some rubbishy book might win it - and you wouldn't want that on your conscience, now, would you?

Vote like you've never voted before. Thank you thank you.
