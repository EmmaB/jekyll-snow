It's not easy. Read the newspaper and it's full of the bad, bad things humans get up to. Then watch a program like <a href="http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&content_type_id=57578&display_order=2&mini_id=57517">Life After People</a> and it's difficult not to feel like the world would be a very agreeable place without humans: clean seas teeming with life; cities overgrown, the skyscrapers cracked and open, full of birds, vines wrapping everything, trees growing through the concrete, the air fresh and smelling of plant life. The program was a History Channel special and I missed it while I was in the States. Fortunately it popped up here on Channel Four last night and will be shown again on the History Channel on the 28th and 29th of June. The tone is one of tragedy: all of mankind's works fading and crumbling. But I couldn't help finding it optimistic. I really must focus more on the positive. Remind me again: what's good about there being six billion of us?  <br/>Rob
