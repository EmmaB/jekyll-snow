I'm in Minneapolis right now. Today was a day of powerful sunshine out of cloudless blue skies. I am scorched a slight pinkish colour. Anna and her friends invited me to watch the Mayday Parade with them and I beheld all kinds of eyeball-boggling things. The bear in that thumbnail (click for a larger version) was amazing. And why wouldn't there be a little kid riding along on top? There were dozens of bands, and giant papier mach&eacute; trucks and heads and something-I-couldn't-identify that was was either a bug or maybe the planet. It was really something.
