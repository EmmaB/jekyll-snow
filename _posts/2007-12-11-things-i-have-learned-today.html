#1 Eating an eighth of a pound of Wensleydale in one sitting will, more often than not, result in bellyache. #2 Daytime TV is awful. I switched it on a moment ago because sometimes I feel I'm not in tune with the world, so thought I'd do some market research. I lasted 30 seconds on the Paul o'Grady show. Vacuous pap. This troubles me, because millions of people watch, and enjoy it, and I need to know what's going on in their heads. It reminds me of a Christmas at a retailer I worked for once, where the bestselling Christmas line, above all others, was a mug that made a farting sound when you picked it up. Troubling, as I say. 

#3 The countryside is very, very nice to look at. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
