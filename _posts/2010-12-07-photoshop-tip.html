We all love Bokeh, right? Even those of us who don't know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">what it is</a>. I came across a little tutorial (<a href="http://abduzeedo.com/awesome-digital-bokeh-effect-photoshop">here</a>) for how to draw some pretty Bokeh-style effects, like the one in the thumbnail there. Write down the URL, and then have your secretary get a runner to take it over to your designers. Or better still, give it a go yourself. After all, you're only as old as your Photoshop skills.

And, in case you didn't notice, Em's turned her How to Create eBooks tutorial into a handy <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/How%20to%20Create%20EBooks.pdf">PDF</a> to browse, cherish and share.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
