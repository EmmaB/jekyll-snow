<a href="http://snowsales.wordpress.com/">New post</a> up there now. Sorry for the delay in posting, as I normally do the Snowsales post on a Saturday. This weekend I was in Brighton at the IPG conference which was lovely - full of good stuff, good ideas and good people. My overall impression, though, was that everyone's head looked very large. That's what comes of hanging out with a five-month-old all day long. Speaking of him, he had a grand adventure by the seaside and was good as gold. Clever boy. 

Anyway - go and see our super sales.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
