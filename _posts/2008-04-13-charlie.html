Just a reminder that you should spend some of your time over at <a href="http://dailycoyote.blogspot.com/">dailycoyote.blogspot.com</a> looking at the pretty coyote and thinking about what it would be like to live in a cabin in the middle of Wyoming. (To raise a bit of cash to pay for coyote food, Shreve puts old pictures on the site, but sends up-to-date pictures to subscribers. So at the moment there are pictures on the site from earlier in the Winter. Lots of snow and happy coyote shots.)  <br/>Rob
