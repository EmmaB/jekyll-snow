I wrote to the Bookseller last week, as I mentioned, announcing that Snowbooks were happy to extend very punchy terms to small retailers. No strings, no ties, no minimum order, no hurdles at all. How many responses have I had? ONE - and that from a retailer who's only just started up so presumeably is busier than most. Don't blame me if you all go bust.  <br/>Emma
