Wow - Susan Hill has chosen Needle in the Blood for her shortlist of her books of the year - and whichever books win will receive 100, for the author to give to a charity. What a lovely festive idea - and how thrilling to be selected, as Susan reads so many books. It's quite an honour. <a href="http://blog.susan-hill.com/blog/_archives/2007/12/13/3408296.html?message=">Go and have a look at her blog. </a>  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
