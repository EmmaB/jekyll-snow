Now that Rowan's grown out of his newborn clothes, I can safely say that it is perfectly possible to run a business *and* look after a newborn - I have done it and it was quite straightforward. Sure, I have a superior child (heh), but nevertheless it's possible. 

The only thing is that if anything else happens, other than running the business and looking after the newborn, it all goes to pot. Last week we had visitors, which was lovely but completely threw my routine, plans and task list out. Still, all is back to normal now - emails under control, accounts done, cover designs underway and plans afoot for the next week. But sorry about the blog silence this week. Normal service hopefully resumed.  <br/>Emma
