Six years ago I phoned the editor of the Bookseller's paperback preview. I asked, rather boldly, if she'd like to include my titles. She was very nice but patted me on the head (as much as one can do over the phone) and gently let me down, saying "my dear, the paperback preview is only for the books which are going to sell tens of thousands of copies'. 

I'm delighted to say, then, that we make our debut in <a href="http://cde.cerosmedia.com/1L4966369c1c02f295.cde">this year's edition</a> - with pictures! Another huge milestone reached - very satisying.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
