Jeff Barr has written some very nice things about <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/secondlife/">Snowbooks' Second Life store</a> over at the <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2007/01/snowbooks_secon.html">Amazon Web Services blog</a>.

Jeff is the head of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=3435361">Amazon Web Services</a>, which makes some of the technologies Amazon created for its shop services available to other companies. It's a pretty massive business, but Jeff still retains an incredible personal passion for the possibilities of technology, as evidenced by his <a href="http://www.jeff-barr.com/">personal blog</a>. He's also just been through surgery, so best Snowbooks wishes for a speedy recovery!  <br/>
