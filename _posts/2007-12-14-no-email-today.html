Oh dear, the perils of working from two different places. Today, for reasons that I hope Rob will enlighten me on in a bit, our server is being a bit tricksy. It lives in my spare bedroom in't countryside, and today I'm in London so I can't hit it with a spanner. It's picking up email fine from snowbooks.com, so the web connection must be working, but I can't get access to the remote email programme that runs on it. Weird. 

Anyway, that means that if you send me an email today, I won't get it until 9pm tonight. So apologies in advance for appearing stony.  <br/>Emma
