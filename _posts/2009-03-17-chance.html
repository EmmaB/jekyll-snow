Here's a thing. The other day I wanted to check the meaning of a word and I happened to be nearer a dictionary than a computer. So I took the clumping great big dictionary off the shelf and opened it... to exactly the page with that word on. It's an 1800 page book and unlike other reference books that might fall open to the sections you use the most, I definitely don't keep looking up the same words. Mind you, the law of averages tells us that unlikely things will occasionally happen. But still, you do just wonder for a second whether you've now got a special power. So let me just see if I can do it again. Hmm, but maybe I can do it once out of three. OK, out of five then.  <br/>Rob
