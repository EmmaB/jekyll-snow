Scott Pack's been writing about Ben Goldacre's book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Science-Ben-Goldacre/dp/0007240198/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229469070&sr=8-1">Bad Science</a>. <a href="http://meandmybigmouth.typepad.com/scottpack/2008/12/on-bullshit.html">Here </a>are his thoughts. I'm reading it too and, just like Scott, heartily enjoying it. Here, taken quite out of context, is my favourite sentence so far: "I mean, I don't sign my dead cat up to bogus professional medical qualifications for the good of my health, you know." In case you don't know, he's referring to how he demonstrated the worthlessness of non-doctor Gillian McKeith's nutritional qualifications by procuring an identical set for his expired feline companion animal. Who knew science could be so sarcastic and funny?  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
