A smorgasboard of horrible delights for you today, fair readers. 

Thomas Emson and Wayne Simmons, horror writers extraordinaire (who both have books in the Horror top ten this week, which is rather super)  are running a competition from Wayne's blog - details <a href="http://www.waynesimmons.org/">here</a>.
 
Wayne is going to be interviewed by Marc and Owen on NI Community Radio Station, Shine 102.4 FM on Thursday 26th August 2010 from 8 - 11pm. Anyone can tune into the show on their live internet stream <a href="http://www.shinefm.org.uk/">here</a>.

And then Wayne is going to be selling and signing books this Saturday (28th August) at this year's Yellow Fever Independent Film Festival, taking place at the Stormont Hotel in Belfast. More details <a href="http://theyfiff.webs.com/">here</a>.

Lordy lord. Don't say we don't treat you.  <br/>Emma
