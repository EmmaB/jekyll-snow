... and what happens? One of my authors goes zooming off onto Newsnight and talks to the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/feb/28/alternative-world-book-night-plan">Guardian</a> and the <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/news/author-proposes-wbn-alternative.html">Bookseller</a> and goodness knows who else, because she came up with a particularly brilliant plan to stage Alternative World Book Night (where people actually buy books, kerrayzee idea, no?) Prolific, Carnegie-nominated wonder woman Nicola Morgan, author of our forthcoming <a href="http://writetobepublished.co.uk/">Write to be Published</a>, blogs at <a href="http://www.helpineedapublisher.blogspot.com">www.helpineedapublisher.blogspot.com</a> and goodness me, if you read the Snowblog but not her blog you're in for a treat. Preorder her book from <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/book/9781906727949/Write-to-be-Published">The Book Depository.</a>

In other news, we are out of hospital and Ro is on the mend, although he's still got a temperature. Thanks for the kind words. Last week was hell. Very happy to be home. I still have a fair bit of catching up to do, so thanks for your patience and do feel free to email to nag me.
