Sorry to be a blog hog this morning. It's like I have nothing better to do. But I just read this in <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/news/49139-guinness-back-on-the-block.html">the Bookseller,</a> in a story about the Guiness Book of Records being up for sale: 

"Hit, owned by private-equity firm Apax Partners, is also looking for a buyer for Sooty the puppet."

Made me snort into my coffee.  <br/>Emma
