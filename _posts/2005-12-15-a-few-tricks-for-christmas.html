Today's <i>Guardian</i> features an exclusive, seasonally-themed extract from A. A. Milne's <i>The Sunny Side</i>, a collection of essays, poetry and other writings which Snowbooks' has single-handedly brought back from undeserved obscurity for your reading and gifting pleasure:

<i>"Now that the "festive season" (copyright) is approaching, it behooves us all to prepare ourselves in some way to contribute to the gaiety of the Christmas house-party. A clever conjurer is welcome anywhere, and those of us whose powers of entertainment are limited to the setting of booby-traps or the arranging of apple-pie beds must view with envy the much greater tribute of laughter and applause which is the lot of the prestidigitator with some natural gift for legerdemain."</i>
