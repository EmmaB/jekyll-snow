Just a quick note to say that I'm upgrading the non-blog bit of the site tonight, which will mean it's down until the DNS settings have updated. I could tell you what that means, but if you don't know, then the explanation would bore you, and if you do know then it's redundant. Suffice to say, I'll be as quick as possible. 

As you were.  <br/>Emma
