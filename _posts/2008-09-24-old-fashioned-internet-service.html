Anyone know of a good internet bookstore that ships books quickly? I mean as a matter of course and not as a premium service. I order quite a lot of weird titles, so maybe that's my problem, but by the time they arrive I'm nowhere near as fired up as when I order them. I used to love the late Nineties service where you could click on a book at lunchtime and get it in the post the next morning. It would be great if that was somehow possible in 2008 without paying extra for it. Any suggestions? <hr/>

A flicker of interest has been expressed as to the last ten books I've ordered. A quick look through e-mail receipts suggests the following, in no particular order (it doesn't include a few popular titles that I would have picked up in real live bookshops like a normal person):
<ul>
<li>The Design of Everyday Things by Donald Norman</li><li>Kinesiology - The Skeletal System and Muscular Function by Joseph Muscolino</li><li>Behind the Seen - How Walter Murch Edited Cold Mountain by Charles Koppelman</li><li>Concrete Countertops by Fu-Teng Cheng</li><li>Shaping Things by Bruce Sterling</li><li>Genomes 3 by T.A.Brown</li><li>Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering by Andrew 'Bunny' Huang</li><li>Making Things Talk: Practical Methods for Connecting Physical Objects by Tom Igoe</li><li>The Visible Hand by Alfred Chandler</li><li>Winning the Oil Endgame by Amory B. Lovins</li>
</ul> <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
