Sometimes I think I do a terrible job of running a publishing company. There's the poxy, arsing, retarded, idiotic returns which I haven't figured out a way to stop. There's my hobby of getting blood out of a stone - oh, I mean getting sales out of retailers. There's the unending pile of admin that I work flat-out to keep on top of - for a measly salary (and if you're scoffing, thinking 'yeah, right, bet mine's lower,' then you are wrong. It is not.)
