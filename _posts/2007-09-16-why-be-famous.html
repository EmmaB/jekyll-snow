So I have this thing about wanting to be famous. Or rather wanting not to be, except for one thing. I reckon if you're famous you could be friends with people who are also famous without it being weird or, you know, stalking. So I'd like to be <em>just</em> famous enough to be able to swap e-mails with William Gibson. Oh and I think I should add Bruce Sterling to the list too. I mean I <em>do </em>really like his novels and articles. But I should add him anyway out of politeness because of a theory I have. You see I posted a bunch of links to <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/">BLDGBLOG</a> and then a few days later, William Gibson <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2007_09_01_archive.asp#6776616108783135411">posted a link</a> there on his blog - and thanked his pal Bruce Sterling for the tip. Neither of them mentioned the Snowblog <em>specifically</em> but it seems clear to me that Bruce reads it and passes on the good stuff to Bill. I called it a theory; I suppose if we're honest 'fantasy' might be a slightly more accurate term. But anyway, gentlemen, if you're reading this: Welcome. I'll write a couple more novels - good ones that sell a lot - and then maybe drop you both a line. 

(Damn, now I wish I'd written this with all fancy words and really skilful wossname. Prose.). <br/>Rob
