A pre-Christmas bookclub offer for you. Buy three copies of The Red Men for a fiver! That's right - one Earth pound and sixty-sixpence each. UK only, I'm afraid. P&P is free. (Well, free to you, not free to me.) I'm doing this deal to encourage you to select The Red Men for your next bookclub read - and then to comment on it on the Spread the Word website. If I could make it a condition of sale that you were to post a comment about it there, I would - but since that is neither completely fair nor enforceable, I'll just have to appeal to your sense of kindness. 

1.66! Bargainlicious. Roll up. Offer open until January 1st 2008.
