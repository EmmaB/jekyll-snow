And I'd like to point out that we spend an inordinate amount of time and effort and brainpower to make our IT infrastructure just so, and then we get let down by our hosting company. Honestly, you bust a gut to make sure the company is all slick'n'all and the one thing you don't keep in-house goes wrong. If you want a job doing properly, etc. 

Like James says, the hosters are trying to fix it right now... and we're standing right behind them, holding their own spanners threateningly over their heads... 

If you have an urgent email to get to us, please send it to <a href="mailto:snowbooksextra@googlemail.com">snowbooksextra@googlemail.com</a>. Sorry again for the annoyance.  <br/>Emma
