And I only discovered it by reading on <a href="http://tfpsgirlfriday.blogspot.com/">Clare's blog </a>that she had won something too. Hey! We're all winners! 

How Very Interesting has won the Best Humour Book award at the <a href="http://www.notbbc.co.uk/features/54/notbbc_comedy_awards_2007_results.html">NotBBC awards</a>! Woohoo! Congrats to Paul and Dan and the chaps. One of the commenters writes:

"I think it may be the best volume ever to be released into the crowded market for Cook books. Between this and Harry Thompson, you've got all of the essential information on PC and plenty of inessential but entertaining information too." Isn't that super? We publish good books by good people. 

What, you haven't read it yet? <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9781905005239.html">Buy it now. </a>  

(I have to say - so far, 2008 is going awfully well.)  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
