It is dark as night here and is tipping it down. Is the fact that there seem to be five times as many police out with their sirens on somehow related? Are the sirens pressure-sensitive, like car alarms, and go off if they're pelted with heavy rain? Or do the police have to respond to call-outs about torrential downpours?

Also, how the hell am I going to get any lunch? 

So many questions.  <br/>Emma
