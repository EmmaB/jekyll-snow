I just bought the thing in the picture. Well, the third that's nearest the camera, at any rate.

My old flat was made of chipboard and plasterboard and fiberboard and glue, and five years ago it was a bit of derelict ground. My new house has stone walls that are two feet thick and was built a couple of hundred years ago. Something about spending several hundred thousand pounds seems to require a bit of permanence, at least to my way of thinking.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
