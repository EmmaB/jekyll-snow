I bought a sewing machine last week, and have had fun making small bits of clothing for Ro. None of them fit, of course, but that's the fun of it, right? (erm...)

Anyway, I just came across <a href="http://www.fabricland.co.uk/">this website</a> whilst looking for nice fabric. Possible contender for most bizarrely designed website of all time in the whole world forever? Or do you know of worse ones? Click below for just one of the many startling images it features, which has nothing to do with fabric that I can see - just there for the heck of it, I suppose. Perhaps the snowblog should get us some of them. <img alt="Dancing_bird.gif" src="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Dancing_bird.gif" width="150" height="140" /> <br/>Emma
