Mark Ames, author of <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005345.html">Going Postal</a>, was interviewed by Ireland's Today FM on their primetime evening show, <a href="http://www.todayfm.com/sectional.asp?id=881">The Last Word with Matt Cooper</a>, on Monday.

It's a fascinating interview, and Mark lays out many of the arguments that make the book so compelling, including the overbearing pressures of the contemporary workplace, the misportrayal of many rage murderers as loners and losers, and the sheer greed of modern corporations.
