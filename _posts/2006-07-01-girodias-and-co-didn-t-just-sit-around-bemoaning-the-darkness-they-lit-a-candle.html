A. Stevens, the editor of our recent 3:AM Magazine anthology, <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/edgierwaters.html"><em>The Edgier Waters</em></a>, has just given <a href="http://dogmatika.com/dm/features_more.php?id=1726_0_5_0_M">an excellent interview</a> to Susan Tomaselli's Dogmatika. He talks about 3:AM's beliefs, intentions, and his hopes for the book, and it's all very worth a read...  <br/><h4></h4>
