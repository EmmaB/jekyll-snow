Because of an ongoing disagreement with Rob we are going to try an experiment. Rob claims that I can write any old thing on here and get loads of comments, while nobody much cares what he writes, even if it's clever an' all. His specific example was posting a Things To Do list that included taking out the bins. So what say you? Anyone care to comment on my current do to list? Anyone? 

To Do:

- Hoover 
- Learn Ruby on Rails
- Take bins out
- Pay rent
- Photoshop Paul Magrs' forthcoming book cover so that the number on the London bus is the 22 to Putney Common
- And a bunch of other stuff.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
