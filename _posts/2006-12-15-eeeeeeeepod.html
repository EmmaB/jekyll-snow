I don't know why audio makes things so much more exciting, but I'm thrilled to share this link to an interview with our own Anna about her book <em>The Crafter's Companion</em> on uber-famous (in crafty circles) <a href="https://craftypod.wordpress.com/">Craftypod</a>. She speaks about the genesis of the book, working with the various illustrious contributors, talking about why people craft (which can be for the joy of the finished product, and for the process itself). She also talks quite beautifully about the rise of the crafty blog and how this amazing online community has grown. Hey, and she says I am a Very Supportive Boss! 360 degree feedback right there!
