The book foxes at <a href="http://vulpeslibris.wordpress.com/">Vulpes Libris</a> have posted an <a href="http://vulpeslibris.wordpress.com/2008/10/14/extract-from-the-clamour-king-by-david-muirhead/">excerpt </a>from <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9781905005741.html">The Clamour King</a>,  in advance of Jenn Ashworth's interview of the author, David Muirhead, which will appear tomorrow. Go <a href="http://vulpeslibris.wordpress.com/2008/10/14/extract-from-the-clamour-king-by-david-muirhead/">here</a> if you'd like to see it. And there's lots else to look at there, besides mention of Snowbooks' books; there's reviews, interviews and even 'special features', but you'll have to visit the site to find out about them.
<i>Update:</i> Ta for pointing it out, Fiona. The interview is now up. It's <a href="http://vulpeslibris.wordpress.com/2008/10/15/interview-with-david-muirhead-author-of-the-clamour-king-snowbooks-2008/">here</a>.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
