At last, a vaguely book-related post. Don't you love firmware updates? No? Well, my Sony e-book reader has a <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/08/07/24/sony.reader.and.epub/">firmware update available</a> for it and another due soon. So I download a file, load it onto the reader, and then it can do things it couldn't do before. Such as 1) reflow PDFs and 2) work with books stored in the .epub format. So without spending any money, I have a more capable device than before. <span style="font-size: 80%;">(And yes, I know that it would have been nice if those features had been available from the start).</span>  <br/>Rob
