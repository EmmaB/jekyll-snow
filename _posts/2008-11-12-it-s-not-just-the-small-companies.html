Who need to keep an eye on their cash flow. It seems hardly possible, but General Motors is <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/handover-turns-ugly-as-car-industry-bailout-row-flares-1012507.html">on the brink of running out of cash </a>because, er, they aren't selling any cars. They need "immediate unrestricted access to cash just to meet their wage and supplier bills." Yeah, don't we all. My question: why on earth didn't they figure this out 18 months ago and adapt to changing demand for more fuel efficient cars? God, if I can forecast our fabulously erratic cash flow, General bloody Motors ought to be able to do theirs. And I'm pretty sure Snowbooks wouldn't get bailed out by the government if we hit a problem.  <br/>Emma
