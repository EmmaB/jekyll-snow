I have 9 GCSEs, four A levels, one degree and one postgrad diploma and I am at an utter loss to know how I got them since the internet hadn't been invented. It truly is a thing of wonder. Today I stand before you humbled to share the latest internet service that I've been introduced to: issuu.com (thanks <a href="http://www.bikebiz.com/contact/carlton-reid">Carlton</a>). It's a) free b) gorgeous and c) useful. <a href="http://issuu.com/snowbooks/docs/cycling">Go here</a> to see what I mean. 

[shakes head]. The internet, man. The internet!
