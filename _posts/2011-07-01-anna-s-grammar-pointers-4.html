Do you know what my problem with misplaced commas is?  Its that, while Im reading text in my head, I cant help taking a pause where the comma indicates, yet my brain <i>knows</i> that its wrong.  Sort of the same way I have to read the misspelling <i>definately</i> as def-i-NATE-ly.  (English-writing wordsmiths of the world: it is spelled <i>definitely</i>.  Definitely.  Think of the word <i>finite</i>.  De-finite-ly.)

Anyway, two incorrect comma usages which are like nails on a blackboard to me are commas placed before verbs and before the word <i>that</i>.

The former is most often a case, I believe, of sentences getting out of control.  I think we would all agree that a sentence should read <i>Subject verb.</i> and not <i>Subject, verb.</i>  (Think <i>I ran.</i> versus <i>I, ran.</i>)  But when you start loading up that subject with a bunch of extra words, things can get pretty confusing by the time you get around to picking a verb.  So its a case of comma-as-crutch, really.  Youre basically saying, Hey, were all confused by this sentence.  So heres a comma - lets take a breather and come back when were ready to continue. <b>Incorrect Example: The park bench that I usually preferred, was covered in bird poo today.</b>

Thats a pretty bare-bones example, but I wouldnt be surprised to see that mistake made.  You might also see it happen if the subject contained several nouns.

<b>Incorrect Example: The book, an apple, four chess pieces, and a very lazy cat, were all cluttering the surface of the desk.</b>

Its like Ive accidentally started a comma sequence I just cant stop once I get to <i>cat</i> and move on to the verb (the comma before the <i>and</i> is a separate issue and differs between US and UK conventions).  

Obviously, there are times when a comma will <b>correctly</b> fall before the verb in a sentence, such as when it's being used in a clause separate from the main subject and verb.  Generally speaking, however, its a good idea not to let too many words slip between your subject and verb.  If you find that you have to take a breather before you carry on with the verb portion of a sentence, perhaps look instead to see if clarity would be better achieved with a rewrite.

Now - commas and <i>that</i>.  They do not mix.  Microsoft Words grammar checker has but a few simple goals in life.  First, point out every sentence fragment in your document; second, suggest ridiculous rewordings to avoid the passive voice; third, freak out whenever somebody puts a comma before <i>which</i>.  So heres the deal with <i>that</i> versus <i>which</i>.

Its a matter of restrictive clauses and nonrestrictive clauses.  A restrictive clause is one that is essential for distinguishing the noun in question.

<b>Example: I chose the copy that had the least damage to its cover.</b>

The information in a restrictive clause is essential, so it doesnt use commas.  It <b>restricts</b> the noun to being only the one that fits the conditions set by the clause.  In the example above, I didnt choose the copy with the second-to-least amount of damage; I chose the one that had <i>the least</i>.  Traditionally, <i>that</i> has been used with restrictive clauses, but the use of <i>which</i> is also commonly accepted these days (so take that, Word).

A nonrestrictive clause provides additional information about a noun - information that isnt necessary for identification.  

<b>Example: I chose the mint-condition copy, which also happened to be the most expensive of the three.</b>

We use commas with nonrestrictive clauses; it marks them as asides, rather than essential information.  Heres the important part: nonrestrictive clauses always use <i>which</i> -- NOT <i>that</i>.  It is never correct to write <i>I chose the mint-condition copy, that also happened to be the most expensive of the three.</i>  Because <i>that</i> is used solely with restrictive clauses, you should never (under ordinary circumstances) see a comma precede it.

So the next time youre scouring your writing for errors, pause any time you see a comma occurring before a verb or the word <i>that</i>.  Youll definitely run into exceptions to these rules, but those commas should serve as red flags, indicating either an out-and-out error or an opportunity to reword for clarity. <br/><h4>Anna</h4>
