Click on that thumbnail, why don't you. So, that's a keyboard and monitor, Steampunk style. Aren't people on the Internet clever. I just find that Victorianesque aesthetic (when done well) gorgeous and quite needful. <a href="http://steampunkworkshop.com/lcd.shtml">Go here</a> to see how the monitor was made, or <a href="http://steampunkworkshop.com/keyboard.shtml">here</a> for the wonderful typewriter keyboard. More pics of the finished products at the bottom of those pages. The brass monitor controls are particularly appealing.  <br/>Rob
