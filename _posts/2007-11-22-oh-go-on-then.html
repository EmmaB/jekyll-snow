For fans of the idea that e-Book Readers <strong>will never catch on</strong>, <u><a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/11/the_kindle_doesnt_light_my_fir.html">here</a></u>'s a little bit in the Guardian that includes a list of features that a book provides and that an electronic reading device should therefore match. It is, of course, a list of requirements that no device in the foreseeable span of future human achievement will ever attain. Probably the only reason that I like it is that he left off '15) has to smell as good or better than a paper book'. To me, that's such a big concession that I can almost accept '3) It will be able to survive... falling completely into two or more pieces, while still remaining perfectly readable afterwards'.  <br/>Rob
