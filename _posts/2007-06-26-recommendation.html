I can heartily recommend <a href="http://www.cornerstones.co.uk/">these chaps</a> as being very worthwhile. An author who submitted her work to us, which was oh-so-nearly there, has commissioned a report from them and was kind enough to share it with me. It contains exactly what I would have said if I was more eloquent and had the time to think it through. 

Well worth the modest fee.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
