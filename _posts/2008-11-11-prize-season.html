Hey hey, it's prize entry season again. I've spent rather an enjoyable morning going through the last 12 months of the SnowBlog to remember what it is we've been up to. My main conclusions: 1) Rob is very funny, and 2) we relatively rarely blog about Snowbooks news. I am quite pleased with the second of those conclusions, because if every post was directing you to a review or a bit of coverage, or going on about how great we are, I imagine you'd stop reading pretty soon. 

So, a question: which sorts of snowblog posts do you like the best? The politics? The occasional links to Cute Overload? The publishing stuff? The business stuff? The (gulp) XSL stuff? I would be fascinated to know.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
