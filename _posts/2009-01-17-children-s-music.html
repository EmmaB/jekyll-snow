After your wonderful recommendations for baby books, does anyone have any good recommendations for baby music? I have got a nursery rhymes CD (god, aren't the lyrics violent? 'When the bough breaks the cradle will fall / Down will come baby, cradle and all" What are they trying to do, traumatise the kid?) but wondered if anyone had any good ideas for proper music. Thanks!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
