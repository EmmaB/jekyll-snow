Oh, shame. Being a fan of <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/">chucknorrisfacts.com</a>, I was disappointed to see that the man himself is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2129580420071222">suing Penguin </a>for doing a book of the website. Here are some of the facts about Chuck Norris which he seems to be cross about: 

<ul>
<li>When the Boogeyman goes to sleep every night, he checks his closet for Chuck Norris.</li>

<li>Chuck Norris doesn't read books. He stares them down until he gets the information he wants.</li>

<li>There is no theory of evolution. Just a list of creatures Chuck Norris has allowed to live.

<li>Outer space exists because it's afraid to be on the same planet with Chuck Norris.</li>

<li>Chuck Norris does not sleep. He waits.</li>

<li>Chuck Norris is currently suing NBC, claiming Law and Order are trademarked names for his left and right legs.</li></ul>
Penguin should be quaking in their boots.  <br/>Emma
