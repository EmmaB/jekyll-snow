Ooh, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/06/29/womenontop29.xml&sSheet=/money/2006/06/29/ixcoms.html">look.</a>  I'm a mover and/or shaker, appearing as I do on Management Today's list of 35 women aged under 35 who are 'judged to have the potential to reach the top of their chosen careers'. Also on the list is Alice Temperley the designer,  Dr Sima Adhya, a space scientist, and Harriet Wallace, the G7/8 global policy co-ordinator at Her Majesty's Treasury. Cool!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
