Sorry to see that Butler and Tanner has gone under, and with such<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/7369195.stm"> animosity</a> between union and management.  Makes me slightly less keen on entering awards, funnily enough. They seem to have <a href="http://www.butlerandtanner.com/uk/index.php">won</a> a lot. I'd rather be in business than win prizes (much as I love them).  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
