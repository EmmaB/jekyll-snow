Alas, I was in bed by half nine, as is my way nowadays what with the bairn and all, but a barrage of cannon-like shots around midnight proved that it was indeed New Year's Eve. So happy new year, one and all. May your 2009 be filled with fine books, fine times and fine amounts of money. Thanks for supporting Snowbooks in 2008 and thanks in advance for keeping us going in 2009 and beyond!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
