Oh! That last blog post was number 1500. Oops. We should have done something noteworthy. Oh well. 

This blog post is to say that Mslexia magazine have done a nice little profile on us this month, on page [looks...] oh, there's no page number. Well, the column is green and on the other side of the page is a big toad. That should help you to track it down. Somewhere in the middle. 

It includes nice mentions of The Book of Shadows, The Other Eden and The Letters. And Mslexia is always worth buying, anyway. 

Sorry about missing post 1500. We'll throw a party for number 2000.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
