Boy oh boy, can I recommend <a href="http://www.247printhouse.com">these chaps. </a> We're using them this season to print our catalogues and posters for LBF. They're cheap (around 369 for 1000 8 page A5 catalogues, which is very reasonable indeed), and you know how tight fisted I am, so big first tick. They do free delivery. Their website works, beautifully, and has all the info you need to know on it. When I emailed with a query about delivery times, they got back to me straight away. All in all, they appear to be a business who have clearly thought through what they're trying to do, for whom, and are working flat out to make it a success. I intend to help them along with that. You should consider using them, too! I'll post photos of the catalogues and poster once it's delivered (next Thursday, just in time for the London Book Fair! There's my final reason for thinking they're smashing: they've dug me out of a hole as many printers require 10 day lead times.)

On their website, under the 'Other' section, is a tantalising array of stuff that can be printed on, including T shirts, baseball caps and lollipops. I can tell things might get out of hand here...  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
