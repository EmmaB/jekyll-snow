You might want to buy (or read over someone's shoulder on the bus) this Sunday's Observer. I think I'm going to be in it. On a list. So look for lists. I think it will just be one line. I don't know. And as I understand it the publication is full of other information, news, and whatnot so you won't have to fork out just for a few lines about me. I think there's a crossword, too. Value for money, right there. 

What I do know is there might be a bottle of cognac in it for me. Mmmm.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
