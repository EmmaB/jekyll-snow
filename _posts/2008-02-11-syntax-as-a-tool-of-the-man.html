<p>For no particular reason, I've written the colonial pronoun <span style="color: maroon;">you'all</span> a couple of times lately. It's often written <span style="color: maroon;">y'all</span>, but all the Midwesterners I know who use it, say it <span style="color: maroon;">you'all</span>. Just in case you don't know about this, I thought I'd tell you why it's a handy pronoun and how it relates to non-standard English-speakers who say <span style="color: maroon;">you was</span> rather than <span style="color: maroon;">you were</span> (shortly before they get a clip round the ear for same, if they're young enough). You know, just in case you care about such things.</p> <p>We used to use <span style="color: maroon;">you</span> the same way some 'merkans use <span style="color: maroon;">you'all</span>. It was a plural pronoun which took over from <span style="color: maroon;">thee</span>*. The singular was <span style="color: maroon;">thou</span>.
Look at how nice and neat that makes the use of auxiliaries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was</p>
<p>Thou was</p>
<p>He/She was</p>
<p>We were</p>
<p>You were</p>
<p>They were</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then posh folk stopped saying <span style="color: maroon;">thou</span> and made <span style="color: maroon;">you</span> do double duty. They still said <span style="color: maroon;">you were</span>, but they said it when they were talking about something singular. This seemed illogical to everyone who wasn't posh. But posh people get to say what's standard and what's not**. So these days we have what looks very much like the plural form of the auxiliary, <span style="color: maroon;">were</span>, used with the singular as well as the plural pronoun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was</p>
<p>You were</p>
<p>He/She was</p>
<p>We were</p>
<p>You were</p>
<p>They were</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure many of you know this stuff, but still, whenever I hear people being told off for not talking 'properly', when all they're doing is maintaining the logical and historically well-established forms of their dialect it does make me think there's a bit of elitism going on.</p>
<br/>
<p>*I haven't seen this written anywhere, but I've just assumed this change was lead by those bilingual in French, and that <span style="color: maroon;">you</span> is an anglicised <span style="color: maroon;">vous</span> (and later <span style="color: maroon;">tu</span>). Anyone want to tell me I'm wrong?</p>
<p>**Again I'm guessing, but I wonder if using <span style="color: maroon;">were</span> for a singular was easier for the sorts of folks who like to drink claret and talk in the subjunctive, where, as you know, we say things like <span style="color: maroon;">If I were to...</span> - those of us who don't feel silly and say <span style="color: maroon;">If I was to...</span> instead. You may recall my flippant thoughts on that subject from <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/imaginary_conversation.html">here</a>.</p> <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
