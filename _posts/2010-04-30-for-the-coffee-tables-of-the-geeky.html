It's a little bit of a coincidence, but my previous post mentioned reading Heinlein books when I was a teenager. He wrote some pitched at grown-ups and some pitched at what I suppose we'd call the YA crowd now. I can remember how excited I was reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Have-Spacesuit-Travel-Heinlein-Robert/dp/034530103X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1272609986&sr=8-1">Have Spacesuit Will Travel</a>, wondering if it were possible to have an adventure like that. And last night I happened to sit down to look at a book I bought in Manhattan when we attended <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2010">Tools for Change</a> there earlier this year. <a href="http://www.powerhousebooks.com/index.php">powerHouse Books</a> of Brooklyn have produced an amazing looking art-book charting the development of high-altitude flying suits into something you could walk on the moon in. There are some excerpts <a href="http://www.powerhousebooks.com/look-inside/1003">here</a>, but they don't really do justice to the <em>objet d'art</em> quality of the book. High quality photos on black satin paper - tricky to read the white words by the illumination of a bedside light, but nonetheless a remarkable book to hold in your hands.  <br/>Rob
