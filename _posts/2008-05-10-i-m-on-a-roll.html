No posts for 3 days then two in one hour. Maybe I'm just angling for the prize for blog post 1000 (this is number 972). 

This is a post for people who run companies that are office based. You might like to know how my days in the office break down compared to my working from home days. If you can't be bothered to click to read on, the summary is that I get approximately one million times more things done at home than in the office. It's genuinely worth thinking about whether your business would be more productive if you sent everyone home. Here is what happens on a typical office day: 

8.30 Leave the house. At the moment I'm walking to work, which is invigorating. 
9.20 Arrive at the office. 
9.20 - 9.30 Chat to ladies on reception
9.30 - 9.40 Pick up post and parcels. Chat to George in post room. Go upstairs to office
9.45 - 10.30 Check and reply to email. 
10.30 - 11.30 Get nobbled by someone in the office (I share with Kogan Page and do a spot of PubServ work for them, so there's usually something going on.)
11.30 - noon Open post, look at letters. 
Noon - 12.30 Go round the corner to get some lunch. 
12.30 - 12.40 Eat lunch at desk
12.45 Leave office to go to meeting in town. I'm in the office so rarely I tend to have meetings most days I'm there. 
12.45 - 1pm Walk to Kings X
1.00 - 1.40 Travel to meeting
1.45 - 3 Have meeting
3.00 - 3.40 Travel back to office
3.40 - 4.00 Do some work. 
4.00 Go home on bus, to get car to pick up Andy at 5 to travel back to the countryside. 

You'll note that in that day there is 20 minutes of work. Now compare a day at home. 

6am Get up and get ready, to take Andy to the station. 
7.20 Back from station and at desk
7.20 - 8.20 Write blog post, answer remaining emails from previous day, check rememberthemilk to do list. 
8.20 - noon Work on to do list
Noon Get lunch from fridge that Andy has made for me (I told you I never cook). Eat at desk
12.10 - 3 Work on to do list
3.00 - 3.15 Tea break
3.20 - 7 Work on to do list
7 Get dinner from fridge and heat up. Eat at desk
7.20 - 9pm Work on to do list. 

In that day, you'll note, I do many hours of work - actual work, not meetings, or emails. 

Seriously, business owners - find a way to escape your staff from meetings, office chat and faffing and you may find yourself with an entirely different business. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
