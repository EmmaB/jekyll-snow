2013 has started with a flurry of activity, despite Bibliocloud Towers getting zapped by the evil cough virus that's going around. Now live on Bibliocloud are the following new features: 
<ul>
<li>the ability to save collections of Editions</li>

<li>digital asset management master-list</li>

<li>We also upgraded to Rails 3.2.11. This was to accommodate a security patch released by the Rails core team <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/8/Rails-3-2-11-3-1-10-3-0-19-and-2-3-15-have-been-released/">[link]</a>.</li>
</ul>
The current immediate work-in-progress is: 
<ul>
  <li>Purchase order reports for print orders</li>
  <li>Massive improvements in the royalties module</li>
  <li>Writing up the overall road-map with all our planned developments</li>
  <li>Providing the option to schedule automatic pushes of ONIX data to the usual suspects. </li>
  <li>Finishing up the P&L report (you can see work in progress on the new Assessment tab on any Work record).</li>
</ul>
As ever, do <a href="mailto:emma@bibliocloud.com">shout</a> with any questions. 
<h4>Save collections of Editions.</h4>
Go to Editions, select a bunch of records and hit "Edit checked". Scroll to the bottom of the page until you see "Add to  group". Create a new group by clicking on "New Collection", to the right of the field (you can also get there from the Settings menu, if you have admin privileges). Select the newly-created collection from the drop-down list and click "Add to group". Once you've done that, you can search for that group in the Advanced Search section on the Editions index page. Then you can do all sorts of things with that selection of editions: create AIs, create ONIX messages and so on. 
<h4>Digital asset management master-list </h4>
You'll see a new tab on the nav bar called Digital Assets. Click on "Digital Assets Management master-list" and you'll be taken to a menu page. Click on the type of asset you want to look at and you'll see a list of them appear. 
The DAM master-list pulls together into one place all of the various assets in Bibliocloud: covers, ePub files, barcodes, AIs, ONIX exports and so on. So it's just a handy way to see everything in one place. The assets are still also found in their relevant homes throughout Bibliocloud: AIs are still in the AIs archive, for instance. Remember, you can store any sort of file on Bibliocloud, of any size. All uploads are handled in the background, so even if your file is 80mb, a separate process will trundle away until it's uploaded, leaving you to keep working without having to wait or get timed-out.
