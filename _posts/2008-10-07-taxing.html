I have two observations to make about tax. 1) Why are they playing wedding music as their on-hold music? Are they planning on some sort of nuptials with another government branch? You heard it here first. 

2) Why, if I send in a tax return, way ahead of the deadline, which clearly says I don't owe tax, do I also have to write a letter to them saying I don't owe tax and therefore can they give me a sensible tax code rather than the one they've sent me which would collect tax at 50%? It's a mystery. 

And those are my tax observations. I won't do any more as it's not a nice subject. <br/>Emma
