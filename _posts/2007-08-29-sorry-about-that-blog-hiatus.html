I didn't realise that moving house and office would require, erm, some effort. Last week I packed a bin liner of clothes, and put my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Real-World-Adobe-InDesign-CS3/dp/032149170X/ref=pd_bbs_1/202-2700263-5142214?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1188371939&sr=8-1">RealWorld</a> Adobe books in a box, and somehow my small brain thought that would be sufficient. Not so. 

Anyhoo, three days of box lugging, van loading and sitting on the M25 in said (unairconditioned) van later (and because Rob is my BFF, he had to lug with me - and do all the IT set up), here we are! Everything's working! Everything's perfect! Item #1: my new study in the countryside.

But what's that black blob at the bottom of the picture? Item #3: close up.
