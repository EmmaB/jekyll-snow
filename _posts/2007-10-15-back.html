Hello! Hello! I'm back! Did you miss me? 

SO many things to report, but all in good time. I am knee deep in 5000 (count 'em) emails (only 200 of which are not spam, thankfully) so give me a day or two to mow them down. In the meantime, I have only this to say to you:

I have Sarah Bower's new manuscript, all to myself, on my computer, it's mine, mine, mine and I get to read it first. Being a publisher is great. 

More sensible posts later. 

I'm very pleased to be home.  <br/>Emma
