Do YOU like new fiction? Do YOU like to get your new fiction early? Do YOU like early NEW fiction EARLY and don't mind paying a premium? And do YOU also like marketing materials and samplers of future books? Well YOU'VE come to the right blog post. 

In what I shall call An Interesting Experiment, we are making available some books and samplers waaay before publication via Lulu. Yes, Lulu - the self publishing company. I have been on a bit of a roll with them the last few weeks since I discovered that their prices aren't too bad, their quality is very good and they print in runs of one - perfect for proof copies to send to endorsers and key buyers. Since I've created these books and samplers for my own marketing purposes, I thought I'd make them publicly available, in the spirit of adventure. I have even included our 2009 AI pack which I've produced and bound to look beautiful. 

Hot foot over to our <a href="http://stores.lulu.com/store.php?fAcctID=3628978">store front </a>to see our wares. And just think: if you click on the 'buy' button, a fresh new copy will be printed especially for you. It may even still be warm when it lands on your front door mat*. 

* No, it won't be. Although if I ever set up my own POD company I shall make sure to ship the freshly-minted copies in strongly insulated packs to make it so.  <br/>Emma
