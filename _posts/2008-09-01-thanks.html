Just thought I should credit the author of the free snowflakes that now appear on the blog's sidebar. I modified them a bit, but they came from <a href="http://www.blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/freebies/vector-resources-part-7-snow-flakes">here</a>. Ta. I can't help noticing he also designs <a href="http://www.blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/freebies/gomedia-vector-pack-12-out-now">vector-based zombies</a>.  <br/>Rob
