Thanks Commenter John (and belatedly thanks Anna too). I should have tried <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> sooner. It's played me more music that I like in two days than even a good radio station would in a month... and there aren't that many good radio stations/music channels. With an outfit like MTV, even if they still did anything as pass&eacute; and eighties as playing music, the chances that they'd play me even one new good song per day are as small as a video editor's attention span. And all the stuff I've liked on Pandora has been bands I've never heard of: like Ulrich Snauss, G-Spliff and Band (O) Neon. 

If it were recommending books, though, the accuracy would have to be a bit better because it's so much easier and cheaper to flip to the next song than the next novel. But then I'd give it more info than just a thumbs-up or thumbs-down each time I finished a book. I was joking in the comments on my <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/09/wanna_get_rich_do_this.html">original post</a> when I mentioned using this technology for dating, but it makes you think doesn't it? Predictive music and movies, then books, and then maybe significant others. What, I wonder, would the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_M%C5%ABs%C4%81_al-Khw%C4%81rizm%C4%AB">Muhammad  ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi</a> (from whose name we get 'algorithm') make of it. Or maybe a man who would have just celebrated his 1224th birthday, would find having a crater on the far side of the moon named after him more mind-blowing.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
