Here is our <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/snowbooks%20LBF%202008%20rights%20guide.pdf">Rights Guide</a> (pdf, 959kb)
 for the London Book Fair, should you be interested in buying any of our rights. Click below for a technical note - and video! - on how the Guide was produced. Here's how it's done.

As I say in the introduction to the Guide: 

"This 39-page, 80-product catalogue was created in five minutes by Emma Barnes, by exporting an XML file from our ONIX bibliographic database and importing it into InDesign, using an XSL program to select the relevant information, then outputting to PDF. If you would like SnowAngels, the publishing services arm of Snowbooks, to help you make the most of your ONIX data in ways like this in your own company, dont hesitate to email <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">emma@snowbooks.com</a>. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/snowangels.html">www.snowbooks.com/snowangels.html</a>"

So you should do that. Contact me, I mean. Because if you're a publisher, I bet you five pounds that producing your Rights Guide took at least three days. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
