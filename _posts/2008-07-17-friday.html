...is yet another house moving day for us. This time we're having Men come round to take all our old junk from the London house, which we're about to put on the market (and if you make a comment on what a great time it is to be doing that I'll block you from this blog), to the recycling place, then we're having More Men come over to take our remaining stuff to the countryside. And then that will be all the moving house a couple can do in one year. 

So if you need me, erm, sorry. It'll have to be Monday. Have a lovely weekend!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
