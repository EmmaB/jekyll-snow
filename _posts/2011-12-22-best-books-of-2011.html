I love these lists. Especially when our books are on them. The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man by one Mark Hodder is on Forbidden Planet's list. <a href = "http://forbiddenplanet.com/log/recommendations/best-books-2011/">Huzzah!</a>
(And don't they do a <a href="http://forbiddenplanet.com/?tag=snow-books">good job</a> of making our books look nice?)  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
