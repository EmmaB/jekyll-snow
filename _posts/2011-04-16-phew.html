Aren't colds weird. Finally, I am coughing and sneezing this morning and it's such a relief. The last few days I have appeared perfectly well, but have felt dreadful. Example: there's a personal cheque for 1500 sitting on my piano, which is the returned deposit for my old rented house. I have felt so under the weather that I simply could not be bothered to go to the piano, get the cheque, put it in an envelope and post it to my bank. So if you've had any sort of email from me this week, or have evidence that I've done any work at all, you should count yourself very lucky. (And imaginary, since I know I've done bugger all. Sorry about that.) 

However, phew, today all the germs, picked up no doubt from the aircraft hanger full of infection and disease that is LBF, have got themselves busy manifesting themselves in coughs and splutters rather than messing with my head, so I am back on form. All the things that need doing will get done today. Hooray! I am competent once more!
