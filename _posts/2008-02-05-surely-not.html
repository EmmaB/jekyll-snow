Did anyone see the Doctor Who episode in 2006 where Sarah Jane Smith returned? And then last year she had her own series: The Sarah Jane Adventures. Did you all notice how amazing Elisabeth Sladen looked? Well, according to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0805207/">IMDB</a> she had a birthday last week. She was sixty. Sixty! That is unpossible. I can't wrap my head around it. Isn't this an exciting time we live in where sixty-year-old women have to put up with being leched and leered at by the likes of me.  <br/>Rob
