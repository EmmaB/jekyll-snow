Click on the thumbnail if you want to see the view from my window this morning. And no, despite the snow, it's not the UK. I left my camera in the car, so it's just a phonecam picture and you don't really get the sharpness of the sunrise orange/pink on glittering snow or the vibrant and solid CGI quality of warm steam rising from a factory chimney into frigid, moistureless air. In a few minutes I'm going to walk over the local Denny's and have myself a veggie-cheese omelette and most likely be called <em>darlin</em>' by the waitress. Then, later today, I may go to one of my favouritest stores in the world (<a href="http://www.ax-man.com/">link</a>). Hope whatever you're all doing, it's as much fun.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
