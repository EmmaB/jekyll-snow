I really enjoyed <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html">this fine blog post</a> about 'Frighteningly Ambitious Startups'. It's about why the ideas for really big revolutions in the tech world are repellent rather than attractive. To pr&eacute;cis: if they're big enough to change the world they'd be a terrifying responsibility to take on. It's a cute observation, but the author, Paul Graham, goes on to do a great job of explaining how you need to view the world if you want to achieve really significant change. It left me wondering what the equivalent mega-innovations might be for the world of books: you know, real departures in our thinking that would lead the way to the future. If I come up with any, I might share them here. And maybe you could do the same.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
