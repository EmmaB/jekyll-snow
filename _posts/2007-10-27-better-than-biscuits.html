Oh, you have to admire it. There's a lot to like about Stephen Fry and I posted a link here when he wrote on his shiny new blog (still with its new-blog smell) about mobile phones, paying particular attention to the complicated kind. Now he's been asked to do a bit more of it for the Guardian. And don't you just love this sort of thing? Before he can get to discussing SmartPhones a few preparatory remarks are called for: 
<span style="font-family: times; color: #091768; font-size: 120%;"> "When WH Auden produced his collection of critical writings, <em>The Dyer's Hand</em>, he first laid out a list of his preferences and predispositions, believing it right that the reader should know what sort of person they were encountering and be able thereby to form a judgment of his opinions in the light of his prejudices. I ought to do the same."</span>
I'm sure he knows how all that looks. Using Auden as a guide for a mobile phone review.  I'm sure he realises how preposterously delicious that will seem to a certain sort of person. If, like me, you are that sort of person, then read on: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,2198814,00.html">here</a>
<p style="font-size: 70%">And frankly the whole thing is a lot more highbrow than the sort of links Em will steer you towards (see below).</p>  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
