Forgive the fuzziness* (well it was pre-coffee, after all) but I thought I'd share this packaging. How can you deny yourself Super Premium Limited Edition One Time Only Get It Whilst It's Hot? I love the blatant hyperbole - and it got me to buy. It's not bad, but I have to say I was expecting better given the marketing.

Reminds me of something I was reading the other day about modern consumerism, and the idea that you can upgrade anything. Water, coffee, loo-roll - these things used to be commodities but marketeers have created a 'supertier' offering. I have a hunch that's an area of books that isn't currently exploited - except maybe by the Folio Society - but would make sense. Someone pass me the gold leaf.
