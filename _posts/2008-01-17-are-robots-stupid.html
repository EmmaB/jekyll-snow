Yesterday there were several hundred spam comments on this blog and zero real ones. That can't be right, can it? While I'm sure Em and I accept that the great internetting public have better and more productive things to do with their day than add their words to this particular lexical compost heap, I do take exception to evil spam robots bombarding the blog with their rather prurient solicitations. Time to see just how smart these robot fiends are, I thought. So I've added a little plugin (courtesy of this <a href="http://projects.heavymeta.org/HMPassphrase/wiki/Description">site</a>) to the blog which requires you to answer a question before it will accept your comment. Currently the question is: '<em>What colour is nice, new snow</em>?'. I'll be interested to see whether the tin swines can work that out or whether it will stump them. 

And do let me know if it stops humans from posting, because that's not my plan at all.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
