Re: Doctor Who. Oh dear. Today's episode I found a bit boring. Then I watched Dr Who Confidential and was really impressed with all the clever ideas the story contained and how nicely they came together. Except those good points came across much more strongly from listening to the cast and Mr. Moffat talk about it than from watching the episode. Darn. But, still. Good cast, <em>fundamentally</em> good writing - but, for some reason, staged like an episode from the Seventies. So still plenty of hope for the future. 

(Really didn't like the silly CGI graphic that depicted what the &lt;spoiler&gt; would look like if you could get a view of it. Again, straight out of the Seventies.)  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
