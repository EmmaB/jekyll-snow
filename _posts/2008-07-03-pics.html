Here are some pics I took at the weekend of my new house. They don't really convey the lovely cottageyness of it all, so I might try again at the weekend. No curtains yet, you'll note, but who needs curtains. They only get covered with cat fur, anyway. Ooh, on that note, top tip from my lovely sister-in-law - don a pair of rubber gloves and run your hands over anything covered in cat fur. It totally gets it off, first time. Genius! 

I have so far remained pretty much at zero tolerance of mess since moving in. Everywhere's stayed hoovered, folded, dusted, washed, clear, and in order, as appropriate. I've been doing the <a href="http://www.flylady.com">Flylady </a>stuff. Try it - it works. The reading / knitting corner:

My home office, featuring crazy Affinity Bridge screen saver and trophy shelf:

Some shelves. We have a whole wall of these all ready to be filled up:

Look at that shiny kitchen floor!
