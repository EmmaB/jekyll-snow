After careful strategic consideration (meaning I just thought of it in the cab on the way home) I am proud to announce a competition that the Snowblog will be hosting for the best - and worst - cover designs in publishing today. 

It is a truth universally acknowledged by right-thinking people that you *can* sell a book by its cover. This means that cover design is important. I see some covers that gladden my heart - they make me pick the book up, they clearly indicate what sort of a book it is but mainly they just work: simultaneously beautiful and functional. 

Others, however, fail. They send confusing signals about the book. They are ugly, formulaic, or jarring to the eye. They act as a barrier to sales - if you buy the book, it's despite the cover. 

So: nominations first! Submit your nominations for the best and worst covers you've seen of late as a comment to this post, with a line describing why you like/dislike them. We'll collate them, and post the images up here, then have a vote.  

Head off to your local <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk">Book Depository </a>to get some inspiration! My first nominations? 

The current <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rebecca-Virago-modern-classics-Maurier/dp/1844080382/ref=sr_1_11/026-5305192-4674057?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189146362&sr=1-11">Daphne Du Maurier</a> collection receives my 'worst' nomination. To clad books of such rounded variety and passion with such thoughtless, bland covers baffles me.

My favourite cover of recent times is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cloud-Atlas-David-Mitchell/dp/0340822783/ref=sr_1_1/026-5305192-4674057?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189146567&sr=1-1">Cloud Atlas</a>. At once adventurous and conforming (it screams 'commercial literary fiction') it made me buy the book. I also liked the way the hardback morphed into the paperback - subtle changes but enough to make the book more accessible.

On another cloud related note, I also adore <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cloudspotters-Guide-Gavin-Pretor-Pinney/dp/0340895896/ref=sr_1_2/026-5305192-4674057?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189146686&sr=1-2">The Cloudspotter's Guide. </a>And who wouldn't?
