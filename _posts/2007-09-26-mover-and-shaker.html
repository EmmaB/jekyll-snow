What a lovely day we've had today - down at LBS with a selection of festive Christmas authors to sign some books. Thousands of books. More photos tomorrow - but in the meantime, how about this? Richard Charkin has moved from being CEO of Macmillan to a director at Bloomsbury. He's going to be responsible for "growth through acquisitions, new publishing areas and international expansion." Assuming they've got lots of money, and I assume they have, that sounds like rather a fun role. Watching with interest...  <br/>Emma
