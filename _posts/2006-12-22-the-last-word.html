I looked through the Bookseller's round-up of 2006 in today's edition, and although I'm ashamed to admit it I did have a little pang of disappointment when we weren't mentioned. We <em>did</em> win that award, after all, and we have had tremendous success with our books. But then I turn to the very last page, and this wonderful snippet was at the bottom of the page:

Always with the last word. Happy Christmas, everyone.  <br/>Emma
