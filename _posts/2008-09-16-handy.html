If I get put in prison I think it's pretty likely it will be because of a misunderstanding. I spend a fair amount of time looking up extremely suspicious things on the internet. Characters in stories I've written need to convincingly shoot people, blow things up, steal valuables, conceal their identities and confound the authorities. If someone ever asked me why I was so interested in firearms or lockpicks or police procedure I hope they'd believe the answer. And I think perhaps it's affecting the way I look at goods and services. Check out this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gerber-05635-Utility-Exchange-Blade/dp/B00005A1HG">handy set of tools</a> from gear vendor Gerber. Just the thing to carry in the car. It all folds away into a neat briefcase. Ideal if you, um, break down and then, um, need to build something... See the fact is, all I can think is how it would be the ideal kit for disposing of bodies late at night. I think the next book I write should be about a group of pacifist kittens. Plus if I do ever get put in prison I reeeallly hope it's the one where my pal Jenn is librarian. <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
