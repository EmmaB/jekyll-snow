I can't remember if I've recommended Clay Shirky's book about publishing (it's got a slight emphasis on newspapers rather than books, perhaps) and the interwebs, but if I haven't, I should have done. (If only there was a way I could check, but who wants to go through all the longhand drafts of their blog posts looking for familiar phrases?) It's called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Here-Comes-Everybody-Happens-Together/dp/0141030623/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1265023387&sr=8-1">Here Comes Everyone</a> and it's good for people trying to think about the commerical future of publishing. (Surprisingly, that doesn't describe by any means the majority of publishers, but maybe there are a few interested readers out there.) Well, here* is a little flavour of his thinking in a very easy-to-watch talk about privacy and information overload. <a href="http://web2expo.blip.tv/file/1277460/">Link</a>.

*Yet again, prompted by <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/01/31/clay-shirky-on-infor.html">BoingBoing</a> linking to it first.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
