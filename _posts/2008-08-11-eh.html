I don't understand <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2535308/First-time-author-93-saves-friends-from-care-homes-with-book-advance.html">this story</a> about a 93 year old who's used her advance to buy a 5 bed house and escape some of her friends from nursing homes. Her book's published by AuthorHouse, a self-publishing business so presumeably not one that pays advances. But the Telegraph (sorry) article linked to above says she bought the house with her advance. 

Someone explain it to me, please!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
