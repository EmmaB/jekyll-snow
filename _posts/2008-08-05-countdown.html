So it's just conceivable (geddit) that in as little as six weeks I will have a baby. Could be as long as ten weeks, of course, but point is it's rather soon. Read on for the latest update on how this will affect Snowbooks. As I've said before, I'm not planning on taking any official maternity leave and will be working up until the birth. My chiropractor asked me yesterday when I was stopping, and I said I wasn't, and she said 'oh, but you'll be deskbound'. I had to admit that the only alternative would be that I'd be sofa-bound, so probably sitting up straight at a desk, exercising my fingers at least, is an improvement. Since I'll be needing to check my emails daily, this means I can't claim any maternity benefits. Anyone out there who wants to give this charitable case some pin money, feel free. 

I'm working from home exclusively from now on until at least December. 

Post: all post is currently being redirected from our London office to my home. Please continue to post any paper matter to 120 Pentonville Road. Any post that isn't redirected by the post office (you know what they're like) is kindly being forwarded by Kogan Page, our benevolent landlords. 

Phone: for a while Snowbooks' number has been my mobile, so there's no change there. However, I really do prefer to communicate via email. 

Customers (booktrade): Allison and Busby manage Snowbooks' sales. Please contact Susie or Lesley at <a href="http://www.allisonandbusby.com">A&B </a>and they'll be more than happy to help. Direct orders can be placed with our distributor, LBS, on 01903 828800. That said, I am <em>always</em> ready and available to talk to customers, regardless of how many nappies need washing, so please don't hesitate to get in touch if you need to. 

Customers (SnowAngels): Please continue to email me with all ongoing and future work requests, and I'll either get them done or ask for support from Anna and Rob. 

Authors and agents: Authors with whom I have an ongoing conversation at the moment - for instance, if I'm doing your cover design or am your editor - should continue to email me, but, when it's announced here that I've given birth, should email Anna (anna [at] snowbooks. com) if you want a reply within the week. If I'm not actively doing your cover design and edits, Anna should be emailed with all queries, gossip, updates and so forth. She'll let me know if there's anything I should know - no need to copy me. Anna lives in the US, so communication with her is email based and she's not going to answer immediately if you email at 9am GMT since she's still in bed, it being 3am her time. And it would be really helpful if all communication with me can be email based, too - not just because of Baby Rowan but because that makes it possible for us to manage the more than 60 authors we have (not to mention agents). 

Prospective authors: continue to use the manuscripts@snowbooks.com email to send your mss in. Anna is the primary reader so there will be no material delay in us reading your ms as a result of me having a baby. 

Prospective employees, work experience people, etc: you most likely won't read this but just in case you are - I'm afraid we're not hiring, or running any kind of work experience programme, unless you want it to consist entirely of changing nappies and hoovering my house. 

Suppliers: please email me with all queries as Rob and Anna will be reading my email and if there's anything I personally need to attend to urgently that they don't know about, they'll let me know. Note that our sole printers are Haynes and so we won't be interested in moving our print elsewhere. 

I'm hoping that I can take it pretty easy on the work front for at least 6 weeks. I'll be planning on keeping my side of things ticking over - the finances, SnowAngels, print, PR, emails etc - but I'll be leaning a lot on Anna and Rob, so do be gentle with them both and bear in mind that their workload will be heightened. 

Thanks for all your understanding and support! <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
