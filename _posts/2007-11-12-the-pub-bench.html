So here's an exciting (to me, anyway) project I've been working on - I'd love to hear your thoughts. I'm going to be launching a website next week called <a href="http://www.thepubbench.com.">www.thepubbench.com.</a> It's a forum for publishers to share information: whether that's benchmarking information, such as comparing returns rates and printers, or tips and insights, such as how to create printer files, how to calculate a spine width, tips on cover design and typesetting, how best to manage and calculate royalties, and so on. It's not just me blathering on - I hope that lots of publishers will join, contribute and learn valuable things. 

<a href="http://www.thepubbench.com">Take a look around</a>, and if you want to get to the juicy stuff, <a href="mailto:mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">ask me </a>for the password for a free month's trial. I'd love to hear your thoughts.
