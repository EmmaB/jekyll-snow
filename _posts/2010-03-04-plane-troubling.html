Here's a slightly troubling thing: <a href="http://www.radarvirtuel.com/">link</a>. Go there and wait 20 seconds. It's a map of Europe with the positions of passenger planes superimposed. Maybe it's just the fact that they are piled up on top of each other (not really, just on the map) that bothers me. Or that it looks like such a mess - or even like a plane feeding frenzy. Anyway, file it under 'oddly disconcerting'.  <br/>Rob
