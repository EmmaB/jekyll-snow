But before I do I must tell you about Microsoft Accounting Pro. Call me crazy but I'm so excited to have discovered it. I have used Sage and Quickbooks and despise them both for their obfuscation and lack of beauty. But MS's Accounting software is just about perfect. My god, I even did a few journals in it today without screwing them up. I set up four currencies, just like that, and amended a template so it looks just as I wanted it - easily, in MS Word! It has an excellent help file. I can import all my contacts from Outlook, should I want to. And I think I've barely scratched the surface. 

I heartily recommend that you check it out. There's a <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/accounting/default.aspx">free trial </a>should you want a tinker. 

Five stars, two thumbs up, fine holiday fun.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
