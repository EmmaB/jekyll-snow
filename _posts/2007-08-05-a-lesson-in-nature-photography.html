Still no bats, but I have learned a valuable lesson about taking pictures of critters. As soon as you put the camera in your bag you will come across, and thus startle, something interesting. Which will run away while you're fiddling with lens caps, etc; So here are the departing hindquarters of a <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/buzzard.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/buzzard.html','popup','width=780,height=686,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">buzzard</a> and a <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/deer.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/deer.html','popup','width=866,height=770,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">deer</a>. Would anyone like to tell me what make of deer this particular butt is associated with?  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
