A map of the world, from <a href="http://www.creativereview.co.uk/crblog/the-atlas-of-the-real-world/">Creative Review</a>, where the size of countries is based on the number of books they sell. Click on the picture to see a larger version. Here's the explanation:
<span style="font-family: courier; color: #330000;">Each new book published is counted only once on this map, regardless of how many copies it sells A book is defined as having at least 50 pages; a pamphlet has 5 to 49 pages. Publications with fewer than 5 pages are not shown on this map. Worldwide, about a million new book titles were published in 1999, with the largest numbers published in the United Kingdom, China and Germany. Overall, the map is dominated by Western Europe, which is home to a number of well established publishing houses. *Books titles published, number per million people, 1999.</span>  <br/>Rob
