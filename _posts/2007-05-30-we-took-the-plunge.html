Last night, Stacie Lewis' launch party for <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Taking-Plunge-Stacie-Lewis/dp/1905005458/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/202-2700263-5142214?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1180511957&sr=8-1">Taking the Plunge</a> was a grand success. Look, even Buffy turned up!

Well, not really Buffy - Stacie's best friend from home who flew in especially. What a star. She features in the novel - full marks to anyone who can guess which character. 

It was a great night. Huge thanks to the wonderful Julian and his Pan Bookshop who I left with the washing up, and Anthony who kindly supplied about a year's worth of Mateus Rose. Took me back - and it was, in fact, very refreshing. 

AND - because a particularly interesting lady turned up, Stacie might be on't'telly as a result! Watch this space...  <br/>Emma
