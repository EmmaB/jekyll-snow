So, anyone clamouring for Emma to get back to them about something or to hurry up and do her homework should be aware that she's had a very disrupted week. Emma's little boy, the normally indomitable Rowan, has had a middle-ear infection that got bad enough to need an operation. Apparently kids get these things quite often, but it was news to me, so I was helpfully fretting and twisting my hat in my hands. I think it's safe to say that Rowan has not enjoyed going without food and water and having needles stuck in him, presumably all accompanied by spectacular ear-ache, and plainly doesn't understand why we'd all gang up on him like this. Em, who seems quite fond of Rowan from what I can tell, has hardly dared to blink for three days, never mind actually sleep. Fortunately Rowan has had his operation, is mending well, is eating voraciously and is on track to be home by the weekend, if all goes well. So, if there's anything you need, you could either try asking me (no, seriously. I mean you could try) or perhaps you could sit on it until next week when hopefully Rowan, and therefore Emma, will be back to full strength.  <br/>Rob
