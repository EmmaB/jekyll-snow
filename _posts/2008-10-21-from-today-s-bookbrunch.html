BookBrunch being a new and excellent news service from industry journo greats Liz Thomson & Nic Clee:

"Fair Director Juergon Boos believed that there was one simple explanation [for a growth in visitor numbers this year]: "Digitisation draws people to Frankfurt. One of the main reasons for the increase in trade visitors is the need for guidance with regards to the new business models and fields of business which digitisation creates.""

Can that really be true? How bizarre that people need to fly to Germany to talk, face to face, with other people about stuff which lends itself perfectly to an online discussion. Nowt so strange as folk, eh.  <br/>Emma
