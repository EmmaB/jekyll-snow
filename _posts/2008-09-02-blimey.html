I was on the phone yesterday evening to Rob, about half six, and went to lie down on my bed whilst I spoke to him. Next thing I knew it was 1am. And then I didn't get up until 8am today! 

If you want anything doing by me, ask today because I have so much energy and am more rested than I think I'm going to be for the next 15 years. Quick, ask me!  <br/>Emma
