Absolutely brilliant news has come through that Borders UK, which was up for sale by its US parent company, has successfully been bought by Luke Johnson and will remain under David Roche's control. Any other solution - and the options ranging from shipbreaking to one that would involve integration with another business (read months of eye-off-the-ball and closures) - would have spelled disaster, for them and us. Borders do an excellent job of supporting independent publishers. I am simply thrilled by this news.  <br/>Emma
