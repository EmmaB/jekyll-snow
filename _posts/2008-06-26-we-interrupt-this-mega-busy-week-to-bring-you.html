... a haul for 25 from Ebay. <img alt="socks1.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/socks1.jpg" width="400" height="267" />

Including P&P! What happens is that new mothers get a million newborn things, which they never use, and flog 'em in bundles on Ebay. Seriously, all my baby clothes shopping is done, for 45 all in. Rather embarrassingly, I have another two parcels on the way with wintery jackets and warm cardigans.
