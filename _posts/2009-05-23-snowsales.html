Ro is now of the age where he's paying very close attention to what I say. This means I can't swear any more. That means that I am swearing, in compensation, more than usual when I use the written word. So high-tail it over to the Snowsales blog to hear me cuss at length. 

(I can't swear on the Snowblog because my mum reads it. Hello, Mum. But she doesn't have the password to Snowsales so all bets are off, there.) 

(I don't actually swear that much on the Snowsales site. I'm all talk no trousers.)  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
