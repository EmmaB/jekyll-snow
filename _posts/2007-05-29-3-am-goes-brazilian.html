<a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/">3:AM Magazine</a>, whose <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1905005202/ref=nosim/snowbooks-21">Edgier Waters</a> anthology Snowbooks published last summer, has just launched <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/brasil/">3:AM Brasil</a>, a Portuguese-language version of the site dedicated to new writing, music and culture from Brazil. In these translation-poor times (the UK has one of the lowest proportions of literature in translation in the developed world), it's great to see such a promising new venue for cultural exchange.

<a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/brasil/">Go check it out</a> - and if you are Brazilian, or know any Brazilians, spread the word.  <br/><h4></h4>
