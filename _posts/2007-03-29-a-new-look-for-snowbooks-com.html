Do you like our new look? The old one was getting a little tired, so we put it out to graze. This version is really a half-way house between Snowbooks.com 1.0 and Snowbooks.com 2.0, which will have lots of new and useful features, and which we plan to unveil later in the year when the machine elves have been <del>beaten</del> <del>paid</del> gently encouraged enough.

[geek bit] If you remember, some time last year, <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2006/09/please_ignore_the_man_behind_t_1.html">I rebuilt the website</a> entirely in valid XHTML and CSS. This meant that this time round, all I had to do was tinker with the CSS and upload a few images to give us a makeover - I didn't have to touch any of the content.
