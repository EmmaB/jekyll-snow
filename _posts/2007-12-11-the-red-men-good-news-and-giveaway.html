What do we have here? Ah! *Another* book on the Spread the Word shortlist! Hooray! 

For various reasons, I'm delighted to say that The Red Men has been selected to be part of the shortlist. It is a superb book, and deserves accolades and prizes. If you'd like to read a copy, to celebrate this late entrant and because I'm feeling relatively festive I have five to go to good homes. 

Also, it is red and gold - perfect Christmas colours.
