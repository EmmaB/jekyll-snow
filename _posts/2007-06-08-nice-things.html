There is an <a href="http://historicalromanceuk.blogspot.com/">excellent blog interview</a> on the Historical Romance blog by our very own Sarah Bryant. 

And now, some news about our friends the trees.

<img alt="woodland.gif" src="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/woodland.gif" width="150" height="94" /> Yes! Snowbooks has sponsored a tree. Well, actually, my lovely mum has sponsored a tree in Snowbooks' name. Thanks, mum! Our tree is at Merry Hill Farm in Hertforshire. If you would like to sponsor a tree, you can go to the Woodland Trust's website: <a href="http://www.wt-dedicateatree.org.uk">www.wt-dedicateatree.org.uk</a>. I will follow my mum's excellent example and sponsor a new tree every month - it's only a tenner which I would otherwise spend on coffee and twixes. I wonder if I ask nicely whether I can get them to plant them so that from space they spell out 'Snowbooks'? 

(By the way, if anyone ever wants to donate any money to Snowbooks' favourite charity, it's <a href="http://www.puretrust.org.uk/">Pure</a>.) <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
