For such a simple name, it seems to have an excess of variations. You're more than welcome to refer to us in any way you like, of course, but here is the definitive guide to spelling and pronouncing Snowbooks. It is Snowbooks. Not SnowBooks, or Snow Books, or snowbooks, or Snow. Or Snow Press, or Snow Publishing. 

And my name is Emma Barnes, not Emma Snow.

And it is pronounced with the emphasis on Snow, not books. Snowbooks. Not SnowBOOKS. 

Good. Glad we got that cleared up. <br/>Emma
