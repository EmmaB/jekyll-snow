Much of last Sunday was spent musing about how I was going to make my new <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.aussiewhipmaker.com/images/whip1.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.aussiewhipmaker.com/Kangaroo-Hide-Bullwhip-12-Plait.htm&h=784&w=1140&sz=123&hl=en&start=6&um=1&tbnid=pLnxAvNHFe6yEM:&tbnh=103&tbnw=150&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dbullwhip%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1T4DMUK_en-GBGB218GB218%26sa%3DN">bullwhip</a>, in honour of the new Indiana Jones film (said films being a primary reason for me doing an archaeology degree. Oh yeah, that and screwing up my history A level so I couldn't do history. Thanks, Dr Arthurson, wherever you are, for teaching us the wrong syllabus). But now I want to make one of <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2008/04/illumination.html">these.  </a> Isn't it gorgeous? 

<em>Rob's comment</em>: I will be lending Em my copy of Make Magazine issue 9 and pointing to p82 where they show you how to make a bullwhip.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
