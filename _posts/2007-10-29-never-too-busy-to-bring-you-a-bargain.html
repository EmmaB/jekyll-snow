I got this, and they say there's no restriction on the number of people who use it so print it out and fly, people, fly to Borders! Also, whilst you're printing it out, I imagine the rest of this webpage will go with you to Borders. So here's a message to take with you: 

Hello, treasured Borders' store manager! You are kindly promoting some of our books this Christmas. They are <em>Cooking with Booze</em>, <em>How to Worry Friends and Inconvenience People</em>, <em>The Red Men</em>, <em>Crafter's Companion</em>, <em>The Fall</em>, <em>Deep Hanging Out</em>, <em>The Killing Art</em> and <em>Monster Planet</em> - all mighty fine books. Please give them extra love, reserve pride of place for them and treat them as your own first-borns - although, of course, be happy to sell them for cash money. Happy Christmas! Love from Snowbooks, your publisher pals. xxx
