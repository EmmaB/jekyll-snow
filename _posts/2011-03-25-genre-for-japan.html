<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2011/mar/23/science-fiction-fantasy-japan-relief">The Guardian</a> today picks up on an initiative that we're proud to be a part of. <a href="http://genreforjapan.wordpress.com/about/">Genre for Japan</a> is a way to raise lots of money to help the crisis effort. It's an auction of amazing genre-related things. 

Our contribution is this: 
"Unique A1 colour poster from UK indie publisher Snowbooks, featuring a selection of jacket designs of their bestselling horror, sci fi and fantasy titles from leading genres authors including Wayne Simmons (Flu, Fever), George Mann (The Affinity Bridge, Ghosts of Manhattan), Thomas Emson (Maneater, Skarlet, Krimson), Paula Brackston (Book of Shadows), Alan Baker (Martian Ambassador), Mark Hodder (Spring Heeled Jack), Paul Magrs (Enter Wildthyme). Poster is signed by the authors and personalised to the winner. It will be delivered to the winner in the packing tube that will be used to send it around the world to the authors for their signature - the authors will also write a little something on the tube."

I have yet to design it, but as soon as it's done I'll show you! Get bidding, chaps.  <br/>Emma
