It's getting chilly at night. I suppose I could just turn the heat up and hang the expense but it's quite nice to be tucked up snugly in bed, under warm covers, in a cool room. The problem of course is that books don't hold themselves up, and my arms get cold if I extend them outside the protective cocoon of duvet. I think what is needed is some sort of fingerless opera glove, perhaps made of fleece, that extends all the way up to the shoulder. Do North Face or maybe Arc'teryx make a thing like that do you suppose?  <br/>Rob
