Here's the <a href="http://fantasybookcritic.blogspot.com/2009/07/osiris-ritual-by-george-mann-reviewed.html">first review</a> of The Osiris Ritual, George Mann's hotly awaited new novel. George's wife and I spent a very pleasant Saturday mostly in the garden with our children whilst our respective husbands signed and packed the slipcase editions which you can now order! 

I would suggest buying it from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Osiris-Ritual-George-Mann/dp/1906727449/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1246961559&sr=8-2">Amazon </a>at the moment as they appear to have lots of money off it, plus it boosts our rankings. (Sorry, everyone who's not Amazon.)  <br/>Emma
