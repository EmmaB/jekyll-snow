Four and a half months ago, SnowAuthor Stacie Lewis had a little girl. But she's just told me that May was born with cerebral palsy. Stacie is writing a diary about bringing May up <a href="http://mamalewis.wordpress.com/">here</a> which is incredibly well written and pretty upbeat. You might want to link to it so others in a similar position can draw strength from her words.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
