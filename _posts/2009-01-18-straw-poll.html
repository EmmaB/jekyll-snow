If I attended a conference with Ro in a sling, would that be shocking and annoying for other conference-goers or within the bounds of acceptability? Before having him, I would have thought it was very weird, but now I think it would be OK. He doesn't make a noise in his sling. Honest thoughts very welcome.  <br/>Emma
