Tell you what: I don't half love my computer. I am just about to send <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005604.html">City Cycling</a> to print - it's finished, at last. But the InDesign file is over a gig large! 1,198,320 KB to be exact. And my lovely, darling, precious computer handles it without a sniff. 'One gig?' it says. 'Pah! I laugh in the face of enormous files! I scoff at your feeble attempts to overload me! I am all-powerful!'

Yes you are, computer. Yes you are.
