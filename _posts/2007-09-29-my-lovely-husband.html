...has just bought two tickets to see the Cure next March as an early birthday present for me (I'm 33 next Wednesday, since you ask). Wheeeeeee! I am taking breaks in between dancing my excited dance to type this post. It's their only UK show next year where they will be, no doubt, playing from their... NEW ALBUM. Best News Ever.

Update, some minutes later:

Hmm. Dancing is all well and good but if it means you fall over and sprain your ankle, as I have just done, it rather detracts from the celebrations. Bah. No Bicester Shopping Village for me, today, which was my other birthday treat. Bah.
