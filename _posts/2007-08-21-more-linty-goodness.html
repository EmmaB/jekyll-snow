And here's another thing I thought you might be interested in:  <a href="http://www.playstationseason.com/PBL_kondo.html">an animation</a> that was done of Steve Aylett's story 'The Man Whose Head Expanded' (which appeared in the Serpent's Tail anthology 'Perverted <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Perverted-Language-Fiction-inspired-Inspired/dp/1852429291/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/202-2700263-5142214?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187694808&sr=8-1">By Language' </a>- stories based on Fall songs).
