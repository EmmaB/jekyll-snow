I dyed my hair. No, it is not Chestnut, as the box promised. It is Darkest Brown. Darkest, Darkest Brown With Weird Red Bits. And did it achieve Perfect Coverage Of Grey? No, it did not - I still have my weird Cruella de Ville white streak. 

All that hope of a Chestnutty future, and all the gasping for breath trying not to inhale toxic fumes, and for what? Sigh.  <br/>Emma
