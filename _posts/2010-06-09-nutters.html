Hey, chaps! Look at this press release! Congrats to Paula, the genius author. 

Brecon Beacons author <a href="http://www.mind.org.uk/news/3493_mind_awards_2010_nominees_announced">shortlisted</a> for Mind Book of the Year Award

Brecon Beacons author and P.J.Davy has been shortlisted for Minds Book of the Year Award 2010 for her latest book Nutters. The national charity award, now in its 29th year, celebrates writing that contributes to a greater understanding of mental health issues in all their forms.

Bent on reinvention and tired of being labelled a loon, Nutters central character Rufus Waters decides to reject his mental health problems and instead choose sanity. P.J Davys unique comic novel takes take the reader through the fruitless, often hilarious efforts of Rufus to deny his true self. Throughout the book Davy tackles a serious subject in an entertaining manner, which achieves a book that is truly thought-provoking.  
 
Nutters is Davys first comic novel, and she is currently working on her second as well as a screenplay. She lives halfway up a Brecon Beacon with her partner and their two children.
                                                                                                           
P.J. Davys Nutters is among seven books that have been shortlisted by the Mind judges Blake Morrison, Fay Weldon and Michle Roberts, for the coveted prize. The winner will be announced on Thursday 8 July at the Mind Awards ceremony in central London.
