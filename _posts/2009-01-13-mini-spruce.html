It is true. Sometimes I choose titles for my blog posts because I know which picture Rob will come up with (for newcomers, Rob's main job at Snowbooks - as well as being chairman - is to put pictures on the blog posts.) Today I've given a dust to the Snowbooks homepage. It is now, as befits our recessionary era, full of free stuff. Go! Enjoy! (You might have to refresh the page.)  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
