So it's LBF tomorrow. My Just-In-Time catalogue creating and printing came good - my catalogues arrived at 6pm yesterday. Phew, shouldn't leave it so late. My pass is printed, my bag is packed, my extra comfy shoes are on standby. Forgive me, then, if I'm a bit unresponsive on the ol' email this week. See you there if you're going - we're on the IPG stand as ever.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
