<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/apr/23/worklifebalance.discriminationatwork">Here's an interesting article </a>(to me, at least, the newly aware) about how pregnant women and mothers are still subject to discrimination. I hope Snowbooks isn't going to be horrible to me. You can imagine the conversation: 

Me (as pregnant lady): So, can I have some time off to have a baby? I promise I'll be back at work in six weeks or so, and I'll check my email and everything. And can I have my proper job back afterwards? 
Me (as Snowbooks boss): No. 
Me (PL): Oh. But what about my rights? 
Me (SB): Well you can take me to tribunal but you'll look a bit stupid, talking to yourself. 
Me (PL): Sigh. 

Makes me appreciate being my own boss even more. God, who'd ever work for someone if they could help it?  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
