Snowbooks.com will not so much be 'down' as 'patchily populated' for about 45 mins this evening. I'm pushing a fairly hefty change which will require an upload of data as well as code, which can take a bit of time. So forgive any rather spare-looking pages you come across between about 8 and 9pm tonight. I thank you. 

(I should say that once the push is completed, you won't see much difference - it's a big change to the code of the website, rather than the look and feel or content. If you see something remarkably different after about 9pm, then something's gone horribly wrong...)  <br/>Emma
