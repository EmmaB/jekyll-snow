I have two superpowers. Both of them are stupid.
1) I can catch anything on anything else. I could run through the house with a shoe lace in my hand and get it tangled on a door handle or accidentally pull over a lamp with it.
2) If I look in a shop window a crowd will form behind me and then jostle me out of the way. It doesn't matter if the window only contains car parts or junction boxes and the people behind me are little old ladies who aren't mechanics or electricians. The little old ladies will still become fascinated to know what I am looking at and have to see.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
