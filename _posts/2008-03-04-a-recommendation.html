It's only once you've lived with a crappy laser printer for a year or so that you can truly appreciate the wonder that is a good printer. And so I would like to share with you the name of our current printer. It is an HP Laserjet 4250. It is fast, economical, totally robust and reliable, did I mention fast, does duplex, and is all round a joy to print on. Having almost got to the weeping stage at several times with previous printers - and I'm sure you know what I mean - I think it's worth the 475 plus 100 toner. Yes, it's a lot, but *it's worth it.*  <br/>Emma
