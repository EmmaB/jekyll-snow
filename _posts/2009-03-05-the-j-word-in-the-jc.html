I know I put reviews up here relatively often, and leave you to it. But do read <a href="http://www.thejc.com/articles/grandad-fights-back">this review</a> of The J-Word in the Jewish Chronicle, and do buy the book, or get it from the library. It's really a superb story and I promise you'll find it enjoyable and interesting. The official Barnes guarantee; there you go.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
