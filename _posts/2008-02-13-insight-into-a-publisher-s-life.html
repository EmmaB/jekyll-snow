I am currently covered in gravad lax. Ah, if only there were photos. I thought I'd have a nice bit of smoked salmon for my lunch, and it comes with a pouch of gravad lax, er, sauce. Said pouch opened a bit more readily than its seals suggested, so when I gave it a mighty rend it went All. Over. Me. 

Must be like what having a moustache is like - I'll be finding bits of mustardy dill sauce in my hair all day. 

In summary: publishers literally bathe in high end foodstuffs all day long. Fact.  <br/>Emma
