So do you want to have your covers designed by Snowbooks?

Bet you do. I would. Not only are they nice to look at, they sell books. But did you know that they are also about as cheap as you can get? You can download our new <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/ratecard.pdf">ratecard here</a>. It shows you that cover design is only &pound;550 - and that includes all original and stock artwork. 

Seriously, it's a bargain. *And* we are quick and nice to deal with. Ask anyone. I'm sure Scott Pack would give us a reference, wouldn't you, Scott? We can turn a brief around in a couple of days, if pushed.
