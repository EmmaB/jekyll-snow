I can't think why I haven't mentioned this before, but my ace pal <a href="http://www.jennashworth.blogspot.com/">Jenn</a> has been busy reinventing bits of the world again and has set up a website with a fellow librarian so that they can throw open their collaborative novel to the world. It's <a href="http://elevenpenceperbookperday.blogspot.com/">here</a> and it's called 'Sh'. Check the sidebar to see how to contribute and who's been doing the spade-work up 'til now. And remember to lead inventive lives, like Jenn and her friends.

That picture, by the way, is only there because it happens to show a very interesting <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/05/battling_misanthropy.html">Life After People</a> kind of library. It's by someone called Lori Nix. Click on it once to see a larger version. Click on that to go to the artist's website (albeit in an annoyingly small window). So here's the <a href="http://www.lorinix.net/inside.php3?kateg=21#">direct link</a> too.  <br/>Rob
