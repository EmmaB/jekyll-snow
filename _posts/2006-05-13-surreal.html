Have you seen Grosse Point Blank? Brilliant eighties reunion film. The bit where John Cusack is sitting in the car of his old friend who's now an estate agent; they're having a normal chat and suddenly the guy honks his horn and yells "Ten years, man! Ten years!" After the hangovers had worn off, it was pretty much back to normal in the Snowbooks office, except every now and again I want to shout "Small Publisher of the Year, man! Small Publisher!" 

We have had some lovely coverage this week. Nic Clee in the Times today calls us <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,923-2176085.html">'enterprising'</a>. In the same paper there's a mention of Sue and Jane <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,923-2176410.html">talking about </a>Plotting for Beginners. We should rename it the SnowTimes. Precious Clare on the <a href="http://www.thefridayproject.co.uk/vox/">Friday Project blog</a> is the first writer to use the line 'there's no business like Snow business' (finally) (And Clare also had a letter in the Times! I never read the Times normally. I wonder if there are three or more pieces to do with people I know every week?) <a href="http://www.britishbookawards.co.uk/bba/pnbb_tradeawards_frontpage.asp">Publishing News</a> printed my <a href="http://www.publishingnews.co.uk/pn/pno_news4.asp?">acceptance speech joke </a>(which was so lame I'm not going to repeat it) and said that I define the term 'hands on'.<a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/books/features/article364016.ece "> The Literator</a> in the Independent said we were one of several "crucial players in independent publishing [who] picked up key awards." And James (who can really write, turns out) wrote a piece which will appear on Monday's <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/culturevulture/">Culture Vulture blog. </a>

I wonder what will happen next week?  <br/>Emma
