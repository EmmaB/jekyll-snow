Estate agents, literary agents, newsagents. Wait, no, not newsagents. In fact look for a future post about how Snowbooks' secret weapon is one particular newsagent. But those others...  We don't have a problem with <em>all</em> middlemen, but if you sit between the producer of something and the consumer of something and you don't retail it or distribute or warehouse it - well you'd better make sure you do <em>something </em>for your share of the proceeds. And you also better make sure that your share is in proportion to what you add not what you can get away with. I mention this for two reasons. One is - and historically people react badly to this statement - publishers are just middlemen too. We don't <em>do </em>anything, we just sort of coordinate activity, stump up a bit of cash and contribute some marketing. So we have no guaranteed place in the future of the book world. I know! A world with books but no publishers; it seems impossible. But it's a good reason not to get smug. Without us, there'd still be authors, printers, distributors, retailers, cover designers, proofreaders - oh, and readers - there'd just be no one to tell them all to do it. And saying 'Go!' is clearly not a proper job description. No, we need to 'continually reinvent ourselves' and 'look for ways to add value' and all those other bleurgh-making terms for good ideas. Plus I'd have to say most of the publishers we know aren't about to get complacent. We're not successful enough for that. But for a cautionary tale on what happens when the middlemen get too full of themselves read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0,,2025767,00.html">Guardian Unlimited: The Fat-Cat Jukebox</a>. The music industry is ripe for a shake-up and they've done it to themselves. If they're not careful, they'll get 'disintermediated' and all that will be left is musicmakers and music-lovers and a big not-for-profit website that sits between the two, matching up tastes with tunes, and the world will be the better for it.


*Disintermediated is a jargon word I <em>do</em> like. In case you weren't huffing venture capital and turning your business into an e-business in the late Nineties, you might not know the term. It means 'to cut out the middleman'. <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
