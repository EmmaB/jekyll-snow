Here's a new website, full of the joys of ONIX. Get in touch if you are a publisher who is ONIX compliant but who is only using their data to upload to Nielsen. I will show you how Your Life Will Never Be The Same Again In A Good Way - or how you can have Wednesday afternoons off because you have to do so much less work, because ONIX can be used to update any and all marketing and website materials you care to shake a stick at.

(Also, guess what, guess what? Rob and I just saw Patrick Stewart* in Chipping Norton in a left hand drive racing green Jag with the top down, looking fabulously Captain-like. Do you think he might just whisper under his breath 'engage' when he starts up the engine? Oh, I hope so...)

*Jean Luc Picard**, if you don't know. 
**Lordy, if you don't know that, you don't deserve to know***. 
***Oh, OK. STTNG****!
****Star Trek: The Next Generation.
