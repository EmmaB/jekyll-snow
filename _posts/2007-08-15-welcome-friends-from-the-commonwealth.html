There's a rather nice mention of the Snowcase Bookseller story on<a href="http://beattiesbookblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/snowbooks-provides-showcase-for-authors.html"> this eminent blog</a> written by Mr Graham Beattie "Former Managing Director/Publisher of Penguin Books NZ Ltd., and Scholastic NZ Ltd. Former Books & Poetry Editor, Citymix Magazine. Now works as a consultant within the publishing industry and as a book reviewer, book blogger and judge of book awards". Blimey. See what fine company you're in, esteemed Snowblog readers? 

Anyway, it's sparked a flurry of query letters, which I thought I'd answer here. *Yes*, Snowbooks is delighted to accept submissions from anywhere in the world. *Yes*, we are ably and happily represented and distributed by Hardie Grant in Australia and New Zealand. *No*, the free books club does not extend to Australia, sadly. We are not made of stamps.  <br/>Emma
