OK folks, this is your seven-day warning. Next week I am on Admin Holiday! It's a new, *exciting* sort of a holiday whereby I will still be in the office, but I won't be doing anything other than typesetting and cover design. I need to get a whole bunch of books off to the printer in time for Christmas and at this rate it's just not going to happen. Hence my brilliant new Admin Holiday invention.

So if you email, or phone, I probably won't reply to you until Monday 23rd. If it's really, really urgent please mark the email 'Really Really Urgent'. 

Or, alternatively, bombard me this week with your queries.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
