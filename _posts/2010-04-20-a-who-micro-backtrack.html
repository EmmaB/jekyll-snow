Referring to the most recent Doctor Who episode, I would like to revise my <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/04/who_review_3.html">previous statement</a> that "everything and everyone else was horrible". There's an exception I need to add: the Dalek propaganda poster from the episode. The BBC are offering a nice big PDF of it <a href="http://id.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00s56d2">here</a>.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
