We are extremely pleased to announce that Snowbooks was last night named Small Publisher of the Year at the British Book Awards, in a joint award with fellow publishers Profile. Emma, Gilly, Anna and James all attended the ceremony and rushed the stage en masse to collect the award. Only Gilly fell over.

In just three years, Snowbooks has gone from a two-person start-up to a four-person team, with a growing list and over 90,000 books sold. We are passionate about all our titles and believe that our innovative approach to the publishing process shows through in our work. We are very glad and very proud that this has been recognised by our peers.

Of course, none of this would have happened without the generous support of our authors, the book retailers, the trade press, and our fellow publishers. We offer heartfelt congratulations to our fellow Small Publisher winner, Profile books, and to all the other winners and nominees.
