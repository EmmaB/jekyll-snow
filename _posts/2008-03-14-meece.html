If you don't like rodents, then don't click on the cheese thumbnail to the left because that's what you'll get a picture of. But if you do, then do, because I think they look nice. When I went into my kitchen this morning I heard rustling. That picture is what I found behind my fridge. I think I'm going to have to get humane traps to catch these little fellows and transport them out of my house (though in these old barns, apparently they come galloping back). But I'd rather have cute little buttons like these stealing my food and eating my wires than spiders doing whatever unspeakable things they do.  <br/>Rob
