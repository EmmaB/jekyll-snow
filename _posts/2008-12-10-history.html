As part of sorting out my late dad's affairs, I'm having to go through lots of paperwork. It's nearly all from the last few years, as he was good at clearing out anything that was no longer needed. So the odd document from long ago really stands out. One such is, I suspect, his first pay slip. I also came across this invoice from 1968 (click <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/CortinaInvoice.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/CortinaInvoice.html','popup','width=490,height=194,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0');return false">here</a> to see a picture of part of it). It's for a brand new Ford Cortina in Alpina Green at a basic cost of 656 and ten shillings (including safety belts). Given in part exchange was a Vauxhall Victor. I assume this is the first car he bought from new. I particularly like the invoice produced on a typewriter with 'I's instead of '1's for some reason. Pure history.  <br/>Rob
