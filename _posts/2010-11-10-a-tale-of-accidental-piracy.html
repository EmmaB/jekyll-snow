Well done, Em, for lightening the tone. And now, back to the bad news.

This will be my third and hopefully (fingers crossed) final post about Emma's and my disastrous involvement with Robin Tobin. At least for a while. With any luck. See <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/10/announcement.html#more">here</a> and <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/10/trust_issues.html#more">here</a> for parts I and II. This post is the potted history of the business that the three of us started - Onix Central - the business that on Monday of this week we effectively shut down because our principal product, unbeknownst to us, turns out to be built on pirated code, courtesy of Guess Who? (Clue: he features prominently in the two  posts mentioned above.) I hope no one will be offended by my flippant tone here: in difficult times I tend to favour slightly inappropriate black humour over despair. I'll tell you what we thought was going on and then I'll tell you what was really happening.

So this version of the tale is full of lies, but lies that Emma and I actually believed up until recently. What we <em>thought</em> we  were doing was taking Robin's experience at his former company, Anko Publishing Software, and creating a next-generation competitor to their Anko Publishing Manager (APM). For those who don't know, the APM helped you manage your ONIX data and assisted with a lot of the core publishing processes as well. Robin had  founded Anko and written their APM software before he was cruelly forced out of the firm. But Robin had learned a lot since writing the original APM and decided to start afresh, building a new system from the ground up which incorporated all the improvements his experience had taught him publishers were crying out for. He also had good relationships with many of Anko's customers and felt that many of them would be eager (he said) to switch their business to us. Robin would focus on development while Emma ran the business day to day and handled most of the other jobs, like writing the manual, creating and updating the website and so on. I was supposed to be a technical architect of sorts, planning how we'd move the initial version of the software, which uses FileMaker, onto the web. As it turned out, for a number of reasons, I did very little, but Emma has been working flat out for eighteen months, running Snowbooks, then finding another eight hours or so a day to put into Onix Central, while simultaneously looking after her young son.

As I mentioned in previous instalments, we believed that Anko not only made it impossible for Robin to stay, they also hounded him once he left, getting a court to freeze his assets and spreading false accusations about him. He was the goose that laid the golden eggs and they were intent on profiting from his efforts regardless of his wishes. Once we knew that the other 999 things we thought we knew about Robin were deceptions, we checked out his version of the Anko story and found, as expected, that most of it was hogwash, with one or two genuine facts sprinkled in, but given an expert twist in order to convince the casual observer without giving the game away.

It's not my place to tell the Anko story, and the tale itself is complicated by the fact that Robin's father, Paschal Tobin, is one of the principals of the business. Suffice it to say that having spent a couple of days chatting with Paschal, Emma and I are full of admiration for him and his attempts to make the honourable best of a completely impossible situation. And of course Paschal's version of events not only fits the facts far better, it makes vastly more sense than Robin's concoction of half-truths and paranoid-sounding accusations. We also discovered in our conversations that while Robin was indeed a founder of the firm, he contributed very little of their code. I've intimated before that Robin is something of a genius when it comes to his deceptions, but his gifts don't appear to extend to detail-oriented, single-focus tasks like programming. He hasn't the temperament, the necessary concentration span or the fundamental motivation to sit still for eight hours at a time perfecting FileMaker scripts and finessing tables. Which rang alarm bells with us. After all, isn't that just what Robin had supposedly been doing for the last year or more? I mean, I'd always wondered how he could write functioning code when he couldn't put a three-line e-mail together without two typos and a missing word...

On the other hand, we'd just learned that he would court multiple women at the same time, while harrassing others, contacting new ones on dating sites, chatting to his current victims on instant message software - making sure that each thought they were the sole and future Mrs. Robin Tobin -  while keeping his exes in check - and we'd wondered where he could possibly have found the time. So, anyone in the audience want to venture a guess at the answer to that question?

In the words of Aristotle: 'Doh!'. The eight hours a day that Robin wasn't really writing code for us were the very same eight hours a day he was actually managing his empire of deceit and fake relationships.

Which led on to the follow-up question, if Robin wasn't really writing our code, then where was it coming from? Every step of the way Robin had needed pleading, cajoling and humouring to get him to produce anything, but eventually, after enormous amounts of drama and numerous diva-like meltdowns, we had actually received from him a product that was 95% finished. In a fit of exasperation, Emma somehow found even more hours in the day and took over the final stage of development required to fill in that final 5% and to test the resultant product. We'd got a handsome piece of functional software from somewhere, but where? 

If Robin didn't write the bulk of Anko's APM and he didn't write the bulk of our competitor to it, where had the main body of our code come from? Once again, Paschal Tobin was able to provide the answer. Onix Central's Publishing Manager (OCPM) wasn't so much a ground-up rewrite of the idea behind Anko's APM, as it was a makeover with a few new bells and whistles. New functions had been added, the visual interface had been substantially altered, but hidden in the detail, scripts and table relationships had simply been lifted, wholesale, from Anko's APM. We've seen the screenshots of code from the two products laid side-by-side: and it seems, though Emma and I never intended it, that we're pirates now - but not the crowd-pleasing, Johnny Depp kind, unfortunately.

So just to recap our relationship with Anko: while believing, thanks to Robin, that they were cads of the first order, we had used a laptop which they owned to take the software that they had written to make a competitor to their main product which, as well as being offered to new customers, we would use to lure away some of their old clients. I'm not sure that 'Oops' really covers it. From a purely selfish point of view, it's a darned good thing that Robin's father is our contact at Anko because he instantly understood how we could have unwittingly done such a thing.

And while we're talking about cold comfort, this recent revelation has at least removed the need to solve a particularly tricky moral dilemma we'd been wrestling with. For a while, once we knew that Robin was, in essence, a confidence trickster with a very sordid and prolific romantic history, we still had no idea that our software was pirated. Even though Onix Central had been founded by the three of us, Robin didn't want to be a named director of the firm and he'd signed his share in the ownership of the company over to Emma. His stated reasons for this, to do with the non-existent Anko court case, are a smoke-screen. I assume he has enough angry people after him that he doesn't want his name to appear in places like Companies House. But whatever his motives, it meant that it was straightforward for Emma and me, as the only two directors and the only two shareholders, to eject Robin from the business. Morally, however, we worried about confiscating all his hard work. On the one hand, he'd apparently put in months of effort which Onix Central would now benefit from, but on the other hand, we knew what he'd do with any income: he'd continue to seduce, manipulate and traumatise women. Having spent many hours on the phone to one of his victims who'd told me that Robin's apparently legitimate business connections had allayed her worries that he was a con man I couldn't see myself posting a cheque to Robin each month and one day having to look one of his victims in the eyes and tell her that I'd done that. Equally it didn't sit well at all to put ourselves in a position to profit financially from what we thought must surely be the only piece of proper, honest work that Robin had ever done.

Well, as you can see, we needn't have worried. We're not cutting Robin out of a fortune; we're ejecting him from a business with no source of income. We've withdrawn our OCPM from sale, notified our customers, and we're making arrangements with Anko to offer our customers a possible migration path. We've also signed over whatever IP we might retain in the OCPM to Anko in case it's of any use to them. Anko, very kindly, have extended a sort of retrospective licence to customers of our product, covering them for the fact that part of the software they bought is really Anko property. In addition, Emma intends to work with Anko to offer a support contract to any of Onix Central's customers who may want to go down that route.

Snowbooks, fortunately, remains unaffected, except for a few blows to the dignity and reputation of its directors.

And Robin remains at large, whereabouts unknown, presumably taken in by some kind-hearted woman somewhere who truly believes she is rescuing a lost soul and not sheltering a monster. We have been in communication with the Thames Valley Police, but it's proving very difficult to come up with concrete charges upon which they could act, though I suspect that each report they receive about him from someone new makes it more difficult for him to continue to operate with impunity. Robin has suggested in recent e-mails to us that he will continue to offer the Onix Central Publishing Manager for sale and that he refutes any allegation that it's either pirated or, even if it were, that he isn't the original author of the stolen code and entitled to do with it as he pleases. Unfortunately for him, even if that were somehow true, which the evidence fails to support, you can't tell nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine lies and hope for your thousandth remark to be treated as gospel. 

So if a scruffy but charming man meeting Robin's description does approach you and offers to sell you some bibliographic software, we urge you to decline. And if someone out there does know who Robin is  in a relationship with right now, could you kindly point them in the direction of these blog posts and the e-mail address <a href="mailto:After.RT@gmail.com">After.RT@gmail.com</a> which is a point of contact we've established for talking with his victims. <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
