Very pleased to see a wonderful review of <em>The Romanian</em> in this week's Time Out London, <a href="http://www.timeout.com/london/gay/review/book/79/bruce_benderson_the_romanian.html">available online here</a>. Thank you, Mr Burston, and may we confim that Bruce is, indeed, one hell of a charmer.  <br/><h4></h4>
