I can heartily recommend <a href="http://www.pelawpack.co.uk/">Pelaw Presentation Packaging</a> should you be in the market for slipcases. It's one of the few things that Haynes can't do, so I had to find another supplier. I found one, who turned out to be crap (not returning calls or emails, overpriced) and at the last minute googled to find Pelaw. I gave them a ring, said I needed a slipcase doing within the week, and would they oblige? They have been nothing but attentive, responsive and organised since. True, there was a slight hiccup with the die, but they kept me informed and we worked to resolve the issue. The final delivery has been made and the slipcases are spot on - even the delivery driver was charming. 

More companies like Haynes and Pelaw, please, Universe.  <br/>Emma
