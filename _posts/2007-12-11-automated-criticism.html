I know I was rubbish at art in school. And I can't draw or paint. But whenever I save a picture I've been working on in Photoshop on my MacBook the default destination is the trash. If I don't notice and then look for my file on the desktop, I'm out of luck. It's been pre-binned for me. What ever happened to encouraging and nurturing talent? Is there a setting they only teach you about in art school that turns off the 'amateur filter'?  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
