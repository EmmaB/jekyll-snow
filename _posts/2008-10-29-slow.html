I imagine you've all seen it, but I rather like the idea of misleadingly populist covers for classics. (See the Guardian pictures <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/gallery/2008/oct/29/canada?picture=339081416">here</a>.) Well not 'like' exactly, but I'm amused by the idea. Provided it's for fun. I forswore buying a Jane Austen book a while back (you may <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/04/the_art_of_persuasion.html#more">remember</a>) because they'd made it look like a YA fantasy novel. I'm also reminded of the downmarket alternative covers some DVDs get sold with that make them look like they've got lots more sex, comedy and ruffty-tuffty action than they really do have. I actually held off buying a copy of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181875/">Almost Famous</a> because my local DVD shop only had the cover that made it look like a porn movie (which it's not). If you're interested to see what I mean, contrast the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Almost-Famous-REGION-1-NTSC/dp/B00003CXMG/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1225308406&sr=1-6">US edition</a> with the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Almost-Famous-Billy-Crudup/dp/B00005KFU0/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1225308406&sr=1-4">British one</a>.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
