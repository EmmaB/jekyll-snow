Where's that trumpet of mine? Ah, here it is. I just got a lovely email from a Canadian publisher who I've helped out with his XSL (taking ONIX bibliographic data and doing neat things with it, like creating <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/Snowbooks%20FF08%20catalogue.pdf">catalogues</a> (link is a 3mb pdf) and <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9781905005888.html">web pages</a>.) He found out about our XSL services through my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMdc2psf01Y">YouTube videos</a> and he writes: 

"What can I say?
Speedy, efficient, too fair, literary, entrepreneurial, smooth lilting voice and obviously fertile.
Are you taken? ;) Thanks just doesnt cut it."

How's that for an endorsement! [Blush] <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
