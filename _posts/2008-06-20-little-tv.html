There's seems to be less and less TV around me at the moment. I remember working with someone who didn't watch any TV years ago and thinking how weird they were. Although in their case they really <em>were</em> weird. But Em doesn't seem to bother with more than an hour or so of TV a week. Anna has just gone a fortnight without turning on the set. My pal Jenn seems not to own one (though somehow she's able to watch zombie movies). (And my friend Leila used not to have a TV although a job writing about what's on telly might have changed that.) At the moment, I'm watching about four one-hour shows a week, with the adverts all snipped out, courtesy of Sky+. So that's just under three hours. In my case it's not because a) I have so many exciting things to do instead or b) I disapprove of televisions (or anything with buttons, &agrave; la Amish-types). I'm just aware that I've seen it all before, usually done better. What I need is a hobby. Suggestions? (Apart from knitting)  <br/>Rob
