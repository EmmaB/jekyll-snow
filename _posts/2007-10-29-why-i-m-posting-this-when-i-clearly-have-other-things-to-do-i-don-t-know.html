but I'm quite excited to report that I appear to be doing well retraining my posture. I am an awful slumper, and I've been trying really hard over the last few weeks to pull my chin in and keep my back straight. Normally I think about it, find that I'm slumping and pull my chin in. Just now, I thought about it and discovered my chin was already in! I was sitting nicely!

Hooray. I have narrowly avoided being a hunchback in my eighties. Phew.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
