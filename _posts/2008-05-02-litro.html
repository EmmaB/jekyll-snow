I've just been told by Mike Fell of <a href="http://litro.co.uk/index.php">Litro</a> that a short story by one Robert Finn will be appearing in next week's edition. Litro, for anyone not familiar with it, is a sort of literary alternative to the Metro (one of the free London papers). It's available to commuters, and others, who might fancy reading a bit of fiction on their journey. It pops up at the places listed <a href="http://litro.co.uk/distribution.php">here</a>, so look out for it. The Robert Finn story is in a very different vein to his usual work (we did sneak a link to it into a former blog post - but perhaps we'll do so a bit more overtly after the Litro edition has been distributed). If you look around, you'll see that the Litro site also has an <a href="http://litro.co.uk/fiction.php">archive</a> which holds all their former editions. Lots there to dig into for anyone interested.  <br/>Rob
