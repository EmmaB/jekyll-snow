I have just looked again at my letter saying I passed my Open Uni course. Not only did I pass - I got 93%. Please don't tell me I'm a naturally talented bookkeeper. Can't I be a natural gymnast, or horse rider, or theoretical physicist or something? Something a bit less - well, obsessive-compulsive. 

Added bonus fact: The word 'bookkeeper' has consecutive 'o's, 'k's and 'e's. In case you didn't know.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
