This week is rather fun. Five of our authors are on tour, together. They have all written very different books so it's very interesting to see their different answers to different questions. 

Today the SnowTour bus stops at Me and My Big Mouth. <a href="http://meandmybigmouth.typepad.com/scottpack/">Hot foot over to there now.</a>  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
