Congrats to Matthew De Abaitua. Last night was the launch party for <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005581.html">The Red Men</a> and it all went very well. In attendance were lots of writers and journalists, all of them passionate readers. Plus I met a couple of slightly crazy girls (who were nevertheless fascinating company) and learned a considerable amount about the art of film direction and the pitfalls of the modern novel as a result. Then Matthew read a little of the book to the grateful throng. And we weren't just paying attention because Matthew had chosen a smutty bit either - smutty but full of literary merit I'd like to stress.

Now looking back on it, I can't imagine why I didn't have a camera with me so that you'all could see what went on. But then again I don't really leave the house that much, never mind haunt urban dens of literary iniquity and hard liquor, and I think I must have been too startled by the bright lights to remember my duty to the SnowBlog readership. Next time though I'll make sure I get some incriminating negatives for our files.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
