I know, I know. It's June: pretty much half way through the year. But if you can possibly ignore that fact for the moment, and let me tell you that our 2010 catalogue is now up on the <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/snowshop.html">catalogue page</a>, then I'd be grateful. (I did actually print this in time for the London Book Fair - shout if you want a printed copy). Also all our new titles are up for you to see - such as the fantastic <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9781906727925.html">Funeral Pallor</a>, the emotive <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9781906727475.html">Hunter Huntress</a> and a swathe of <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_fitness.html">martial arts books</a> that we've taken over from Summersdale. (Which I have to fix the stupid format in as I've just seen there are weird characters all over the place. Don't write in... )

Sorry about the delay. Things have been... busy. But for one reason and another, welcome to a new era of top efficiency and whatnot - aided not least by the glorious <a href="http://www.onixcentral.com">Publishing Manager</a> which you should obviously have if you're in the trade...  <br/>Emma
