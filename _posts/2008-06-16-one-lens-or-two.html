I was just about to step away from the blog when I noticed this wing&eacute;d thing excavating a troublingly deep hole in the Cotswold stone wall near my window (it belongs to my kindly neighbours). Of course before I could photograph it I had to swap lenses. I have a macro lens and a telephoto, i.e. one for close, one for distance. And every single time I want to take a photo I have to swap them over. In this case I had barely done so when the bird flew away so I didn't have time to get a sharper shot. There's now a single lens for my Nikon D40 that combines the macro with the telephoto. If I ever have enough money sitting around doing nothing to buy one I'll seriously consider it. It would double the usefulness of my camera. In the meantime, click on the photo to get a bigger version of the B&W Stripety Woodpecker, or whatever it's called.  <br/>Rob
