Did you know that the same Onix file that you send to Amazon or Nielsen can also be used to populate your website, feed your catalogues or provide the information for just about anything else that uses your title information? To be honest, if you're a regular SnowBlog reader you should do (or you've just been skipping those posts, in which case you're bad). If you are an ONIX compliant publisher, you will remember spending a vast amount of effort, time and money to get your title information organised. Snowbooks did this, and whilst it was nice to be able to provide Nielsen et al with a tidy ONIX file rather than fill out their PubWeb form, it seemed a lot of work for not much reward. 

Now you can put Onix to work! Life is too short to spend your time cutting and pasting into a catalogue template or rekeying information for your website  information which then requires endless proofing. Rob, me and Robin Tobin the founder of Anko have set up <a href="http://www.onixcentral.com">Onix Central.</a> Visit our new website to learn more about how you may affordably use the results of all the hard work you've already done to reduce your catalogue and AI preparation time down to hours and minutes rather than weeks. On the website youll find free code should you wish to have a tinker yourself, examples of our work, tutorial videos, our transparent pricing and commentary on all things Onix. 
 
And here's a nice thing that one of our customers had to say about us: 

When we moved to an ONIX-based title management approach, we knew we wanted to use XML to produce our catalogs and marketing materials. Onix Central helped us to implement the process in house to get us up and running with this new workflow in a very short time frame - a real time and cost save for us.
