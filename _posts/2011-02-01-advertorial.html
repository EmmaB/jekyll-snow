Rob reminded me today that my last post was ages ago, and something like 'I'm back' - cue big drumroll, much excitement, tooting horns - followed by what we will politely call a swift tapering-off of posting. And so I mark my second, much-anticipated, no doubt heralded return to this blogging forum... with an advert. But it's a good one. See, you're all tantalised now. Click on to see what I could possibly be endorsing.  [<em>update</em>: <a href="http://altfiction.co.uk/the-programme">link</a> fixed now] <a href="http://altfiction.co.uk/the-programme">Alt.Fiction</a> is proud to present its first residential writing weekend  an ideal opportunity for writers of science fiction, fantasy and horror to get away from it all, meet and work with like-minded people and enjoy workshops and talks with established authors in the field.
