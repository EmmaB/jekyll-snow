<div class="pic"><a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/#create/fromacolor"><img alt="ColourWheel.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/ColourWheel.jpg" width="150" height="177" /></a></div>

By the way, that thumbnail image I used in that <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/04/correct_me.html">post</a> about colour-correction came from Adobe's <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/#create/fromacolor">Kuler</a>. If you're into selecting colours for graphic design or web stuff (or maybe choosing your tights to match your skirt) why not take a look. It's a clever website that'll let you assemble palettes based on complementarity and other forms of chromo-cleverness. <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/#create/fromacolor">Link</a>.  <br/>Rob
