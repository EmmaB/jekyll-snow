It's like the internet knows I'm a bit worried about Christmas compliance and deliberately comes up with things to make my weekend all lovely. <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/booksoftheyear2006/story/0,,1956494,00.html">This from today's Guardian</a>: The Romanian features in Simon Callow's pick of 2006.

<b>Simon Callow</b>
<font color="gray">"Bruce Benderson's harrowingly autobiographical The Romanian (Snowbooks) is one of the most devastating and unsparing accounts of amour fou I have ever read, providing at the same time an extraordinary glimpse into Romania's past and present. I read it at the same time as Andrew Holleran's Grief (Hyperion), a novel which - haunted by reflections on Henry Adams as a widower and Mary Lincoln's aimless life after her husband's assassination - deals calmly and wisely, in exquisite pellucid prose, with some fundamental truths. Both these books deal with gay life, but from diametrically opposite points of view. Finally, Ian Buruma's fine and subtle Murder in Amsterdam: The Death of Theo van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance (Atlantic), while specifically and illuminatingly about some Dutch responses to Muslim extremism, has chilling resonances for all of us."</font>
