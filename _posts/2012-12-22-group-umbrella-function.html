There's a new Group feature in Bibliocloud. It means that if you manage a number of publisher clients, or if your business is clearly split into publishing sections, you can have a parent account which your various publisher accounts report in to. <br/>
You'll have to ask us to create a new Group. Once that's done: 
<br/>
- First go to bibliocloud.com and make sure you're signed out. Then go to bibliocloud.com/register and register as a new client. Call the account anything other than your existing company account name (it won't let you enter a duplicate name, anyway). <a href="#one">[ 1]</a>
<br/>
Click through from the confirmation email you'll receive, to sign in. 
<br/>
In your new client account go to Edit Client which is the last option on the last tab on the navigation bar, where all the other preferences and settings are. Click on "Join Another Group", bottom left. Select your group from the drop down list. 
<br/>
Now, sign out of Bibliocloud and sign in to the main company account. On the first nav bar tab you'll see a link, Access Group Settings for [your company account name]. You should be able to access both the main account and the new account you've just set up. You'll see some nascent info about the group clients - just a work count for the time being. Obviously this page will evolve into a more complete dashboard. <br/>
