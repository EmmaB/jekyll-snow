Happy new year! 

Over the festive period we've made a bunch of improvements to Bibliocloud, ranging from some design changes to a new website for guests visiting Bibliocloud for the first time. One notable feature is that you can now change the background of Bibliocloud. When you're logged in, click on the tan, grey or blue clouds, top right under the nav bar, to see what I mean. We've also added a search function to pretty much every index page. 

Forthcoming changes in the next two weeks will be the finishing touches to the developing print proposal, forecast and estimation section. We'll keep you posted! <br/><h4></h4>
