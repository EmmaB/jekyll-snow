Google's just launched a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/interstitial?url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">new thing</a> which alerts you to websites which might harm your computer - with scripts and so on. Thing is, 100% of the sites I've tried to visit in the last half hour may, apparently, harm my computer. There's no link on the blocker page to carry on regardless, so I am expending many keystrokes more than I would like. Bad google. Fail.  <br/>Emma
