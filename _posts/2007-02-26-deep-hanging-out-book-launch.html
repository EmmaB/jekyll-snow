Everyone is welcome. There'll be an author reading and free drinks.

There have already been some great reviews of Richard's book:

"A really great story, fantastic. A fabulous ripping yarn that deserves to be read because it's just a really great properly-told story . . . fab."
BBC Radio Two Weekender

"Captures the languid confidence of youth, privilege and artistic ambition... Gwyn's humour is dark and knowing."

AND we are looking forward to reading The Guardian review sometime this week and seeing Richard's piece that he is writing for the Top Tens column.

Deep Hanging Out is going to be out in stores 1st March so look out for it!  <br/><h4></h4>
