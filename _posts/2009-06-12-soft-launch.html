I'm pleased to share with you <a href="http://www.cyclebooks.co.uk">www.cyclebooks.co.uk,</a> a new website we've created to share stuff on the, er, cycle books we publish. Go there now and sign up for freebies! It's brand new so we'll be adding to it as we go. And comments, critiques, thoughts very welcome as it's still in the development phase. Thanks! 

Oh, and this just in as I press 'post': National Bike Week at <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/index/index?b=221&t=618#Nationalbikeweek618">the Book Depository</a>!  <br/>Emma
