I understand that forms with my address on will contain mistakes. Despite the fact that most companies just ask for a postcode and a house number or name, and then look the rest up, there always seems to be a human element. But why would anyone design a computer system where you had to type in the names of the counties rather than select them from a list? And should I worry that I entrust my healthcare to people who think I live in 'Worikshire'?  <br/>Rob
