<a href="http://estellabooks.blogspot.com/2008/11/affinity-bridge.html">This </a>was a nice way to begin the day. Actually, that's not quite true - I'd already been at my desk for 40 mins. Ro, being smashing, is now pretty predictable with his sleeping so I get up an hour earlier than him and do the tasks that require two-hands-plus-bending-down - namely the filing and the paperwork. I think of it as an invigorating way to greet the day.  <br/>Emma
