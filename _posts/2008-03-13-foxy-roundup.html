This is rather circular, since their report just points back to this blog, but the Book Foxes have kindly included our win this week in their <a href="http://vulpeslibris.wordpress.com/2008/03/13/bookweek-round-up-7/">weekly book round up</a>. Go there now for other interesting news, including a summary of the reporting on The Friday Project and Litopia podcasts.  <br/>Emma
