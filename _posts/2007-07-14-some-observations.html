So Saturday so far has been spent proofreading. Question: how the hell do proofreaders earn a living? It takes hours and hours and hours. Maybe they just do it badly.  

Next observation: Dr Who. I don't miss it. When Buffy finished I was quite despondent for a week; when The West Wing finished I think I cried. Admittedly those shows were never coming back, and Dr Who will return in a matter of months. But I had got to the point where I approached each Saturday night's episode with dread, wondering what Russell T Davies had done this week to turn anticipation into disappointment. 

I know, I know. It's only TV. But good TV, like writing, matters. A bit, at least.
