It may sound dramatic, it may sound unimportant. But it is not. Do not use these fonts, ever, for any reason. Why? Because they offend the laws of design. I'm not going to explain any further; it's like having to explain why something's funny to someone with no sense of humour. Just... don't... do it. Please. 

//update - I've had to move the picture of the first offending font below the cut because I can't bear to have it on the blog.// <img alt="gigi.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/gigi.jpg" width="406" height="80" />
