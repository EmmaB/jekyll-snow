If your first thought upon visiting the blog today wasn't 'Green!', hit f5 or whatever the Mac equivalent is. After a preposterously nice spring day walk I thought I'd seasonalise the blog. Tell me if you can't bear it. 

I've also spruced up our <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/">home page </a>with something seasonal, and added a few more bits and bobs to the author pages of our authors who've sent in extras. A particularly fine browse can be had at <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Emson.html">Thomas Emson's </a>pages - see sections of the<a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/Emson_extracts.html"> original handwritten manuscript</a> of Maneater! I love looking at them - fascinating. If you haven't already seen it, you can read the <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/Bower_outtakes.html">'missing' chapter</a> of Sarah's Needle in the Blood, too. Go to the <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/snowauthors.html">author pages</a> and have a poke around.  <br/>Emma
