I get the occasional phone call from people who've just put the last flourish to their novel but who haven't given a moment's thought to getting it published. They rather unfairly ask me to tell them everything they need to know. Bugger that, frankly - have these people not heard of Google? Anyway, this post is for people who haven't got the first clue about getting their novel published.  <br/>Emma
