From today's Bookseller: 

"A disgruntled publisher called the Organ's offices last week, pleading for a moratorium on articles on rival independent Snowbooks. "How do they manage to get in the magazine so much?" he complained. The next day, the answer to Snowbooks' PR success arrived in the office--boxes of festive Snow Cookies for all. Bribery will get you everywhere."

Ooh, I do hope so. Thank you, The Bookseller, for writing such nice words about us throughout 2005. Back atcha.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
