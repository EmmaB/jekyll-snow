<a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/backroom">writing a website</a> for someone. And I think it's piggin' gorgeous. Ah, if only your website was as pretty and written in just one day. And I wrote <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com">snowbooks.com</a> myself, which took slightly longer but is now all zoomy and automated (Rob did a lot of the automation). Phreoooow.  <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">Email me </a>if you want me to make one for you (for money, let's be clear.)  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
