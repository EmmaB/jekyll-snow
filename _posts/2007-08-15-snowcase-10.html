The author of Snowcase #10, Anthony Black, is a former army officer and disaffected journalist. He has sent in 'The Failure', a 60,000 word novel.

A powerful metaphor for the Iraq war? Or the drunken ramblings of an angry newsreader? The Failure

I watch the news in the evening. The tsunami in South-East Asia is dominating the headlines. The footage is horrific, as expected, reinforcing my opinion of the outside world as a place to be avoided. Since going into broadcast journalism (I read the morning news at a local radio station; thats important), I breakfast on nothing but shit and misery, a diet which tends to dampen the appetite.

After the news I watch a programme called <i>What I Wish I'd Known When I Was Younger</i>. It's full of celebrities (but not the talentless, wanky kind) in their fifties and sixties, doling out wisdom. According to the radio presenter John Peel (recently deceased), it's all about 'finding a level, and operating on that level'. Finding happiness, that is. Resonates with me, because I've obviously not found my level.

Actually, that's not true. I am a newsreader, at least. (I do enjoy doing it, despite what I just said about it disagreeing with me. Perhaps it just compliments my already gloomy disposition. Anyway, I like the sound of my own voice. There, I said it.)

Unfortunately, reading the news is not enough for me. I want more than that. A higher level. I'm not just talking about happiness. I'm talking about something else.

<i>Boat drinks and bunny girls</i>.

I don't know where that came from, I really don't.

I go to work the next morning. The death toll is rising in South-East Asia. 

I watch a TV report from Banda Ache in Sumatra, where entire villages have been flattened. The correspondent describes a large, upturned boat in the harbour as 'smelling of lost souls'. What a twat.

Mid-morning, I start to get these pains in my chest. With a few minutes to go before my 11am bulletin, I ransack the newsroom, looking for the first aid box. I want some aspirin. Apparently that's the thing to take if you're having a heart attack.

I don't find any aspirin. I read the 11am bulletin unmedicated. It goes okay, the pain gradually dying away.

I decide maybe it was indigestion.

I go home at lunchtime and go for a run. My usual. Just over 3 miles, to the next village and back. Gets the old heart pumping again.

Post-lunch, I drink four cans of Carling, two bottles of Becks and a can of Heineken. A healthy, refreshing mix of lagers. I down most of them in front of the TV in my dressing gown.

This is all part of the journey. Greatness will come in its own time.
