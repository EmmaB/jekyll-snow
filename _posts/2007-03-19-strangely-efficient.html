Blimes - I don't know what happened there but I have had a phenomenally efficient day. I planned out what I was going to do for the week, and had it all done by 6pm! Go me. 

So as a treat to myself I ticked one of the things off the 'I'm never going to get around to doing this list'. <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/2004-7.jpg">Here,</a> for your delectation, is a timeline of all the books we've published. It's like a little history of Snowbooks. I like to look at the wide open spaces which signify that we went for months without publishing a single book, and ponder: how the hell did we get this far? I remember [leans on stick, squints into the distance] when we went eight months (Sept 05 - May 06) without receiving a penny in from sales, because we got hit by returns and weren't selling enough to cover the credit notes. How did we get by - with no bank borrowings, overdraft, shareholders or anything? 

I think I will indulge in a little bit of pride, looking back at this. Yey. We made it this far. Yey for us.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
