For InDesign geeks: When you select Edit Original and your .jpgs open in a viewer, rather than Photoshop, do this. Go to windows explorer and select Open With from the contextual menu, and select Choose program from list. Click on photoshop, and select 'Always use this program' at the bottom of the dialogue box. 

Then it works. The hours I've spent, the hours...  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
