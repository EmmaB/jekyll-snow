How cool is this: (from today's Publishing News) 

"SNOWBOOKS, THE INDEPENDENT founded in March 2003, whose MD Emma Barnes is also the entire sales force, has been shortlisted for the Lightning Source Small Publisher of the Year, alongside Profile, Atlantic and Serpents Tail. Barnes told PN: Were delighted  Ive just come down off the ceiling. Things are going well at the moment. We published 10 titles in our first year, 15 in our second, and now plan 25 for this year, including Plotting for Beginners, a Bridget Jones for the overfifties.
   The publisher has four full-time staff and believes it is possible to have success with the chains provided that you show them that you are professional, and that you take on board all their supply chain requirements. We have found central buyers very supportive.
   Two other shortlists have also been announced. Lynette Owen, Copyright Director at Pearson Education and a widely respected figure in international publishing, joins Susan Howe, Orion Rights Director, Sarah Thomson, Headline Rights Director, and Briar Silich, former Hodder Rights Director, on the shortlist for the Frankfurt Book Fair Rights Professional of the Year. Walker Books Operation Red Jericho sits alongside The Princess and the Pea (Puffin) and Macmillan Childrens Books editor Suzanne Carnell for the Poppy Red Award for Innovation in Childrens Publishing. Carnell is shortlisted for her work on Emily Gravetts Wolves. Walkers Operation Red Jericho is also shortlisted for the Stora Enso Design and Production Award.
   The Awards will take place on Tuesday, 9 May, on the closing evening of the BA Conference."

We are all going to go to the dinner in Bournemouth. I wonder if they'll let us have a snow machine going in the corner of the room? Subtle corporate branding, snow-stylee.  <br/>Emma
