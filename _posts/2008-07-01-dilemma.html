This is a gross, pregnancy-based dilemma, so I'm hiding the far-too-much-information-for-a-publishers-blog bit behind the cut. Those uninterested in pregnancy side effects, move along. It is a hot day. Do I: 

- drink sufficient water to keep hydrated EVEN THOUGH it means I have to get up from my desk to go to the loo about once every ten minutes (no exaggeration)

- get parched, but be able to sit in one place for long enough to be able to concentrate on my tasks. 

Tough one. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
