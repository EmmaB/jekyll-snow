To continue Em's gilded theme: a golden oldie. I've dug out my Sony Libri&eacute; from a few  years back. Any day now we're going to try the new Sony e-Reader, which I'm hoping will have an even better display. But as you can see, my slightly ag&eacute;d Libri&eacute; does very nicely in bright sunshine. It's infinitely better than a laptop or phone display, but there's still room for improvement. And before you all remind me that you'd rather have a paper book, you should know that this is a submission I'm reading, so my alternatives are either a  laser-printed brick; break out the guillotine, nipping-press and glue to make my own reader's copy; or read the thing on a computer screen. Oh, and to follow on from our earlier discussions about reading in bed, this gadget doesn't have that verso/recto problem that comes with resting your book on the pillow, where you find that for every other page you have to balance it on its edge - which often leads to holding the book in both hands in the air, the result of which is <em>libric brachial heat loss</em> (or 'cold arms while reading' as it's sometimes known). Whereas with this gadget  I can extend just a few fingers of one hand from under the duvet, tightening my grip occasionally to push the 'next page' button. Also, if you were a nerd like me, you'd think it was cool that the buttons are in Japanese.
