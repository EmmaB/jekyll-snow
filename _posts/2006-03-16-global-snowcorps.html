Sometimes we sit around poking at the holes in our socks, dreaming of the day when we earn a living wage and can afford tube ads. Sometimes we daydream a little too hard. Sometimes we imagine that in the future we will be huge and all-powerful and successful and all our books will sell half a million copies in the first week of publication. Sometimes we imagine that in the future we will have a forty-storey office tower in downtown Chicago atop of which will be a twenty foot high platinum snowflake, slowly rotating. Sometimes we imagine that on one dark day in the future the twenty foot high snowflake will fall off the building to the streets below and roll through the city causing damage and destruction, and it will be known as Black SnowDay. Sometimes we spend valuable publishing time creating new logos of our future company:

and writing lyrics for our Corporate Anthem: 

[To the tune of Handel's Messiah, the Hallelujah Chorus:]
 
Glo-ble SnowCorps, Glo-ble SnowCorps,
GlobalSnowCorps, GlobalSnowCorps, 
Glo-ble Snow-Corps!
 
Glo-ble SnowCorps, Glo-ble SnowCorps,
GlobalSnowCorps, GlobalSnowCorps, 
Glo-ble Snow-Corps!
 
It is right that you should fear
GlobalSnowCorps, 
GlobalSnowCorps,
Glo-buh-hul SnowCorps!
 
You can-not flee; it's always near
GlobalSnowCorps, 
GlobalSnowCorps,
Glo-buh-hul SnowCorps!
 
And so on.  With lots of big chorus voices, as George Harrison once said.

Sometimes we should just get on with our work.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
