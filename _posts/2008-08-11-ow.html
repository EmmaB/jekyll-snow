More pain. < mock wailing> Oh god, what have I done to deserve this? < /mock wailing> This time it's funny, though. I have been eating a bowl of strawberries, and absent-mindedly rubbed my eye which was sore. The strawbs must have been extra ripe or something, as I have now got loads of strawberry pips in my eye! My eye! Owowowww.  <br/>Emma
