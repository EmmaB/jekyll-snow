Well, in radio terms, the almost unthinkable has happened. A new series of<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00fbnb7"> Fags, Mags and Bags</a> has started and I've already missed a week. It's my favourite thing on radio, so that's quite a blow. BBC iPlayer will let me grab episode 2, but episode 1 is already lost to the ether. 10 days after broadcast the wavefront of the program will be around 260 billion kilometers from Earth, well beyond the orbit of Pluto. My chances of getting a radio and a tape recorder out there in order to record the programme are slim. So unless the BBC rebroadcasts it, or someone else on planet Earth decides to share their copy, I'll have to make do with the other five episodes of this series. But still, five episodes of radio comedy gold is cause for celebration. Unless something else goes wrong...  <br/>Rob
