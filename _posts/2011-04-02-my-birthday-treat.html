At last, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zzw1w">Fags Mags and Bags</a> - Radio 4's premier comedy programme - returns for Season 4. Tune in your wirelesses to the Light Programme at 11:30am on Monday, April 4th. It will be both amazing and great.

(And while I'm talking about lovely things on the radio, at some point I'll want to listen to Martin Sheen on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zzn2c">Desert Island Discs</a> this Sunday (11:15am). Can't wait to hear stories about The West Wing and the trail they've been running about the Democrat Party asking him to run for the Senate.)  <br/>Rob
