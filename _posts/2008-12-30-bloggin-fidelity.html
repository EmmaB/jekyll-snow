I can't bear the lies any more. I have to tell you something. I've been two timing you. Yes, I've been writing another blog for a few months - since Ro was born. Can you forgive me? Can we ever feel the same way about each other again? I can only say sorry, so many times. 

It's not a proper blog, though, really - it's just my journal of all things Ro (with the occasional comment of what it's like working from home with a baby as I currently do, which I thought might be interesting) before he suddenly hits 18 and I've forgotten how he grew up, so don't bother visiting unless you can stomach All Baby Photos, All The Time. But if you want to see some First Xmas photos, go <a href="http://www.wfhm.co.uk">here</a>.  

I'm sorry. It's me, not you. Can we still be friends?  <br/>Emma
