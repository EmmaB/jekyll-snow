On the subject of White magazine, I should reiterate that I welcome submissions from anyone - Snowbooks authors, hopeful Snowbooks authors, non-Snowbooks authors, the man down the street with the funny dog - on the subject of Writing Insights. I also welcome any sort of writing at all from Snowbooks' authors, ranging from poetry to extracts to photos of your cat. Really, there's very little I would say no to, because anything like this provides a window into your writing lives, and that's fascinating. So <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">email </a>away.  <br/>Emma
