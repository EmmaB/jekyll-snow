Mark at 5th Estate asked me to contribute to a <a href="http://fifthestate.co.uk/2008/02/bloggers-classic-love-stories/">love story post</a>, which in turn links back here. My contribution was about Oscar Wilde's The Nightingale and The Rose, one of my favourite short stories. If you'd like to read the whole story, <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/11/stories_that_make_me_cry.html#more">here it is. </a>  <br/>Emma
