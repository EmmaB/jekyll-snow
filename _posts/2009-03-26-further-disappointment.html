I'm just forecasting this next bit of disappointment, actually. Red Dwarf is coming back. I eager clicked on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/mar/26/red-dwarf-back-earth">trailer</a>. It was rubbish. It's going to be rubbish, isn't it? Rob Grant, where are you? Sigh.  <br/>Emma
