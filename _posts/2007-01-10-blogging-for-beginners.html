Oh, you may think <i>your</i> authors are clever, but how many of their main characters keep a blog?  For the past month, Sally Howe, heroine of <a href="http://snowbooks.com/web9781905005123.html">Plotting for Beginners</a> has been blogging about her life post-novel.  <a href="http://www.plottingforbeginners.com">Read it here.</a>  

I can't get enough of it (though I was quite partial to the novel in the first place!), and it's sure to be a favourite of those who enjoyed the book.  So check it out, fall in love, and buy the book.  Or, better yet, read the book first, then devour the blog, and finish by passing on the joy -- by buying another copy of the book for your best pal, of course!  <br/>Anna
