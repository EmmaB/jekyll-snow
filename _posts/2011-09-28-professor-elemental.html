Not strictly publishing-related, but this is the tune I'm listening the most to at the moment, as I make all my various important publishing decisions. Plus it's sort of steampunky. So I recommend it to you. 

Courtesy of Rob, please enjoy Professor Elemental's Fighting Trousers song.  "No, no jazz solo, this is supposed to be a diss song. Geoffrey, get off the drums."

Warning: if you say you like this, then I'll also post OK Go's version of the Muppet Show theme song.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
