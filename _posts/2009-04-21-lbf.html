So, Day One of the London Book Fair is over. All I had to do was stand up and occasionally hold a conversation and yet it seemed strangely exhausting. It's probably the contrast with my usual day of sitting down and occasionally pushing a button. Lots of interesting people have come by our tiny stand (which is in the IPG section of the floor). We've also had visits from a couple of our authors (I'm not contrasting that with 'interesting people', merely getting specific). <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Brackston.html">Paula Brackston</a> (pictured with Anna) has even gone to the extent of offering to fetch coffee when we needed it. We also had a  chat to the people of <a href="http://completelynovel.com/">CompletelyNovel</a> about what it is they do. I think I'm going to find out more but you can go and explore their site for yourself right now. There are books to read for free online - or you can buy a printed copy. You can likewise find an online home for your writing and have help self-publishing it and selling it through the site. And there's a community aspect with reviews and discussions and virtual book clubs and blogs. Plus, what imaginative new venture would be complete without a collection of three-minute video book <a href="http://blog.completelynovel.com/the-book-stop">reviews</a> complete with 'helpful' advice (I use those quotes advisedly)? I think the video book reviews are really a Machiavellian ploy to make Anna Lewis and her accomplices there seem likable. And it's working.  <br/>Rob
