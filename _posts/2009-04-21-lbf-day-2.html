Picking up the mantle where Rob left off, I report on LBF day 2. Another good but roundly knackering day. We met the new owner of our printer Haynes, now JF Print, and were thoroughly impressed with the steps the company is taking to become ever stronger. I think a trip down to Yeovil will come in the not too distant future. Rob and I saw an old chum from our Superdrug days - it's getting on for 15 years since we'd last seen each other which is slightly horrifying. We had some rights interest from some pretty cool publishers. And on the <a href="http://www.onixcentral.com">Onix Central </a>side of things, Robin had about a million meetings, all highly positive. 

And me? Rowan and I went together, so I arrived late and left early. But it was long enough to see some old friends, to make some new ones and to get that sense of invigoration, of new plans and opportunities, that comes from chatting and swapping notes at the Fair. 

And now, flicking through the papers whilst winding down for a good night's sleep in preparation for the third and final day, I read <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5191040/Astronomers-find-Milky-Way-could-taste-of-raspberries.html">this:</a> 

"Astronomer Arnaud Belloche said: <span style="font-family: courier;">"It [ethyl formate] does happen to give raspberries their flavour, but there are many other molecules that are needed to make space raspberries."</span>

Quality reporting at its finest.  <br/>Emma
