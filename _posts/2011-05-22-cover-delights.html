<a href="http://ianhocking.com/">Ian Hocking</a> is the author of Deja Vu*, and has just published his latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Flashback-The-Saskia-Brandt-Series/dp/B00520CYEI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1306048541&sr=1-1">Flashback</a>. I mention it because I did the cover art for it, and what's a girl to do on a Sunday afternoon if not parp her own trumpet a bit? 

I do cover art for other publishers, amongst other things, under the <a href="http://www.snowangels.org">Snowangels</a> consultancy arm of Snowbooks. <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">Shout</a> if you want to talk to me about that sort of thing.  

* I tried to get the e acutes and graves to work but, well, gave up. You know how to pronounce it, anyway. Not 'dedger'.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
