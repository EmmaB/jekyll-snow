James, with his <a href="http://www.booktwo.org">Booktwo.org</a> hat on, is doing an excellent <a href="http://www.booktwo.org/lbf2007/">minute-by-minute report </a>on the London Book Fair, in comparison to which a mere daily summary seems rather mean, but here is a sample of what I've got up to today. I am sure I've missed out huge things - my brain is mangled already - and bear in mind that this is only my day - G, J and A have had their own hectic schedules. Still, here we go. - 14 pre-planned meetings with the great and good, ranging from retailers to foreign sales agents representing countries as diverse as South Africa, the US and the Far East.  
- a chance meeting in the aisles with the delectable Mark from <a href="http://readysteadybook.com/">Ready Steady Book </a>/ The Book Depository who showed me a picture of his perfect new puppy. Eee!
- Bumped into Michelle from <a href="http://www.struiknews.co.za/oshunbooks/">Oshun,</a> finalist in last year's <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/arts-literature-iypy-2006.htm">IYPY award.</a> 
- a catch up with Roni Jay from <a href="http://www.whiteladderpress.com/">White Ladder. </a> I looked through an excellent book they're publishing called <a href="http://www.whiteladderpress.com/pages/store/products/ec_view.asp?PID=17">Getting Your Book Published </a>which I could see was invaluable at a glance. Highly recommended. 
- Picked up the latest Sarah Hall book from the Faber stand on the way out (sorry, I'll return it tomorrow) which is fabulous. Almost finished it on the journey! I love dystopian novels. 
- Met excellent printers Haynes. Of course, they're really publishers of the fine car manuals, but bless them they are vertically integrated - in other words they have brought printing in-house - and are selling their excess capacity, for a rather reasonable sum. Hooray! I may yet have that modest salary I keep hankering after. 
- And much more, including rights interests, kindness, journalists and a few brave authors trying to sell their wares. 

Tomorrow: zombies, 21 more meetings, and a party. Phew. <br/>Emma
