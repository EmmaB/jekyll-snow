And no, it's not recoverable. I've been trying to get back the quarter-hour of work I lost for about  half an hour (I know). I am greatly peeved. 

Update:

<a href="http://indesignhelp.com/repair-a-damaged-indesign-document/">Here is a useful page</a> for fixing InDesign docs. I used the 'move pages' resolution which seems to have worked - but of course had to go back to a version of my file that was missing my latest work. What an infuriating waste of an afternoon - not that I've lost too much work but that I've had to stabilise this important document. Bah. Minus one point to Adobe.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
