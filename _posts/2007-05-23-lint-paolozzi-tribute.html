From Steve Aylett, author of the peerless <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/lint/"><em>Lint</em></a>, we receive news of a recently-discovered Jeff Lint tribute.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Paolozzi">Eduardo Paolozzi</a>, the famous sculptor and artist, was apparently a great fan of Lint's work, taking inspiration from books including <em>Jelly Result</em> and <em>One Less Bastard</em> when creating such iconic works as the British Library's <a href="http://www.bl.uk/about/stpmap/piazza.html"><em>Newton, after William Blake</em></a>, and the proto-Pop <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=11350&searchid=8201"><em>I was a Rich Man's Plaything</em></a>.

However, surely Paolozzi's greatest work is that most derived from Lint's work, and shown above: a representation of The Caterer, Jeff Lint's most baffling creation, in <a href="http://www.thejoyofshards.co.uk/london/tcr/03.shtml">his famous mosaics at Tottenham Court Road Station</a>.
