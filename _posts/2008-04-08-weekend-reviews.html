A couple of belated reviews of weekend events. First the weather. There was thick snow. It was superb. My reaction to it was so joyous and wide-eyed it really does make me think that I need to go and live in Canada. Plus who wouldn't want to live in Canada?

Secondly, Doctor Who. <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/tv/2008/04/to_paraphrase_the_doctor_when.html">This Guardian reviewer</a> says it all. Running, shouting, sonic screwdrivers, rowing relatives. Unless the only criteria for success was 'must sound exciting when heard from the next room' I would have to rate it as a clanging gong, an empty vessel. (Psst. RTD, read my script. See how it's better than yours? Commission me. (Hmmm, that's probably not the way to get a job)).  <br/>Rob
