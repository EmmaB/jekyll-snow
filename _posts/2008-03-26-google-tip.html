I use this little Google feature pretty often and it occurred to me that not everyone might know it. If I want to find something in an old SnowBlog post, so's I can link to it, I can use Google to find it, I just preface my search with this: <span style="font-family: courier; color: gray;">site:www.snowbooks.com</span>. So if I want to find blog posts about rabbits, I type <span style="font-family: courier; color: gray;">site:www.snowbooks.com rabbits</span> and Google only shows me rabbit links from the Snowbooks site. (If you have a Google toolbar on your web-browser, you may have a button that looks like the thumbnail there which does the same thing. Go to the site you want to search, type your search words into the Google toolbar and then hit that button instead of just hitting enter and it's as though you typed <span style="font-family: courier; color: gray;">site:www.snowbooks.com</span>.) Best of all, you don't have to type <em>our</em> domain name; you can put any domain name in there. How versatile is that? <hr/>

Em did point out to me that if I looked around with my eyes, I'd see that ages ago she set up a search box over on the left-hand side of our website. Hmmm. Never noticed that. So you don't need to follow my advice for searching Snowbooks.com, only for other sites. <br/>Rob
