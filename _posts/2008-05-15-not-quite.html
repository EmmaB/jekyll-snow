Just read this in <a href="http://www.publishingnews.co.uk/pn/pno-news-display.asp?k=e2008051510094908&<=prop>&sg9t=0cee59b3ddb2bea94accfe9606b21401">Publishing News</a> which says we are developing the Bookbackers idea into something tangible and real, right now. There's no reason why they should know, I suppose, but we're not actively developing Bookbackers at the moment. We'd love to, of course, but the only way it will work is as an industry initative - hence the presentation at the BA conference in a session about industry wide initiatives. I got lots of good feedback at the conference, so do get in touch if you'd like to form a team to develop this idea. And bring your corporate credit card and diary, as it'll need money and time to work - another reason why we're not developing it immediately ourselves.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
