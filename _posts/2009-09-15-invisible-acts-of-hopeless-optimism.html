I was just cutting an itchy 'care' label out of a t-shirt and for the first time I noticed what it said. (No, that's not a picture of it, sadly. That's a funny internet picture I found <a href="http://carcino.gen.nz/images/index.php/00b9a680/6c489bdd">here</a>.) The two instructions were "Don't Iron" and "Dry Clean". The label writers have really reached for the stars there and I worry that their dreams are simply too beautiful for this world. But if my money-to-sense ratio ever gets significantly above one, I'll consider sending my $7 t-shirts out for weekly dry-cleaning instead of a run through the washing-machine and whisk over with an iron.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
