Is what we're having for dinner on Saturday. There's an <a href="http://www.scalinis.com/Bambino.htm">Italian restaurant</a> in Georgia, USA, which has a wall covered in photos of babies whose mothers ate this dish then went into labour within 48 hours. 

Bring it on. Auberginey goodness.  <br/>Emma
