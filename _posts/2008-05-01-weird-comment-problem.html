A couple of people have said they can't post comments on the snowblog. I have hit the server with an IT spanner and can't see an obvious problem, but if you do get stuck, feel free to use my email address where it says to provide your email. That should work. It's emma [@] snowbooks.com. 

And do let me know if you keep having a problem. Thanks!  <br/>Emma
