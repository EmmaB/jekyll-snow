Harumph. Our Wikipedia entry has been deleted by its editors because they didn't think we were notable enough. If anyone feels that wikipedia should, indeed, contain an entry about Snowbooks, maybe you should write one as it's not the done thing to write an entry about yourself.

'Not notable enough'. Way to make a girl feel special the weekend before she's up for <a href="http://www.britishbookawards.co.uk/bbia_shortlists.asp?">Young Publisher of the Year Nibbie</a>...  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
