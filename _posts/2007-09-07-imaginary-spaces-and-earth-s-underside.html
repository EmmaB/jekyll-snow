I think I might just point people to <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/">BLDGBLOG</a> rather than try to say anything very profound today. <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2007/05/undiscovered-bedrooms-of-manhattan.html">This post</a> echoes a dream I've been having since I was little (seven? eight?) that my grandparents' giant, dilapidated Victorian terrace house had at least one forgotten room which I would discover. Then <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/derinkuyu-or-allure-of-underground-city.html">this post</a> references it with some fascinating information about the sorts of things you might expect to find underneath Turkey.

And <a href="http://www.vanishingpoint.ca/daily/index.php?page=all.php">here is a library of pictures</a> that <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/drains-of-canada-interview-with-michael.html">one of the BLDGBLOG articles</a> links to.  <br/>Rob
