Very much enjoyed <a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/go/jkrowling.html">Joanna Rowling's speech</a> to the graduating class at Harvard (video and transcipt <a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/go/jkrowling.html">here</a>). I had a very similar conversation to her take on the virtues of failure quite recently.
<span style="font-family: courier; color: midnightblue;">"The first thing I would like to say is thank you. Not only has Harvard given me an extraordinary honour, but the weeks of fear and nausea Ive experienced at the thought of giving this commencement address have made me lose weight. A win-win situation! Now all I have to do is take deep breaths, squint at the red banners and fool myself into believing I am at the worlds best-educated Harry Potter convention."</span>  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
