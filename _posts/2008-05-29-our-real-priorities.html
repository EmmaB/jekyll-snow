I sort of feel this flap over fuel prices exposes our real state of preparedness - both mentally and in practical terms - when it comes to averting climate change. Of course, we're going to wean ourselves off fossil fuels in time to avert a global catastrophe. Bio-engineering technologies will save us. And Britain's green revolution is underway. Just don't for a second threaten our ability to burn at least as much fossil fuel as we did last year. Any risk of us having to use less petrol and suddenly it's pleading and threats to OPEC and talk of cutting fuel duties. I understand that people are suffering, but we knew this was coming. Is the plan really to save our civilisation by using up all the fossil fuel as quickly as possible?  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
