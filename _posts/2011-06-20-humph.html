My macbook pro is no longer with us, I'm sorry to say. Or, at least, it won't stay switched on. I've spent an uncomfortable day in Milton Keynes (why? why so many roundabouts? and don't all those people have jobs to go to?) which houses the nearest Apple store. They put a new hard drive in and said it was fine, but it ain't. So I'm going to buy a new computer tomorrow so I can send this one off for an extended fixin' holiday, and restore from backup, which just happens to be completely bang up to date. I find that one loses a significant amount of work due to spontaneous computer failure just the once, in each lifetime.  

Anyway, temporary glitch, but apologies if you've emailed and I haven't replied. I will do as soon as I'm back in the land of the computing. Hooray for time machine backups and cloud based version control, that's what I say, which makes this a hiccup not a monumental disaster.  <br/>Emma
