So why all the popping of corks, I hear you ask? Well, chums of Snowbooks, we have been <a href="http://www.ipg.uk.com/cgi-bin/scribe?showinfo=pp044">shortlisted </a>for Trade Independent Publisher of the Year at the forthcoming inaugural Independent Publishing Awards, along with Faber (Faber!), Profile and Milo. The award ceremony is after the IPG conference in Brighton (which, by the way, if you're an indie publisher you would be a fool to miss) in March so it's all fingers and toes crossed until then! 

The IPG website says: 

'Snowbooks earned a place on the shortlist for quickly building itself into a substantial force in the trade. "Snowbooks has been focused and energetic in its publishing, and its marketing and publicity has been outstanding." '

At the risk of being a bit gushy, thanks to all of you who support us so beautifully and make it possible for us to have really wonderful days like today. 

Wheee! (hic).  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
