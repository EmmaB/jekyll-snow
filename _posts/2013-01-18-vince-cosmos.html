Oh yes.  VINCE COSMOS - GLAM ROCK DETECTIVE comes out from illustrious Snowbooks (and others!) author Paul Magrs on Feb 1st. The website is www.vincecosmos.com to where I urge you to hot-foot it. It's a new audio drama starring JULIAN RHIND-TUTT (Green Wing, The Hour),written by PAUL MAGRS (The Brenda and Effie Mysteries, Doctor Who) and it's available on CD and download from BAFFLEGAB. Paul's last Brenda and Effie book "Brenda and Effie Forever" came out from Snowbooks last year and it's had a hugely warm reception from Paul's hugely warm fan base. You can buy it <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Brenda-Effie-Forever/dp/1907777814/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358511499&sr=8-1">here.</a> <br/><h4></h4>
