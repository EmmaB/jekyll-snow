Quick question: did anyone find my <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/11/scripting_tutorial.html">scripting tutorial</a> useful? Or have any comments or complaints? My impression is that there's not much interest in things like that (as you'll have gathered from its snarksome intro), but I thought I would give it a go. Happy to do more posts in that vein if they fulfil a need (maybe a scripting turorial for InDesign?); happy to focus on other things if they hold no interest.

<em>Update</em>: I think I might take that deafening silence as my answer. Gotcha: no InDesign or Photoshop scripting tutorials. <span style="font-size: 80%; color: gray;">Ungrateful swines.</span>  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
