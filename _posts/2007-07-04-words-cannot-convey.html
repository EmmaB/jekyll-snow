...the horror, shock, sadness and derision I feel upon hearing that <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/entertainment_304388a749b995fa82753e6d023e70a5.html">Catherine Tate</a> is going to be the new Companion. I utterly give up. Russell T Davies, you are *ruining* Doctor Who and it's not yours to ruin. It's going to be dire. I am so mad. 

Mind you, Alan Johnston was released. What a wonderful piece of news.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
