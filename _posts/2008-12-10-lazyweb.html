Anyone know of a good fast workaround to the fact that, if you apply object styles to grouped objects in Indesign, the style is applied to each of the objects? I want it to apply to the group as a whole (e.g. a stroke round the group rather than each object). I've tried nesting and creating a compound path to no avail. Thanks!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
