Not motivated by my love of books, but instead by my (newly discovered) love of fire, I'm linking you to an old news story about a fire in a gas pipeline last May. I don't know, there's something about a giant, churning fireball towering over suburban streets that sort of grabs my attention. (And since no one was killed I don't feel it entirely inappropriate to gasp in appreciation a little at the photos.) There's a bunch of them <a href="http://q-u-a-t-t-r-o.livejournal.com/191332.html">here</a> on this Russian blog that I can't read a word of - and elsewhere on the web if you care to look.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
