This is serious. I am relying on you here to pull one out of the hat. 

Your comrade and snowblog-reader-in-arms, <a href="http://www.kcoldiron.com/">Kat Coldiron</a>, needs your help. Go, buy and enjoy her short stories and help her out to retrain as she's getting laid off. 

I'm asking this as a personal favour - if you have ever enjoyed the Snowblog, do this for me.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
