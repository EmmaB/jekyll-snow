All you need to know about day 2: 

- Zombies! Invade LBF! Argh! Whilst they were lunging at the brains and necks of the great and good of the industry they were kind enough to promote our forthcoming Monster Island as well. 
- 21 meetings
- Got lost 4 times
- some really cool things happened and some really cool people were really keen on our books
- sooo tired. So tired. Tired. SO tired. tireee...
