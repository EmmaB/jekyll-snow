If you're waiting for a reply to an email you've sent me, sorry for the delay. I was on the road most of last week, first at the Gardners Trade show, then Windsor, then LBS in Worthing, then to London, and then in meetings all yesterday. So I have neither done much work nor answered many emails. I'm bound to have cleared most of them by Monday night, so shouldn't be too much longer. Thanks for your patience!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
