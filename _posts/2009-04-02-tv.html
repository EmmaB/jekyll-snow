I sometimes get confused: what are we here to talk about? Joss Whedon? Or was it indie publishing? Well, until I can get clear on that, I'd better make sure you're kept up to date with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss</a>-related news. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollhouse_(TV_series)">Dollhouse </a>will air in the UK on the (what now?) Sci Fi UK channel on Tuesday, May 19th at 9pm. Hmmm, that'll ensure it's a hit. For those of you who didn't know there <em>was </em>a Sci Fi UK channel, it's buried on your cable or Sky box planner somewhere, half a dozen pages below all the channels you've heard of.

And while we're on the subject of TV, Anna (the most blogwardly reticent of the Snowbooks team) will actually be in the UK on the 11th of April when the Doctor Who Easter Special is on. That means I won't have to record it, make a DVD, mail it to the U.S. and wait ten days for us to agree about how awful it was. Isn't that great?  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
