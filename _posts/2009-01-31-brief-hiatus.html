Sorry if you couldn't accss Snowbooks.com this morning. *Someone* put a very popular 59mb download on the homepage, downloads of which exceeded our bandwidth. Oops. 

Anyway, the latest <a href="http://www.snowsales.co.uk">Snowsales</a> post is up. If you are a student on a publishing course, you should ask me for the password. It is useful.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
