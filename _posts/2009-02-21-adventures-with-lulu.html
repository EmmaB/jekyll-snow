It's been great to hear all the positive feedback about our <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2009/02/early_birds.html">Interesting Experiment</a>. Your comments on this blog and on your own have been fascinating, and I'd like to incorporate some of your thoughts into this experiment. 

<a href="http://eoinpurcellsblog.com/2009/02/20/snowbooks-pull-a-genius-one/">Eoin</a>, for instance, wonders whether we could take it a step further and use this as a way to involve readers more in the process of creating a book. I love that idea, although I don't want to force people to have to spend money to give us useful feedback. So - if you send in proofreading notes for any of our proofs that you buy from Lulu, or give us some detailed, considered feedback, then I will refund you the price of the book. How's about that. Don't take the mick and point out one typo, though!  <br/>Emma
