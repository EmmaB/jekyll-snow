At the other end of the 'good supplier' spectrum, I have today taken three phone calls, from the same chap, who does not own a computer. He would like to submit his novel - which he has typed on a typewriter - to Snowbooks. I have tried to explain that not only do we have staff based 4000 miles apart, which means email is our preferred means of communication, but that we would struggle to have a meaningful working relationship without his being online. He didn't know what 'online' meant, and although I tried he couldn't fathom why I wouldn't agree to accept his typewritten manuscript. 'Even if I hand deliver it to the office?' he asked. Even then. 'But it's 200,000 words!' All the more reason not to chop a tree down. 'And how long has the company been established?' I'm dreadfully sorry, I'm rather busy and all the information is on our website. 'Website, dear?' 

Phone call number two was to clarify our postcode. 'N for nothing, one, nine, J for Jezebel, N for nothing?' 

Phone call number three was to ask whether Staples was a good place to buy an email address. I suggested he go to his local library and ask for help there. I hope the concept of a library isn't too modern for him. 

Yes, I am being tough on him - probably over-tough. But he has taken up a half-hour of my day because he scorns computers and 'all that email nonsense.' And I tell you what - if his book's the best book I've ever read; if it's sweeping in its scope and reduces me to impassioned tears, there's no way on earth we're publishing it. There's more to being an author than being able to write.  <br/>Emma
