I don't want to get too carried away about this, because there's nothing special about eagles. They may be symbols of majesty and the glories of nature, but so are stoats and butterflies, in their own way. But honestly: a golden eagle has been <a href="http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/latestnews/Flying-school--Methuselah-must.3848555.jp">just been released</a> from captivity after 27 years. 27 years in which it didn't have enough room to get properly airborne. And now it's spreading its wings and learning to fly again. Literally for once. The symbolism centres of my brain are overloading. Three cheers for letting great big old eagles out of their cages.  <br/>Rob
