If you watched and enjoyed <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/01/creating_a_catalogue_in_about.html">the video </a>about making an XML-based catalogue in InDesign, you'll like this. We're licensing the XSL to you under one of the most liberal Creative Commons licenses. <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/inddxslt.xsl">Download the XSL file.</a> This license lets you tweak, and build upon our work even for commercial reasons, as long as you credit us and license your new creations under identical terms. 

Use the XSL as shown in the video to transform your raw ONIX message into cut down XML that contains only the content required for the catalogue, in the right order. 

If you get stuck, or would like us to tweak the code for your own purposes, we'd be happy to help - for a modest fee. <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">Get in touch. </a>
