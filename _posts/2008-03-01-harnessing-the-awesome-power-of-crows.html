Could there ever be anything better <a href="http://www.wireless.is/projects/crows/">than this</a>: a crow-operated vending machine? It rewards crows who put coins in it: they get snacks. At first coins will be left around for them to pick up. But eventually the crows will have to search out the coins. And if I may add my own 'eventually', eventually they will learn to steal coins.  <br/>Rob
