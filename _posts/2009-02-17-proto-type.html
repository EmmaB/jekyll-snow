Why draw letters by hand? Why not make up little punches for each character and use them over and over? Just think of the possibilities. But when was movable type invented? And if the answer was 1700BC then why didn't it catch on? Of course if the Phaistos disk is wrongly dated or a fake then that latter question goes away. But just in case you haven't heard of it, I thought I might direct you to the relevant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaistos_Disc">Wikipedia entry</a>.  <br/>Rob
