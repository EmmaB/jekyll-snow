It's Snowbooks' fifth birthday today. We'd have posted about it earlier, but Em and I have been out and about all day. The thumbnail shows a picture of one of the many things we saw on our travels. Click on it to get a better look. Note the jaunty gait. Both hind paws are off the ground as it trots. Think of it as an ovine simile for how we feel. Snowbooks still seems new and full of bounce to us. And quite smiley. But to see an illustration of that you'll have to click 'Continue...' and go on to the next picture. <img alt="smilinglamb.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/smilinglamb.jpg" width="500" height="469" /> <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
