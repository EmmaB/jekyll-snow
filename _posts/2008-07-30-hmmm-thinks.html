Many of you will know what's wrong with the Far Side cartoon in the thumbnail. I mean beyond Penguins not having speech or names and Polar Bears not making or using disguises. Yes, it's the fact that Penguins and Polar Bears live twelve thousand miles apart with no prospect of making the crossing through the equatorial tropics. Without help that is. I mean, Polar Bears are going to go extinct soon because there'll be no ice at the North Pole in the Summer. What do you suppose would happen if they were relocated to the South Pole? Be a shock for the Penguins I'm sure. But it might keep the bears alive at least until we run out of things to burn and the temperature comes down again.  <br/>Rob
