I have had a query from one of our authors on all this office moving malarky, so here is a clarificatory note. 

The Snowbooks office remains at 120 Pentonville Road where we enjoy the friendship and neighbourliness of our landlords <a href="http://www.kogan-page.co.uk/">Kogan Page</a>. I will work from there Thursday and Friday every week, at least. I will work from home (in the country) Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday most weeks. However, it will vary a lot, as in the exciting world of publishing no two weeks are the same. For the purposes of post, telephones and meetings, nothing has changed, and our London office is our main home. 

Hope that's clear.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
