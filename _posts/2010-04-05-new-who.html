Just in case anyone would like my non-spoilery verdict on the first new episode of Doctor Who, here it is:
<table class="tab"><tr><td>New doctor</td><td>Not sure yet</td></tr><tr><td>Scriptwriting</td><td>Brilliant!*</td></tr><tr><td>New companion</td><td>Brilliant!</td></tr><tr><td>Rescored theme music &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Not too impressed</td></tr><tr><td>Optimism levels</td><td>High</td></tr></table>

*clever interlocking plot points that actually make sense, nicely handled pivotal character moments and a welcome absence of overwhelming existential angst.  <br/>Rob
