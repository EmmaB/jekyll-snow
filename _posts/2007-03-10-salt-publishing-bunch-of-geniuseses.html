Salt Publishing are an extraordinary company. Every time I visit their site I marvel at everything about them - their design prowess, their genius IT (better than snowbooks', even, and I'm reet proud of ours), their approach, their list. <a href="http://www.saltpublishing.com/">Visit them now</a> - their site says more, and better, things about them than I ever could. A truly wonderful company.  <br/>Emma
