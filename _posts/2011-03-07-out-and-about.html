So Ro is on the mend (no temperature, no pain relief today and was in a chirpy, bobbly mood), thank god. No more hospital, hooray, with its annoying flickering fluorescent light that is slightly out of step with the smoke alarm light just next to it (except for once every 28 minutes when they briefly synchronise. I have stared at that hospital ceiling a lot.) 
And so I thought I'd go to the Independent Publishers Guild conference which is this week. If anyone's going, it would be lovely to see you. I've been a bit of a screenhead for the last few months (believe it or not, those people who are still waiting for me to do things) and haven't seen, you know, humans, that much. I am the sort of person who likes her own company, but when the primary human contact you have are removals men, the milkman (yes, I have one and no, it's not a euphemism), medical staff and worried parents of sick children, I suppose one should make the effort to get out a bit. So I'm looking forward to a mingle. See you there!  <br/>Emma
