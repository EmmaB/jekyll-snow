In my opinion, capitalism is a tractor. Compared with using your bare hands, it's amazing, a marvel. But you have to steer it, whatever the free-market folk tell you. Otherwise it plows up the garden as well as the field and then crashes into your house. 
Opinions like mine have been pushed to the fringe for a while, but it seems as though they could become mainstream again. I might no longer be off the left-hand end of the spectrum. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/06/economics.economy">Madeleine Bunting</a> in the Guardian today has what I consider to be a lot of wise words on the subject.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
