We went through a spell on the blog here where I'd write something fibrous and indigestible about exchange rates or the evolution of language and then Em would follow it up with a link to <a href="http://www.cuteoverload.com/">Cute Overload</a>. Today, finally, the tables are turned. Em has served up a plate full of maths and I'm directing you to a story about a horse with stumpy legs that people keep thinking has sunk into the mud when it hasn't. See <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/mar/12/short-legged-horse-rescue-mayflower">here</a>.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
