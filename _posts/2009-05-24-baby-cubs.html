My mum seems to have horrible rolly-polly baby fox cublets lolloping around her garden and play-fighting. Urr. Keep reading to see how unappealing they look. I only had my point-and-shoot camera with me, not my DSLR, so the camera insisted on doing its own thing - which is to say, it tinkered with its focus and dithered about what exposure it wanted to use instead of getting on with taking pictures of grubby fuzzy little foxlings. So they're not very good pictures at all. And of course I'm to blame at least as much as my camera. Anyway, I'm hoping next time they appear I can get pin-sharp close-ups of their unpleasantly fluffy little noses. <img alt="Fox1.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/Fox1.jpg" />
