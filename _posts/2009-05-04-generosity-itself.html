My PC has been struggling recently: a bit slow, unable to process a few ActiveX thing - so I downloaded and bought a scan thing to fix the registry. It seems to have done the job. Hooray. I bought three licences for three computers since that was the same price as one computer, and gave one to my husband - so now I have one licence going free. Want it? Email me and I'll send you the licence key! Think of it as your Bank Holiday present from Snowbooks.  <br/>Emma
