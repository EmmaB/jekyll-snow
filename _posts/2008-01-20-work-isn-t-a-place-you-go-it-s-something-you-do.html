I've been getting on very well with working from home because I am both a morning and night person, and less of an early afternoon person. It means I can get up early(ish) and get straight to work, without wasting my productive hours on a commute (although I do think an early morning cycle is a great way to wake up). Then I can get a bit lazy around lunchtime, make some food, perhaps, as has happened a few times since Andy gave me the complete Buffy DVD set (all 7 series. Yes, I am married to the perfect man) even watch an episode of Buffy whilst having my soup, or go for a walk or meet Rob for lunch in Chipping Norton. Then I can do easy tasks until I take advantage of the fact that my brain kicks back into gear around seven in the evening, and have another blast at the important stuff until bedtime.  All of which is why <a href="http://www.mavericksatwork.com/?p=108">this post </a>was particularly interesting - about companies who are realising that giving people the freedom to work in the way that suits them best is a sensible idea. Have a read. I bet your company doesn't work like that. Maybe you should forward it to your boss.
