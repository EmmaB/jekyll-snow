For a very pregnant lady, I sure do work hard. I worked the weekend (on a totally cool XSL thing which you wouldn't be interested in, though) and today I've shot through my to do list - which means I am allowed a ten minute break to bring you what I think is The Best of The Current Cute Overload postings. <a href="http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2008/10/demanding-relen.html">1) Covered in kittens</a>
<a href="http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2008/10/its-caturday-il.html">2) Disgraceful layabout</a>
<a href="http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2008/09/cute-overload-i.html">3) Chipmunk sandwich</a>
<a href="http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2008/09/cranky-bunny-ne.html">4) Disapproving rabbit</a>

The SnowBlog: scouring other blogs for the best bits so you don't have to. Now, back to work. 

(Oh, and please don't succumb to the urge to advise me on ways to induce labour. No offence, but nothing you say is going to be relevant!) <br/>Emma
