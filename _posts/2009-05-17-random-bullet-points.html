* Am I missing something? People are much more annoyed that MPs put a flat-screen telly on expenses than that they illegally invaded a Middle East country?
* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollhouse_TV_series">Dollhouse</a> has been renewed for a second (cheaper) season. Hopefully they'll get the kinks out now.
*John Lewis have exclusive UK rights to sell the red version of the Sony e-book reader. But bizarrely their sexy gadgets catalogue in the Sunday papers calls it a 'portable audiobook' and suggests you need headphones for it. (It'll play MP3s but that's hardly its function.) Strange to get an exclusive deal on a device you don't understand.
* If you saw in the news that a place that trains firefighters caught light - and most of the fire damage was to their collection of fire engines (oops) - you might like to know that's where my local gym is. Finally, a satisfactory excuse for not going - at least until they tidy up.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
