It's nearly that time of year again. I'm rather looking forward to it this time. Anna is flying over from the Americas and we will spend the week enthusing, being polite to strangers, repeating ourselves, and looking forward to whatever it is we will eat that evening*. Also, and this is shocking news to anyone who knows her, Anna drinks ALCOHOL nowadays so who knows what the week will be like? I will be sure to carry a camera at all times of the day and night. Anyway, the reason for this post is that if any industry folk who are reading are going, and would like to meet me and Anna, then please email or leave a comment soon, as the diary is filling up. See you there! 

*Last year we even made up a song about what we were going to eat. It went thus: 

Spring rolls, spring rolls,
Sweetandsoursaucenoodlesrice, 
Spring rolls, spring rolls,
Sweetandsoursaucenoodles Rice!

Guess you had to be there. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
