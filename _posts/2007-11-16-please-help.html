Please, please log on to <a href="http://www.worldbookday.com/spreadtheword">www.worldbookday.com/spreadtheword</a> and vote for Adept, Needle in the Blood and Lint! They've just made the site live, and there are no votes or comments yet so I'd love it if we got off to a strong start and made sure that our books are the ones people are talking about. 

I will love you forever if you do. And will probably send you prizes to say thank you. A bit of honest bribery never hurt. 

//update - lordy, on behalf of the organisers I do apologise for their site. I have told them the errors we're all getting, and asked for a single page with all the titles clearly laid out so you can just scroll down. Thanks for your patience. I'd suggest that you don't try to access the site yet and I'll tell you when it's working properly. Sorry for wasting your time. //  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
