You know when you arrive in a new country, your cell phone will often get a text message from whichever local network your phone has logged onto. I've just been playing with the phone I used last time I was in the States and noticed one of those. What's cool about it, is that it's for a Canadian phone network and says 'Enjoy your stay in Canada'. Well, I didn't visit Canada. I just flew over it for a couple of hours. Bad me for not correctly engaging flight mode on that phone. But it's pretty cool that it logged into a phone network while we were whizzing through the sky.  <br/>Rob
