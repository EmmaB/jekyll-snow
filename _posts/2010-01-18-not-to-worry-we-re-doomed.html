So you know Steve Jobs? The guy who resuscitated Apple computers and brought the iPhone into being? He's a bit of an electronics industry legend and guru. This is what he said a little while back about handheld e-readers:

<span style="font-family: courier; color: darkred;">"It doesnt matter how good or bad the product is, the fact is that people dont read anymore,"</span> he said. <span style="font-family: courier; color: darkred;">"Forty percent of the people in the U.S. read one book or less last year. The whole conception is flawed at the top because people dont read anymore."</span>

Just thought you'd like to know. (Source article <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/the-passion-of-steve-jobs/?ex=1358226000&en=dc35254b0fcd5490&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">here</a>.)  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
