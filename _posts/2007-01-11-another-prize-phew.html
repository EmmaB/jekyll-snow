Oh we're *always* winning prizes. We have *so* many prizes that it's quite tiring keeping up with how many *hundreds* of prizes we have won. Phewfo. 

Seriously, though, we've won a prize! Us and Alma books won 3:AM's <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/buzzwordsblog/2006/12/3am-awards-2006.html">Publisher of 2006 </a>prize. Yey! It is neither here nor there that we published an <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005208.html">excellent anthology </a>of writing from 3:AM in 2006. Neither here nor neither there. 

We didn't actually *get* a trophy though, or anything. Hint.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
