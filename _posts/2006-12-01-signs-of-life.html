Hooray, signs of life! Finally sales appear to be taking off a bit. We have had excellent reorders on our fiction and the Omnibus still hangs in there at number 10 in the chart. Phewo. There's still some work to be done on the non-fiction, so please do consider some of our books for Christmas presents. At least I can ask this now without a kind of warbling desperation in my voice. 

I have been in or around retail for over ten years and *every* Christmas I panic. And *every* Christmas it turns out OK. When will I learn?  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
