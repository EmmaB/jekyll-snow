The first email of the week - the *very first email* - is a request from a customer to authorise returns of more than 3000 units across four titles. 

There is a shop two doors along from the office called Pentonville Rubber. They sell foam, rubber mats and bean bags in horrible colours. There is no parking. Their window is broken. The foam is all discoloured round the edges. And how much demand for rubber mats can there possibly be? Sometimes I wonder how they stay in business. 

Today, I'm thinking that their industry looks a damn sight easier than mine.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
