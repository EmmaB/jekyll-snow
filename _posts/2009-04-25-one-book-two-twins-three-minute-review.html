I mentioned <a href="http://www.completelynovel.com/">CompletelyNovel</a> the other day, and wouldn't you know it, they recently video-reviewed one of our books in their inimitably quirksome way. This particular review is by CompletelyNovel's Anna and her twin sister, George. They took a crack at <em>Underlife </em>by Robert Finn, and they liked it. And as they point out, you can read it For Frees, because the publisher (that's us) has made it <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/RobertFinn/">available to download</a> on a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/">Creative Commons licence</a>.  <br/>Rob
