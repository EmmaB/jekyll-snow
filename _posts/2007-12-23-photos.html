So click on the photo to the left. Nothing too notable about it, you might think. An unspectacular sunset. Except I took that photo this morning before dawn. That's the moon. Really. (Sorry it's blurred. It was a long exposure and I've lost the bit that clips my camera to its tripod. Grrrr.) Here's another photo taken just after dawn a couple of days ago when there was a heavy frost. I think if one is going to cover the world in crystals, it's a nice idea to add some pink to the sky. Good job, world.

And finally, a new addition to my household. That's a Sony Reader <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRS-505">PRS-505</a>. Or the corner of one. It took me maybe 2 minutes to download a free* e-book and copy it across. I could have added fifty books in about twice the time. As you can see, that display is pretty good**. And it contains an MP3 player too. I don't expect to use it, but I like the idea that I can listen to audio books or have it play me tunes while I read. For Christmas I might see if I can find a copy of Thomas Jefferson's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Bible">bible</a> and have a read of that.
