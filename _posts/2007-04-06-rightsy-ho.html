It's the London Book Fair a week on Monday. We are at stand J205 and you should visit us, for there will be seats and fruit and water, and if you're a veteran fair-goer you'll know that those things are prized commodities. And while you're there, buy the rights to a territory of one of our books. Oh, go on. Just a little territory. How about the Fiji islands? Or Tuvalu? If a couple of you get together, you might be able to go halvoes on Estonia. <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/rights%20guide%202006-7web.pdf">Download our rights guide here.</a>

(The beady among you may notice the date, which indicates that I am working on the Bank Holiday weekend - no clever time-delayed posting on this blog. You should <em>definitely</em> feel obliged to buy some rights now that I've gone to the trouble of coming in to the office to do the guide. Roll up.)  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
