Now normally I respond very badly to negative feedback. Very badly indeed. I beat myself up, as it were; I become convinced that the person telling me that I / my company/ my books are crap is right and I am wrong; I obsess, worry, apologise and generally feel very miserable about the whole thing. But today I received a letter through the post with this in it, which made me, well, laugh my head off: 

<img alt="mental.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/mental.jpg" width="360" height="538" /> [dries eyes, tries to calm down from hysterical laughing]

It is the acknowledgements page ripped from a copy of The Needle in the Blood by Sarah Bower and sent in anonymously. This is a book that has won heartfelt praise from many readers who have really loved it. It is a work of art; a wonderful novel. Although clearly this seems to have passed one reader by.

This person has taken the time, trouble and stamp to send a note that I think belongs in... Well. Let me stop there. Over to you. Firstly, feel free to provide your own opinions of Needle in the comments. Secondly, if there are any budding or seasoned handwriting experts out there, care to try to infer from this charming scrap of paper what this reader's personality might be like? <br/>Emma
