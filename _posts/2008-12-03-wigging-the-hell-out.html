You spend your days with books. Books are static, visually uniform and very few people have phobias about them. Maybe that means you're mentally well-balanced, and it will take more than a mere image to ruffle your feathers. Or maybe being around books has failed to prepare you for the 'real' world. It's made you bookish: delicate, sensitive, easily alarmed. Whichever it is, consider whether or not you have any crab-related hangups before clicking on the picture that accompanies this post. Doing so will take you to a picture of that critter as you might encounter it in real life - if you lived in Guam.
