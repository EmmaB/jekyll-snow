I've got to say, I don't give a rat's whiskers about the Olympics. However, apparently Team GB (yey, go us, bleaurgh) have just won some cycling races. So in the spirit of very half hearted marketing, please now be encouraged to consider buying one of our cycling titles (which are much more interesting and relevant than the poxy Olympics).

Both look nice. Both smell nice. Both are written by experts. Both will last you a lot longer than any excitement you might feel about the Beijing Games.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
