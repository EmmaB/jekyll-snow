I hope the training day last week was useful for delegates: it was certainly useful for us because of the great ideas that flowed throughout the day on improvements and additions to Bibliocloud. Here’s a summary of the ideas we noted which will be rolled out as part of Bibliocloud over the next few months.

(edit: I'm updating the list below as we work through the additions.) We’ll make the system detect when a contact’s name is a duplicate of one that’s already on the system, dependent on the contact’s type. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll add a role name or photo to the Contact index page so it’s clearer which contact is which when there’s a shared name. DONE: you'll see the change on the Contact index page. You can now add photos to each contact: look for the new tab called "Files" when you're editing your contact data. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll add a word counter on marketing text fields. DONE: you will see a word counter on every marketing text field when you're editing your works. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll add a search function to all pages, including the AI archives page. 
<br/><br/>

We’ll make the AI archive easier to manage, so that there’s only one current version but there’s still a useful history of previous versions, and frontlist and backlist versions. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll build in the option to automate the transmission of ONIX data, whilst retaining the option to control when data is sent. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll add a bulk-paste option to the search area on works and editions so records can be identified through pasting ISBN lists. DONE: simply paste a list of ISBNs into the search bar of any one of the Works, Works Proposals, Editions or Editions Proposals index pages. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll consider adding the option of calculating royalties based on a profit share
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll add reporting in to aggregate reporting on contribution etc
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll buff and polish the payment type for fees section. 
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll include rights revenue in the profit report
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll look at automatically importing clients’ PayPal sales
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll make it possible to generate QR codes and look at a QR/barcode reader for use when hand-selling books.  DONE: see http://youtu.be/zufPdUAB28Q
<br/>
<br/>
We’ll add in a lot more functionality around forecasting, production and reporting. 
<br/>
<br/>
Since the training day we’ve started implementation of a change log which should be available in the next few days. We’ll let you know when it’s ready to look at. 
<br/>
<br/>
As ever, if you think of any new ideas to add into Bibliocloud, don’t hesitate to tell us! <br/>
