I've made a few tweaks to the website content today. I haven't touched it for ages, but now that James has gone to the bother of giving it a lick of paint I thought I'd have a spring clean. So there are a couple more FAQs added and a bunch of downloads and a timeline on the Press page. (I may have got all the dates wrong on the timeline - I'll have to check with everyone on Tuesday.) I am also going to improve the Bookseller page for our international customers, but that will be later in the week when I have the right info to hand. 

I'm also slightly grumpy this morning, despite the lovely sun, because I get sales data on a Saturday and this week our sales were minus &pound;2000. That is because of returns from October. October! Honestly. 

Ok, off to cheer myself up by going to see some <a href="http://www.fleshmob.co.uk/">zombies</a> now, because that is how normal people spend their Saturdays. More later.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
