List the textbook, clich&eacute;d uses of the Internet and 'looking up movie times' is probably in the top ten. But here's a thing: I've almost never managed to look up movie times on the Internet. Whichever site I use tends to shut down or start charging. I was delighted to find Google/movies a few months ago, but I just tried it and it doesn't contain any listings. In theory, as someone who thinks they know about web stuff, I should have been planning my cinema trips online for at least ten years now. With that in mind, if anyone can help me finally get started, a decade late, I'd be much obliged. (Bear in mind, I'm not in London or America.)  <br/>Rob
