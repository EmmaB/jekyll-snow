If you're not sure what we won that Nibbie for last night, here's our <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/innovation.pdf">entry form</a> (pdf, 165kb) which should make it a bit clearer. We can do this stuff for your business too, comparatively cheaply, so <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">drop us a line </a>if you'd like to save several months' time a year.  <br/>Emma
