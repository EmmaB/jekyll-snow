I think my mistake in <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/10/why_you_need_to_be_a_computer.html">Part I</a> was couching my pro-technology argument in technological terms. It's just dawned on me that there's a better way to make my point. And it's this: if you had to choose, which would you prefer to be: an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eloi">eloi</a> or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morlock">morlock</a>? I'm promoting the Morlock camp. <span style="font-size: 80%; color: gray;">And remember, for all their happy picnicking, the Eloi couldn't read and could hardly talk.</span>  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
