I would recommend, my friends, that you head on over to <a href="http://andyremic.wordpress.com/2010/07/21/guest-blog-apocalyptic-zombie-wayne-simmons/">http://www.andyremic.com/</a> to read a corking guest post from our very own Wayne Simmons on how apocalypse, amongst other things, frees us from bureaucracy.  <br/>Emma
