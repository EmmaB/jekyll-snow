Oh, look, it's Seldom Heard-From Anna!  I live in America and look the other way, distractedly, when people tell me I should blog about things!

But not today -- no -- because today I discovered that <a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2007/06/book_review_mon.html">Wil Wheaton likes Monster Nation</a>.  Here at Team Snowbooks, we're all fans of ST:TNG (to the point that we use acronyms), but beyond that, I've come to appreciate Mr Wheaton as a well-spoken (written), intelligent individual with uncommonly good tastes.  He enjoys the zombies, so you will too!

And if you don't, well. . . we'll just have to send the zombies after you, won't we?  <br/><h4>Anna</h4>
