If you've been keeping up with the iPad-launch hype but you'd like some ammunition to fire back with, Ars Technica have a veerrry detailed <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2010/04/ipad-review.ars/">review</a> that points out heaps of drawbacks and caveats. You could just learn about the problems using the device to read books if you wanted. Or go on a negative spree and read the lot. 

Not that any of that puts me off. I'll still get one. Even seeing the iPad referred to as a 400 Etch-A-Sketch only serves to amuse (but not dissuade) me. We don't mind the nasty words, do we Prrrrecious.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
