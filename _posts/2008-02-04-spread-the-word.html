I'm dead chuffed to announce that <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/lint">Lint </a>has<a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/news/52475-world-book-day-picks-books-to-talk-about.html"> made it onto the shortlist </a>for the World Book Day Spread the Word competition - and it's all down to you. Thanks so much for voting, and not rebelling when I went on and on and on about it. 

I'm a bit mopey about the others not getting a look in - Needle in the Blood, The Red Men and Adept - so keep talking about them to your friends!

Sincerely, thanks so much for all your support. You did it! 

Oh, and by the way, can you do it again? The votes go back to zero, so if you voted before, would you vote again to make Lint THE book to talk about? You are smashing. x  <br/>Emma
