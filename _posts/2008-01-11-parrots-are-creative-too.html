I try to restrain myself from simply posting most of the links that <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a> turn up, but every few days I like to let my creative standards slip and do just that. <a href="http://blip.tv/file/520347">Here</a> is a link to a video announcing the newly minted commemorative U.S. coins and the 'glorious' deeds they recall. If you - like me - are a fan of hearty satire with a stylish retro feel to it, you will enjoy many mirthful chuckles at this beautifully crafted presentation. (And then feel a bit sad afterwards.)
