Here's a good thing. My friend Verity (<a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2009/04/veritys_island.htmll">remember</a>?) is back on dry land for a few minutes, which means she's got the bandwidth to transfer some photos from her camera onto the world wide internet. So if you've enjoyed reading her earlier posts, you might want to <a href="http://atraineewarden.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2009-04-14T19%3A36%3A00%2B01%3A00">go back</a> and look at the photos and drawings as they gradually get added.  <br/>Rob
