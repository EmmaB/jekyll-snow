... and the previously extremely fat goose has got a bit thinner. Now I'm more than half way towards my goal I can reveal the awful truth about my pregnancy weight gain. Five (count 'em) stone, ladies and gentlemen. Yep. Heffer. I'm glad to report, however, that I've lost three of the buggers and have achieved my Christmas gift to myself of being only [mumblesomethingmutter] stone. Another two stone to go and I'm back to my pre-pregnancy weight (plus a bit less because if I have to go to this much bother I may as well get a bit thinner than I was before.) I don't think I look two stone overweight at the moment, mainly because I usually have a baby strapped to my front which disguises a number of sins. So it's all good. 

Needless to say, of course, I shall be enjoying a huge Christmas lunch tomorrow. Everyone's coming round our gaff because Ro's too little for a long drive so it's going to be ace. I've just laid the table and have spent much of the day decking the halls with boughs of holly, literally. And it's the cats' first proper Christmas as I'm normally elsewhere. And of course it's Ro's first. So all in all I'm feeling jolly festive. And I hope, gentle snowblog reader, you have a lovely day whatever you're doing, and Merry Christmas. <br/>Emma
