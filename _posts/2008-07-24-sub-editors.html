Don't get me wrong - I'm grateful whenever publications give us coverage. But since Rob and I have been on the receiving end of weird sub-editing more often than not - sub-editing that strips out all the jokes, changes the meaning of the writing and makes me look stupid - I did appreciate <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jul/23/mediamonkey">this email</a> written by food critic Giles Cohen to his subs at The Times. Warning: contains plenty rudewords.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
