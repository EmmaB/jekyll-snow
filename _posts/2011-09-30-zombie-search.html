Now, I can't say as I really understand <em>why</em>, but the chaps and chapettes of the Oxford Internet Institute have plotted instances of people performing zombie-related internet searches on a map of the world. The results (see <a href="http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/vis/?id=4e813bd2">here</a>) correlate pretty well with  the English-speaking parts of the world. Which means, in the words of the report: "<span style="font-family: courier; color: darkred;">The results either provide a rough proxy for the amount of English-language content indexed over our planet, or offer an early warning into the geographies of the impending zombie apocalypse.</span>" I believe SnowBlog readers are particularly well equipped to judge for themselves which of those two possibilities is the most likely.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
