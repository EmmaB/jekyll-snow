I have got this new [free, of course, hat tip to the internets] software for capturing what goes on on my screen. And I am just the tiniest bit addicted to it. So here is my latest video. It's slightly boring, but if you need to make lists the whole time, it's very useful. Click <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/catalogue.txt">here</a> to get the XSL for free (rename it to .xsl - it's a text file at the moment to avoid download problems) if you want to do it yourself, or<a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com"> get in touch </a>if you want me to set it up for you (er, not for free). I'm resisting the urge to post the one where my cat is yelling in the background and I can't stop laughing. Not professional - not professional at all.
