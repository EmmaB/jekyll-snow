[to the tune of West Side Story's <em>Tonight</em>. Or is it<em> Maria</em>? That tune, anyway]

Reviews, reviews, oh how I love reviews
They make me very pleased
And relieved
Review-hoos!
Everybody likes review-ws 
Now let's hope
They turn
To sales

It trails off a bit because I can't remember the tune after that. 

Here's some of today's bag: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2uhd3o">Shiny Shiny</a> and Russell M Davies's <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3af47z">blog </a> (him wot wrote one of Rob's favourite books, Egg Bacon Chips and Beans.) Also, Restaurant magazine have reviewed Cooking with Booze but I haven't bought a copy yet.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
