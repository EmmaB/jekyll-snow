I chopped off the road because it's all sludgy. You can just about make out St Pancras if you strain your eyes! It is invisible because it is surrounded by swirling SNOW. And there's a tree in front of it. I am a terrible photographer. 

I am also in danger of getting just a little bit too excited today.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
