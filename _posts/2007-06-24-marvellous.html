As far as I'm concerned, the BBC can double their license fee and I'll happily pay up (or, more accurately, I'll ask Andy to happily pay up.) Last night's Doctor Who was marvellous...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> The script did David Tennant and John Simms proud. Gorgeous Cap'n Jack was allowed to smoulder at suitably regular intervals; Martha wasn't half bad; there was a new take on running around fast (*driving* around fast. Yes!) and where there was running there were long coats flapping in the wind and everyone looking very serious (=ubersexy). There was an excellent A-team bit where the Doctor made some magic keys for everyone, and a smashing explosion (which was even better in Confidential, over on BBC Three, where they showed how they did it). There was excellent music when the baddies took over the world. There was even a credible US president. I'm a fan of any show which gives us a vaguely human US president - much-needed escapism. The only, tiny thing I didn't like was the voices of the evil floating balls - too childish and badly acted. 

And what made it all even better - there was a huge thunderstorm cracking away over London, and just as the excellent music started when the heavens were ripped asunder and the evil baddies started to descend, the skies outside our house lit up and it started to rain in torrents. Cool! 

AND THEN, we watched the second episode of the Jekyll and Hyde programme that the BBC are running, and *that* was blummin' marvellous too. What a great evening's entertainment! And then we watched coverage of Glastonbury and were glad we weren't covered in mud. And that was our Saturday night and it was excellent. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
