What is going on here? The adult harry potter edition that was meant to arrive at our home address on Saturday arrived at work on Wednesday. I opened it today to get the returns note out, and glanced at the back cover. 

What?! Who is that horrifically ugly lady? Why, it's JK Rowling, who I've always thought looked quite good, especially after the money came in. What the bloody hell have they done to the poor woman in this photo? She looks like Victoria Wood's mother in Dinner Ladies. 

Did she sign this off? 

Shocking.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
