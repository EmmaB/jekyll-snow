The only thing worth buying in the whole world, that is. <a href="http://steampunkworkshop.com/and-post-i-digress-which-writ-guide">The Typewriter.</a> *The* Typewriter. 

Douglas Adams' typewriter is up for sale - astonishingly enough, from a vendor called NV Books who apparantly are based in Great Wolford, Warwickshire. Rob lives about 3/4 mile from there in the next village along, called Little Wolford. He could walk to pick it up - save all that costly shipping. 

It's on sale for<a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=529347759&searchurl=an%3Ddouglas%2Badams%26bi%3D0%26bx%3Doff%26ds%3D30%26fe%3Don%26sortby%3D1%26x%3D38%26y%3D7"> $25,257.94.</a> And I have that much money in our bank account. Sure, it *should* be spent on printer bills and retailer promotional invoices and, oh, whatever other fripperies a publisher spends money on. But we could ignore those bills and buy this instead. 

I think we should do it. The printers are decent chaps - they won't mind.  <br/>Emma
