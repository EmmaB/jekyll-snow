This morning I have made a square. It only takes up four of your Earth kilobytes. And yet it's not without its interest. <br/><br/><br/><br/>
Here's another one:
<img style="margin-left: 10px;" alt="skyshift.gif" src="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/skyshift.gif" width="400" height="300" />
That one's all of 20K. It's a little rickety because I've used too many colours. But what if you used an image like this as a background and it took ten minutes to get dark and then stayed that way? That would be purty*, no? The sun would set on any pages you left for too long. You'd have to reload them to get the light back. (I'm sure I didn't invent this; I just haven't seen it elsewhere before.)

(If you happen to be using a browser** that let's you right-click on a picture and choose 'View image', try it on these.)

* or maybe cheesy
**like Firefox <br/>Rob
