Whenever I see this picture in the Guardian it bothers me (see left). I don't know if Simon Jenkins has an artificial eye, but even if he does, I don't see why a publicity photo should emphasise it. And if he doesn't, then... well, need I explain. And neither do I know if he is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:SGGoauldHuman.jpg">goa'uld</a>, but now I have my suspicions. <br/><br/><br/>

I have tried to fix the picture here so you can see the difference.

It's not a great job, but at least he's giving the camera his whole attention. And his eyes aren't glowing any more. <br/>Rob
