If they insist on using this god-awful logo, the rest of the world will think that London is full of throw-back loons. If they don't respond positively to the abject horror that every single person who's commented on it has displayed and come up with a better one, I'm not going to support the Olympics. In fact, I will actively protest against it. Who's with me? Meet outside the Houses of Parliament, week on Tuesday, to lobby for aesthetics? 

We are capable of so much more. Today I am ashamed to be a Londoner. Shocking (pink).  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
