Stephen Fry writing about writing, referencing Clive James, quoting Thomas Mann saying this: <span style="font-family: courier;">"A writer is a person for whom writing is more difficult than for other people." </span> Which I sort of take to mean that a writer is both more acutely aware of words and more strict with them; it's only those who are neither who can scribble away without effort. But then again, I think writing is probably like love: different for everyone. I'm sure there are those who produce really great stuff with a casual flick of the wrist. 

The excerpt is from Stephen's recent blog post written after a prolonged bout of (screenplay?) writing. It is <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/2009/09/05/emerging-into-the-light/">here</a>.  <br/>Rob
