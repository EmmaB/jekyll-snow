Just going through some notes I made at a marketing seminar a couple of weeks ago. One note, circled a couple of times in biro, reads: "They like pain @ lit fests." At least, that's what I thought it said until I realised my awful handwriting had turned 'rs' into 'n'. Pairs. They like *pairs* of authors. Not pain. Keep telling yourself that.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
