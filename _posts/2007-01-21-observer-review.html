Today Ed Vulliamy in the Observer has a <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1995060,00.html">nice long review</a> of Mark Ames' <em>Going Postal</em>. Vulliamy has his own theories on rage massacres, which makes for an interesting comparison read. 

Only a short post today: I have to finish spring cleaning the house which is likely to trigger its own rage incident shortly. Back to the scrubbing brush...  <br/>Emma
