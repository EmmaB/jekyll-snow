If this was a scene from a sci-fi movie then mentally I'd be tutting at how ridiculous it was. Giant holes opening up suddenly in the ground and swallowing people? It sounds like something out of Doctor Who. Well, we should all be glad we don't live on the storm-sodden ground of Guatemala City. That hole (click on the thumbnail to see a bigger picture) really does look like it goes all the way down.
