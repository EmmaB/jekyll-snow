It is for people who do a search for 'outlook business contact manager greyed out'. I installed a trial of MS project yesterday. Something during the installation screwed up Business Contact Manager in Outlook 2007. To fix it, go to Tools in Outlook, and Trust Center. Select Add ins and hit Go at the bottom (COM add ins will be selected). Click on Business Contact Manager for outlook and hit OK. Then go to Help and click Activate Business contact manager. If that doesn't work, Click on Help and Disabled items. If Addin:BCMMxxx.dll is there, click it and hit enable. There, fixed. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
