Call me selfish perhaps, but I have a me-centric idea for a solution to Em's (and my) weather dilemma. Hot weather is nice, but I can't stand more than a few days of it before I want a break. Not unreasonable if you think about it. The same is true of many other things too, so why should the weather be allowed to get stuck in a monotonous rut? I mean you wouldn't want even your favourite food for <em>every</em> meal (unless it was ice cream, of course). My solution? Wobble the Earth on its axis so that instead of 365 days, a year takes a week, or maybe two. We might also have to lay the Earth over on its side a little more to accentuate the seasons, because otherwise they might not kick in quickly enough. But the upshot should be a couple of days of scorching sunshine followed by a nice, refreshing snowfall. The precessing of the Earth's axis might have to be rather abrupt because you want that snow to kick in quickly, like a cold drink after a hot afternoon, so there is some risk of shaking the Earth to pieces, but if we're not planning to fix the whole man-made climate change thing, then what have we got to lose?  <br/>Rob
