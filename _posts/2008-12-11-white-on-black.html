Gah, my eyes are swimming. I've just been trying to read <a href="http://www.peterfhamilton.co.uk/index.php?page=Judas_Unchained_Prologue">this page</a>. I now have a major headache brewing and there are swimmy white blotches in front of my eyes. Yet I'm sure I read somewhere that white on black was meant to be better for the eyes than black on white, on a screen. Do you find black on white, or white on black, or some other concoction, easiest to read?  <br/>Emma
