Very exciting! We'll find out at the awards at the BA conference in May. And huge congrats too to Arcardia, and our friends at Mr B's Emporium of Reading Delights who are both shortlisted for TWO awards: Mr B's for independent bookshop of the year and new bookshop of the year, Arcadia for the diversity award and Imprint of the Year. They must win! 

Awards! Prizes! Love 'em.
