Happy Fumes-day! Snowbooks is based in the front room of Kogan Page, in a Victorian building that used to house a company of hat-makers. Today we are revisiting our fumey heritage because some men are laying down a new carpet in the corridor next to our office. Apparantly the way to lay carpet nowadays is to glue it down good and thoroughly using a cement-mixer full of araldite. 

My throat feels full of glue, my pupils are dilating and I am beginning to see stars. Better not make any crucial business decisions this afternoon.  <br/>Emma
