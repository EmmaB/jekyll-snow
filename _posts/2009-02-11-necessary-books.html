I've heard that betting shops do perfectly well in a recession. Had it survived, I suspect Woolworths might have been nicely placed too. What about bookshops? Are books luxuries that you cut back on, as opposed to necessities like food, shelter and iPhones? Or are books cheap and simple: good value when trips out or holidays abroad might overstretch your budget? I haven't got any historic data for the recessionproofedness* of books. But some of you guys must be terribly <del>old</del> experienced and wise. Are recessions good, bad or irrelevant for bookstores and publishing companies?
