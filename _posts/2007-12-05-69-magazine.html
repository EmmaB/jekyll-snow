Hooray, Leila is top of the pops in these very swanky North and Midlands magazines. Check out the review on their <a href="http://editions.pagesuite.co.uk//PageSuite3.aspx?page=95&scale=100&height=700&width=1000&editionid=42386&filekey=&path=_PSEDitions/Dickinson/69%20Mag%20North/2007-12-03/">totally cool online reader. </a> - scroll to page 95. The review will be in the printed editions of 69 North and 69 Midlands, so if you live there look out for it. 

Thanks again to PR company extraordinaire <a href="http://www.cerubpr.co.uk">Cerub</a> for their super work.  <br/>Emma
