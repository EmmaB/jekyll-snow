I was all ready to post a slightly sarky post about a new device I bought last week, but I thought I'd try it out first to give you a rounded review. It is, ladies and gentlemen, a steam mop. I was going to talk wryly about how I was taking my dedication to steampunk a bit too far, har har, but then I switched it on. And mopped. 

And I am telling you the truth when I say that my heart skipped a beat and I realised, then, that life would never be the same. In as long as it takes to do a not very thorough hoover, my floors are steamed to a sterile gleam. Plus it sounds a bit like the Enterprise powering up. Also: steam! Great billowing clouds of the stuff. 

I heartily recommend that you acquire such a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000TVXEHG/ref=s9_k2a_gw_ir03?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=19MJ338VYCQN5533F0YA&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=467198433&pf_rd_i=468294">device</a>, as soon as you can. Life enhancing, truly. 

Steam mop!
