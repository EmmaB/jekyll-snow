Proof, were it needed, that BT are both stupid and incompetent. <img alt="bt.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/bt.jpg" width="400" height="584" />

That's a scan of two letters, both of which arrived on Saturday. The top is dated 16th Sept and is a bill. The bottom is dated 17th Sept and is a chased letter fining me for not paying the bill - which I received in the same post. 

Cue about 40 mins following their dumb call tree thing this morning. No resolution, other than a series of grunts. I am quite sure that they will apply a late payment fee to the next bill. 

I really wish they weren't in a monopoly position - I really, really do. <br/>Emma
