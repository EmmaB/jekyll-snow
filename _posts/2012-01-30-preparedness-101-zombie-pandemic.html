I mentioned in my last <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2012/01/preapocalyptic_zeitgeist.html">post</a> that the CDC (that's the Center for Disease Control in America) have issued some guidelines on how to prepare for the coming zombie apocalypse. Of course, they're sneakily telling you lots of things that would also apply if the outbreak were less supernatural in nature. But this is surely more fun. And it seems like they're continuing the pretense by offering zombie posters and now a zombie graphic novella. Posters are <a href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/pubs/phpr.aspx">here</a>. The novella is <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies_novella.htm">here</a>.  <br/>Rob
