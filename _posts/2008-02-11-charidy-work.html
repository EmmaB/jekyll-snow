I forgot to mention: I did a free cover design for Caroline Smailes' online novella, Disraeli Avenue, sales of which go towards <a href="http://www.oneinfour.org.uk/">One in Four</a>, an abuse charity. You could <a href="http://insearchofadam.blogspot.com/2008/01/disraeli-avenue.html">see it here</a> if you fancy. I don't think you can buy it yet, though - I'll let you know.  <br/>Emma
