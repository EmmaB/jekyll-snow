I quite often don't enjoy reading reviews, even if they're sunny and positive. At the risk* of making a sweeping generalisation, they tend to be badly written. But I found <a href="http://savage-midnight.livejournal.com/137129.html">this one</a> very good. 

* <em>Rob's comment:</em> I calculate that risk as being in the range "Very High to Virtual Certainty"  <br/>Emma
