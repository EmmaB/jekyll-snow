There's a lovely review of How Very Interesting in the latest issue of Laura Hird's always-excellent <em>New Review</em>:

"The latest production from the team (group? gang?) who ran the Peter Cook Appreciation Society is <em>How Very Interesting</em>. It is a collection of interviews, mostly conducted by Paul Hamilton, with people who knew Cook during his life and career. For anyone who loves his humour, or agrees with Robyn Hitchcock, quoted here, that "he and The Beatles were the biggest single modifiers of the British class system," this book is a must-have."
