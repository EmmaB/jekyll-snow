Just doing my monthly reporting and, what do you know, we've tipped over the top of 1m sales! I feel we should have a flashing icon to celebrate. Maybe Rob will add one later. 

Yes, sales of 1,002,106 since we began in 2004. And contribution to profit of 361k. (And then a bunch of overheads.) So we're not talking annual turnover or anything, I'm afraid. Good though!  <br/>Emma
