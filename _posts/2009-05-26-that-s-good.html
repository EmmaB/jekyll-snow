Yesterday, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1905005342/ref=s9_simx_gw_s0_p14_i1?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=09W873MCBFM6ZRRFXGDZ&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=467198433&pf_rd_i=468294">Going Postal </a>was at 118,000 on Amazon. Now after the documentary aired last night it's at 2,607. I don't know how many units that is yet because the report hasn't updated but I'll tell you tomorrow. 

So that's good, anyway.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
