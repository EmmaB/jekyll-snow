OK. I don't speak German, so I don't really know what that means. I just thought it might mean 'little book'. Note to self: bilingual puns are tricky if you don't speak the language. Anyway, the little book in question is the paperback edition of Naomi Klein's <em>The Shock Doctrine</em> which is now out in affordable and portable paperback. It's a love story set against the backdrop of the French Revolution, told through the eyes of one of Marie Antoinette's ladies-in-waiting. Well, not really. I just thought if I said that people would be more likely to read it. It's really about less romantic things like how the world works. People insist on democracy, so if you want to start wars or steal billions you have to do it subtly. This book is about exactly how that sort of thing happens right under our noses. And when I become Emperor, I'll put it on the school syllabus and give tests afterward to make sure everyone reads it. Here are links for the <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/WEBSITE/WWW/WEBPAGES/showbook.php?id=0141024534">Book Depository</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shock-Doctrine-Rise-Disaster-Capitalism/dp/0141024534/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1210931781&sr=8-1">Amazon</a> (just in case you're tempted).

I'm thinking of buying a ticket for the <a href="http://www.waronwant.org/Buy20tickets20to20see20Naomi20Klein+15638.twl">London launch</a> of the paperback on Monday. Anyone want to come with me?  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
