Do you have a problem with the idea of manmade climate change? Do you think tackling it is a waste of money? Whenever I've said something on this subject in the past there's always been a few people who feel that way. So do me a favour and watch this rather funny little video by comedian David Mitchell where he very strongly implies you people are morons. Which you are. For the reasons he explains.
