Down there on another post somewhere, Pierre L commented that I shouldn't elaborate on something because it sounded commercially sensitive. (He might have been being sarcastic as it was something to do with print run analyses, which is deeply dull!) But his comment has inspired me to write a note on commercial sensitivity, and how it is a bad thing.  <br/>Emma
