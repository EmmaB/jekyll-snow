From the notes to a manuscript of a new book we'll be publishing some time next year: 

<span style="font-family: courier;">"It is advisable to get clearance from your doctor if you have any doubts about your medical condition or your medication prior to training.</span>

<span style="font-family: courier;">Such clearance is even more advisable, in fact paramount, for anybody who does not intend to do any exercise."</span>

Quite right.  <br/>Emma
