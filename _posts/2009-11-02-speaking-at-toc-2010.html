I am so excited to report that we have won a slot at <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2010">TOC</a> next year. When I say 'we', I mean <a href="http://www.onixcentral.com">Onix Central</a> (the publishing software company we also run, if you didn't know). It's a 10 minute slot entitled 'Creating a catalogue in under 10 minutes'. 

To show you what I mean, here's an offer. Name a publishing company in the comments here, and as soon as I notice it (Roberrysaurus and other things permitting) I'll create and upload a pdf catalogue of that company's top 50 books published in 2009, using bibliographic data gathered from the public domain. Yes, it is magic. Yes, you can find out more if you <a href="mailto:emma.barnes@onixcentral.com">email me</a>. 

Go!  <br/>Emma
