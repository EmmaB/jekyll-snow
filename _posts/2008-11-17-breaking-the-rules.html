I mentioned a while back that Andy bought all the <a href="http://www.peterfhamilton.co.uk/">Peter F Hamilton</a> books, and after casually glancing at the first paragraph of the first book in the Night's Dawn trilogy, I ended up hooked. Thing is, the first book of the trilogy has over 1200 pages. Fine for me as a reader - it didn't feel over-long and there was little redundancy - but as a publisher I would certainly have got out my 'reject' stamp. (I don't really have a reject stamp.) 

I wonder what gems we've turned down over the years because they break the rules? One of my rules is 'if it mentioned orcs *and* elves in the first page, it's a no'. (I still think that's a good rule.) But we'll almost dismiss out of hand short story collections, anything under 70,000 words and anything over 130,000. Maybe we shouldn't. But as we say in our <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/rejection.html">open rejection letter</a>, publishers are like shoppers at a January sale - looking out for bargains, and quickly skimming over everything else. What's certain is that our opinion is formed as much by industry norms and conventions as anything - so a publisher's opinion of your book is only interesting if they decide to publish you. It's certainly no measure of the quality of your work. 

By the way, Peter F himself writes about the writing of his trilogy <a href="http://www.peterfhamilton.co.uk/index.php?page=Summary">here,</a> which is interesting.  <br/>Emma
