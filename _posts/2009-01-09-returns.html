<a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/bookselling/indie_publisher_suing_borders_for_1000000_105183.asp?c=rss">Galleycat reports</a> that a publisher in the US is suing Borders for $1m for 'excessive orders' which were then returned. Fascinating. I hate returns as you well know, but suing your customers is never going to end well. Goes to highlight both the strength of feeling and the crippling effect of returns, though.  <br/>Emma
