If I want to know a piece of information, my first thought is google. But if that doesn't work, the process goes like this:
1) google
2) ask people who might know
3) google some more
4) have a proper think about it
5) google-slog through lots of unpromising links panning for gold

I'm at 2) at the moment on a question. Is there a website or a piece of software into which you drop an electronic copy of a book and out of which (brrchzzzang!) comes flying a dozen or more of the most common e-book formats? I'm sure such a thing exists, but I haven't yet found it. Any thoughts, o stoppers-by?  <br/>Rob
