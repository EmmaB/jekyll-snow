A collection. First, a sheep. Funny, they've never been in that field before. Must be magic snow-sheep, borne in on the chilly breeze.

A traditional robin.

Some frosty rosemary.

And finally, a pair, at dusk, of chilly ears, attached to a bun digging for its dinner. I threw an organic carrot out of the window for it, in pity. Hop(e) it finds it.
