Sorry I've freaked out so many people by saying last week was traumatic - you are sweet to get in touch. Don't worry, it's not life-threatening, and I'll tell you all about it once it's resolved. But it did mean that I spent Sunday furiously knitting as I couldn't really focus on anything else. Result: another cardigan for Rowan The Forthcoming Baby:

It's done in moss stitch, and I am particularly impressed that I could fathom sufficient meaning from Debbie Bliss' incomprehensible pattern to make the collar. What would I do without YouTube and its instructional movies?  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
