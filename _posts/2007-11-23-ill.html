I have been ill most of this week. Yes, I know, I am a brave soldier for appearing so chipper on the blog, and for doing thousands of hours of work without hardly a complaint. You may gasp in awe at my amazingness. 

The reason I mention it is that I feel a bit better now. And I think I know why. I have just had my first coffee in three weeks. I am a coffee addict, I think (certainly a big fan, at least), and was drinking more than ten cups a day - until three Saturdays ago when I decided to go cold turkey. It wasn't too bad. I switched to boring old tea, and didn't feel tired or anything. But this week, I think the lack of coffee plus a bug has floored me. 

So. Back on the coffee - for health reasons. Can't say I didn't try.  <br/>Emma
