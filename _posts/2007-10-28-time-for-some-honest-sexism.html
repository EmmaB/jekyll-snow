Yes, it's probably time for me to admit to being a bit of a sexist. For instance, I'm not an unreserved fan of equal gender rights. I tend to think the world would be a better place if the current gender ratio in high places was reversed rather than equalised. Testosterone is just such volatile stuff that equal rights might be a luxury the world can't afford.

But perhaps more shocking are my views about the attraction between men and women. To my mind, the facts are these: most women spend most of their time feeling cold, especially in bed. Most men aren't much bothered by cold, especially in bed. Men like women because they are nice to have around and attractive-looking, and women like men because they need something to warm their chilly extremities on.

Yes. What I'm saying is that most women are frigid. Just not sexually. And that, I think, explains why the post I wrote about having chilly arms in bed has inspired more comments than any other - and all of them from women.  <br/>Rob
