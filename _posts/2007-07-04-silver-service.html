Hey hey, we got a medal! Sort of. It means that we are Really Quite Good at getting our bibliographic data to the right people on time. We are not Ever So Good Indeed (a Gold) because I can't help changing things from time to time as the market requires - things like the occasional publication date and so forth. Still, pretty good going. 

I like prizes.  <br/>Emma
