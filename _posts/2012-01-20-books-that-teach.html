For a while now I've been mentally preparing for a world where non-fiction books could go digital and could contain interactive, intelligent, visually responsive content. Last year I talked about the possibilities <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/07/ebooks_part_ii.html">here</a>. If Adobe were on the ball, they'd have created a platform for these things, but they seem to be letting the world of e-books pass them by. Unsurprisingly, Apple have stepped into the breach and produced a free authoring program for creating interactive textbooks. You can go <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/#video-textbooks">here</a> and see their video about the ideas behind  this new technology and what it's already capable of. Yes, the video is full of treacle and meaningful shots of multi-ethnic kids smiling, but I defy you to not get a little bit excited about the potential here. I've already downloaded a free copy of <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/">iBooks Author</a> and when I get a chance I'm going to properly explore it. And remember, this is Version 1. Apple have a strong history of building on their innovations until they really create something powerful.

Downsides: to run iBooks Author you'll need a Mac. And it'll need to be running Lion, the latest version of the OS. Other downsides: if you work in non-fiction publishing you've suddenly got a <em>lot</em> more work to do.

<strong><em>update</em></strong>: check out my follow-up <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2012/01/ibooks_caveats.html">post</a> with what I consider is some solidly bad news about the iBooks 2.0 platform.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
