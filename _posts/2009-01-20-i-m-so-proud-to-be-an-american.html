Oh. Oops. I'm not an American. But I wouldn't mind being, today. The tv doesn't come on in our house very often, so Ro's first introduction to the concept was to watch President Obama take the oath and deliver his speech. Both of us shed a tear (although I think Ro was just a bit peckish, rather than being overcome with the enormity of the event). We salute you, President Obama. Good luck to you, sir.  <br/>Emma
