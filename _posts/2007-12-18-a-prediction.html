I reckon that Clinton Cards will announce a profit warning in January. 

This year, I have received a handful of Xmas cards but an inbox full of ecards. Everyone, quite rightly, cites the environmental wastefulness of sending cards through the post and says that they are donating to charity. And quite right too. Can't be good for the Christmas card market, though. 

I wonder if the same thing will happen to books? Rob posted ages ago about the possibility that the conspicuous consumption of endangered wood pulp might not be <em>de rigeur </em>when sea levels are around our ankles. It's become acceptable, preferable even, to send an ecard. How long before printed books go the same way?  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
