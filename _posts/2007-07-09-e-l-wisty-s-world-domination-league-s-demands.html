I'm not really sure why these are posted in the Snowbooks' office, but I wander in to our HQ just infrequently enough to find them freshly amusing whenever I catch sight of them. (And because lately I am much in favour of demand no. 8.) 1. Total domination of the world by 1958.
   2. Domination of the astral spheres quite soon too.
   3. The finding of lovely ladies for Spotty Muldoon within the foreseeable future.
   4. Getting a nuclear arm to deter with.
   5. The bodily removal from this planet of C. P. Snow and Alan Freeman and their replacement with fine trees.
   6. Stopping the government from crawling up our pipes and listening to all we say.
   7. Training bees for uses against foreign powers, and so on.
   8. Elimination of spindly insects and encouragement of lovely little newts who dance about and are happy.
   9. E.L. Wisty for God. <br/>Rob
