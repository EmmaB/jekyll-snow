Amazon is big enough that it can launch entire new business models without anyone in my little village noticing and telling me. I was aware of <em>Kindle Direct Publishing</em>, but I hadn't heard about <em>Kindle Direct Publishing - Select</em>. There's an article here from a fellow called Christopher Wright discussing whether or not it's a good idea - but I actually found it most useful for first explaining what the new service actually entails. <a href="https://www.eviscerati.org/commentary/2012/02/07/everything-old-new-again-why-kdp-select-probably-isnt-good-self-published">link</a>.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
