<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/lucrezia-borgia-unmasked-in-australia-1035181.html">This interesting article </a>suggests that the only portrait in existence of Lucrezia Borgia has been discovered. Why not celebrate this discovery by buying <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9781905005826.html">The Book of Love</a>, Sarah Bower's marvellous work of historical fiction. Set against the glittering background of the court of Ferrara in the early sixteenth century, it is the heart-breaking story of what happens to an innocent abroad in the world of the Borgias. 

These two posts of mine mean you can tell that I'm sitting here reading the papers. Must do some work! 

Update: here's an image of Ceasre from Sarah to supplement her comment below.
