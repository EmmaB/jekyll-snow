<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923736/">Joss Whedon</a> created the TV shows Buffy, Angel and Firefly. Firefly was cancelled after a few weeks and has done fabulously, unbelievably well ever since on DVD. It was popular enough, despite being cancelled after half a dozen episodes, to warrant a movie sequel: the critically acclaimed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_%28film%29">Serenity</a>.

Joss Whedon has a new series in the works: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollhouse_%28TV_series%29">Dollhouse</a>. In my snarky way, I made <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/01/the_fall_and_rise_of_fox_tv.html">these predictions</a> for its roll-out. It seems l'm not the only one who thinks this way. There's already a <a href="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/05/dollhouse-fans.html">campaign to stop Dollhouse being cancelled</a>. It won't be on TV for another eight months, but fans are fed up with good shows being pulled and they intend to begin campaigning for it to be saved long before some moronic TV exec has the bright idea of terminating another piece of original and enduring television. I love that idea. It amuses and encourages me.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
