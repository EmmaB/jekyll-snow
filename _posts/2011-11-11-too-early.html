Frantically hit refresh a few times and you might see a different look to the SnowBlog. Any excuse for some snowflakes, right?

We started with an image we found on Flickr that had the appropriate <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">Creative Commons permissions</a>. And then we changed it so much that you can hardly recognise it. Here's the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/85969158@N00/3065461360/sizes/l/in/photostream/">original</a> if you're interested. Thanks <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/85969158@N00/">Mya</a> of Flickr.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
