There are two new items on this - the first is written by one <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/blogs/59478-mea-culpa.html">Mr S Pack, which makes a lot of sense, and </a> the second is a  fascinating and insightful <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/in-depth/feature/59477-the-long-bad-friday.html">feature </a>in the Bookseller. Very interesting. You'll be glad to hear that I designed the cover of their first new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/State-Me-Nasim-Marie-Jafry/dp/1906321051/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1211461931&sr=1-1">The State of Me,</a> which I've recently sent the layered artwork and fonts over for, so no doubt Harper Collins will be calling me soon to arrange to pay for it, as I've requested. Annny day now.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
