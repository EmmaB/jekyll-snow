This has got to be a Snowbooks first - a September 2007 review of a book we're publishing in March 2008! I haven't even created the online catalogue yet - must do that soon. <a href="http://mockduck.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/09/mothernight.html">Here </a> is the review. I have proof copies available, so please do <a href="mailto:mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">get in touch</a> if you are a blogger, reviewer or bookseller and I'll pop one in the post.  <br/>Emma
