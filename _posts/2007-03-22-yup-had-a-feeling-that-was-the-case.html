From today's <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,2039753,00.html">Guardian</a> re: The Great Global Warming Swindle, by director Martin Durkin. 

"Among those queueing up to attack the show was one of the scientists whose views the show purported to represent. Carl Wunsch, professor of physical oceanography at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, claimed his remarks had been distorted and that the results were "as close to pure propaganda as anything since world war two". "This seems like a deliberate attempt to exploit someone who is on the other side of the issue," he said. Wunsch is reportedly considering a complaint to the broadcasting regulator Ofcom."
