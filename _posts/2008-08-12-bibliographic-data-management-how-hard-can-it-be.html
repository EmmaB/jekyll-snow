Ah, bibliographic data. Always good to see when it works. I am, of course, being sarcastic. 

Our latest Bike book, Bicycle Design by Mike Burrows, is at #38 in the Amazon charts in: 
Books > Reference > Transport > Automotive > Trucks, Lorries & Vans 

Trucks, Lorries and Vans, eh? I sure as hell didn't put it in that category. I wonder who did? 

Still, I'm very pleased with the end result. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bicycle-Design-Perfect-Machine-Richards/dp/1905005687/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1218562802&sr=8-1">That book </a>nearly killed me, so it's good to see it looks rather fine. Smells nice, too.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
