Not content with creating fire (Fire!) I also did this.  With a lot of help from Rob. And Anna and Gilly and James. Looks like a normal (although unusually beautiful, granted) AI, you say. But did you know it was created by exporting bibliographic data from our one-version-of-the-truth ONIX database (thanks to the wonderful <a href="http://anko.ie">anko</a>), put through an xslt transform (in freeware <a href="http://www.xmlcooktop.com/">cooktop</a>) and modified with a .css style sheet? Now all the code is done I have to click just five times - compared to spending at least a morning doing it manually. Nifty. 

A few years ago, back in the days when I was a normal, ground-down, time-starved employee, I feared computers.  Now they are my friends.  <br/>Emma
