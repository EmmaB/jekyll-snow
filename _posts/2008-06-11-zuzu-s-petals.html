There's a very touching and extensive piece in today's Sheffield Star about Sue Hepworth's latest novel, Zuzu's Petals, and her inspiration for it, stemming from the death of her father six years ago. <a href="http://www.thestar.co.uk/features/A-fund-of-memories-.4173875.jp">Do have a read. </a>  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
