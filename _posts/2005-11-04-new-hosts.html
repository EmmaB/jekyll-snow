Somebody keeps forgetting to backup the blog entries.  I won't name names (because mine would be at the top of the list), but whoever keeps forgetting to make backups is responsible for our past posts going missing.  Everybody likes a fresh start, right?

We finally switched hosting companies, following recurring downtimes due to the  lackadaisical approach our old guys seemed to take regarding problem-fixin'.  The site should be back on its feet now -- possibly improved (did you notice the tweaked design?), but a few blog entries short of its former glory.  

At any rate, these are the successes I'm currently focusing on:
<ul>
<li><p>A.A. Milne's <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/milne.html">The Sunny Side</a> is featured and on promotion at Borders, Books Etc, and Waterstone's.  It might be the famous name that's pushing it along, but I like to think it's the illustration on the front cover.  Whoever did that deserves a bonus.</p></li>

<li><p>I've finished proof reading <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/plotting.html">Plotting for Beginners</a>.  I would say 'editing,' but when a manuscript's so clever that all you can change are the commas, it seems a bit cheaty to consider it anything more than proofing.  Hooray for books that are being published by Snowbooks.</p></li>

<li><p>On a semi-personal-life note, I won an Adana Letter Press on eBay, along with a huge lot of accessories.  I'd love to give our proofs (which are printed and bound here in our office, by our very hands) custom printed covers on coloured card.  It seems novel and a bit 'let's hear it for antiquated technology!' at the moment, but I'm sure to go overboard and fill the office with letterpressed goods.  I need to find an old tray of wingbats with a snowflake.  Then we'll be made.</p></li>
