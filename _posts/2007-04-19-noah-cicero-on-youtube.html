Phew... as Emma's been telling you, quite a three days. Before I give my personal round-up - and tell you about some other Snowbooks-related stuff from last week which didn't make it in before the fair - here's something fun from one of our authors.

Noah Cicero, whose stunning debut <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Human-War-Noah-Cicero/dp/1905005466/ref=sr_1_1/202-1995931-5877447?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1176977711&sr=8-1"><em>The Human War</em></a> is out on the 7th of June and will blow your socks off, gave a reading at the KGB Bar in New York last week. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Co26FkWiTI">A video of the event is up on YouTube</a>, and I've embedded it above.

The sound's not great, but it certainly gives a strong impression of the intensity and feeling of Noah's work. He is truly unlike anyone else you will have seen and read - for the good.  <br/>
