Joel Rickett <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2280559,00.html">mentions</a> Rob's <a href="http://www.bookbackers.co.uk">Bookbackers </a>idea - one that is 'promising', in his view - in the Guardian Review today, as well as a round up of the Nibbies, in which we're not mentioned but hey ho. Just thought I'd let you know.  <br/>Emma
