**UPDATED** She's found, locked in a neighbour's house when they're on holiday! Hooray! Phew, what a relief! Thanks for your kind comments.

Can you help out one of Snowbooks' authors and keep a look out for this gorgeous cat:

She's been missing from <a href="http://tinyurl.com/qv07">this street </a>since Sunday and really needs to be found now. Note the excellently distinctive nose. <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">Email me</a> or phone me over the weekend (number is <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/booktrade.html">here and starts with 0790)</a> if you see her, and I'll put you in touch with the author. 

Thanks, ever so. Having a cat go missing is one of the worst feelings in the world. Let's hope she gets found.  <br/>Emma
