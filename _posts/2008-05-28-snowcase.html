...er, I can't remember which number we're at. Let's say 50. <span style="font-family: courier; color: darkblue;">[<em>Rob's comment</em>: 43, Em. It's 43.]</span>

//update, 14th Jul 08 - the author has request that Low Tide, Lunan Bay be removed from the SnowCase as it's now being published and she's worried that her publishers might object. Sorry about that. For reference, all SnowCase submissions are lsited on the assumption that they're displayed permanently.//  <br/>Emma
