<p>I don't want to steal the whole thing, because it's too coarse for you refined types (or me, actually. I'm very delicate) but I liked this unpleasantly macabre headline from The Daily Mash. </p>

<blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;">SURVIVORS TO ENJOY GLORIOUS SUMMER, SAYS MET OFFICE</span></p></blockquote>
<span style="font-family: courier;"><blockquote><p>BRITAIN'S small band of pork flu survivors can look forward to a hot, dry summer, the Met Office confirmed last night.</p></blockquote></span> <span style="font-family: courier;"><blockquote><p>After the densely populated wash-outs of the last two years, experts said Britain's thinned-out herd will enjoy the 'perfect combination' of great weather and very short queues.</p>

<p>A Met Office spokeswoman said: "The roads will be nice and quiet and the beaches will be wonderfully empty. </p></blockquote></span>
