Ooh, lovely! The Affinity Bridge is BBC radio Birmingham's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2008/06/10/les_ross_book_club_feature.shtml">book of the month</a> for November. They'll be discussing it at 2pm on BBC WM on Wednesday 26th November, so we'll be tuning in then!  <br/>Emma
