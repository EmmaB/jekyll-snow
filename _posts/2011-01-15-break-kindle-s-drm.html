I'm just noticing this now, despite the fact it's dated 01/01/2010, because I only just saw a link on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5733075/how-to-remove-drm-from-your-kindle-ebooks?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+lifehacker%2Ffull+%28Lifehacker%29">lifehacker</a> about it. But here's a <a href="http://www.toosmartguys.com/kindle-unswindle">semi-complex method</a> for stripping the copy protection and access-control from Kindle books. I'm guessing that very few people could be bothered with something that's still reasonably involved. But if someone packaged up the software nicely and made it a one-click operation then maybe it would catch on. What do you'all think? Is this going to be like the downloading crazes of the early Noughties? Or are the book-reading public a bit too civilised for mass piracy?  <br/>Rob
