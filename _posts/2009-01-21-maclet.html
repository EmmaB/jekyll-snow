I don't seem to have much time to write for this here blog at the moment. I seem to be leaving it all up to Em. Who has a business to run and a small baby to amuse. It's not fair really. I'm very busy, but not with anything anyone would want to read about. But I did make something the other day that some of you might like. I've been having trouble with the <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/05/most_shiny.html">little netbook</a> I bought a while back. It keeps crashing. So I thought I'd get a replacement. But I wanted a Mac. Only they don't (yet) make a Mac netbook. So I made my own (with lots of help from the internets). Continue reading to see a couple of pictures. It's based on something called a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/detail/detail.do?group=computersperipherals&type=mobilecomputing&subtype=netbook&model_cd=NP-NC10-KA02US">Samsung NC10</a>, which is a popular little Windows (or Linux) netbook. But using my amazing <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/10/promethean_fire_or_near_equiva.html">label remover</a>, I got rid of the Samsung logo on the lid and replaced it with a cheap Apple sticker. And of course I loaded it up with the Mac operating system.

It's not perfect. There are a couple of things that don't work properly because it's not a proper Mac. But it's great to use. It goes to sleep in under two seconds (like a Mac) and starts up again just as quickly. And thanks to the NC10's design, it's good for about five hours of use without recharging.
