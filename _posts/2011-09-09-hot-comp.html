I urge you to hot-tail it to <a href="http://midnightreaping.com/Wayne-Simmons-Competition.html">midnightreaping.com</a> where you will find a corking competition to win Wayne Simmons books. All you have to do is like (Facebook) and follow (Twitter) the competitionereer and you might be picked at random. Go!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
