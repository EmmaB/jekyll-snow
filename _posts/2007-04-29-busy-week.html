So the working week starts in a few minutes for Gilly and I when I get off the sofa and leave the house to get the train to Harrogate for the BA conference. I'm really looking forward to it - I went for the first time last year, thinking it would be the usual bland fare, but the seminars and speakers were, for the most part, outstanding and I had a blast. Oh, and we won small publisher of the year, which is bound to put a person in a good mood. 

So Harrogate it is, Sunday to Wednesday morning. Then back to London on the 8.15, to catch the train straight to Norwich for Sarah's lauch of Needle in the Blood. Then back after midnight, to a busy day of important meetings on Thursday with esteemed customers. Then the Society of Bookmen dinner in the evening. 

I will next sit on this sofa on Friday night. Phew!  <br/>Emma
