I assume it's because I live in the country, but my letters don't usually get put through my front door. They get put in a post box built into the garden wall nearest the road. Yesterday when I checked my post there was a big dead bee in there. Who would have posted me a bee? It remains a mystery.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
