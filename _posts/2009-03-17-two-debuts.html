My ace pal Jenn Ashworth, a debut novelist herself, has just interviewed Snowbooks' debut novelist Fiona Robyn. Whisk yourself <a href="http://jennashworth.blogspot.com/2009/03/change-is-as-good-as-rest.html">thither </a>to read the interview and <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Robyn.html">thence </a>if you're tempted to buy something of Fiona's with which to blow your mind.

And while I'm on the subject, you should check out Jenn's novel too - A Kind of Intimacy - published by Arcadia (Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kind-Intimacy-Jenn-Ashworth/dp/1906413061/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1237288977&sr=8-1">link</a>). It's so unsettling that you want to keep reading but you also want to cover your eyes. There's a great interview with Jenn <a href="http://dogmatika.wordpress.com/2009/03/13/every-day-she-lies-a-little-an-interview-with-jenn-ashworth/">here</a>, which should help you figure out whether her particular species of unreliable narrator is one you'd dare to share some headspace with.  <br/>Rob
