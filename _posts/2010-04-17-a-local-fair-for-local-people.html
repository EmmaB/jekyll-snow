I haven't been thinking much about the London Book Fair, even though it's next week, because my role tends to be less to do with moving and/or shaking and more in the line of holding people's coats. But it has been drawn to my attention that with no flights entering British airspace recently there might be a marked shortage of foreign visitors to the fair. Presumably it will be a strangely quiet, strange provincial LBF. I think we'll still be able to do all the things we planned to, but what about you? Is this a disaster?  <br/>Rob
