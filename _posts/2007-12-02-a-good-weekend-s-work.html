Well, I say work. I did try to have some time away from a computer last weekend, but it made me nervous and fidgety. So, like the coffee, this weekend I've been back at my laptop, and loving it. I have done three tremendous things. Firstly, I read Rob's superb new book. I am very excited about it, and more on that in the near future. 

Secondly, I wrote a website. It's an important website, and I wanted to get it right - but I had a lot of fun with it because Wordpress Is So Bloody Super. I'll tell you more next week. 

Thirdly, I cracked a thing in XSLT that I've been foiled by for the last forever. I won't bore you with the details, but I've figured out how to get selected bibliographic data for selected titles to import into Indesign in one fell swoop - crucial for catalogues. Previously, I could only figure out how to do it one title at a time, which is laborious. Not any more! Works like a charm, mainly thanks to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beginning-XSLT-2-0-Novice-Professional/dp/1590593243/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1196626246&sr=8-2">Jeni Tennison's superb book</a>.

So whilst the things I've done are related to work, they're not really anything to do with the gazillion things I have on my to-do list. And because I am very pleased with myself for learning lots and finishing two big projects, I have this sense of having had a rest. Weird, I know. But I bet I'm not alone in having to be doing *something* otherwise I go twitchy - am I? <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
