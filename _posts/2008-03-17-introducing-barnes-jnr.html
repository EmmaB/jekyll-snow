Needn't have worried - this one will be a black belt by 15. S/he was punching and kicking like a pro, with a strong heartbeat (like I know what I'm talking about - it was beating, put it that way) and 10 fingers and toes (you could see them!) 5 cm and due 2nd October - the day before my birthday. And personally, I think that's one pretty baby (no bias there!) 

Phew, glad that was all positive! !  <br/>Emma
