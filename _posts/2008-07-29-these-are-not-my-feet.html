To the casual observer - me - it looks like I have recently, and badly, sprained both my ankles. Click below to see the damage (below the cut to avoid exposing innocent browsers to graphic medical images).  

I say again - Summer, please go away now. Autumn and Winter, form an orderly queue. <img alt="foot.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/foot.jpg" width="400" />

For the record, my ankles are normally half the size. I think. I hope. Oh god, I hope it's just swelling from Summer heat, not actual foot fat from all the Magnums. Ew! Foot fat! Gross. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
