Now I know this is dull compared to the glamour of awards and what have you, but it's important nevertheless. Thanks in good part to our friends at <a href="http://www.anko.ie">Anko</a>, Snowbooks is now fully ISBN13 compliant. If you care about that sort of thing, you'll know that's good. If you don't, you would care even less if I explained to you what it meant. This standard is in addition to our ONIX compliance status which we achieved, ooh, ages ago. If you want to know any more, <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">shout.</a> 

Yes, we win prizes for our lovely books but our dull-yet-important efficiency is also something to be proud of.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
