Here's a lovely photo of Sarah Bower and pals celebrating the publication of The Book Of Love. That's the shy author there, behind the hardback of her new historical novel. 

Tell you what, selling hardbacks is good if you can do it. We sold over 200 copies of BOL's hardback on the week it was published, primarily to libraries - it's a 19.99 book at a 55% discount. Very nice.  <br/>Emma
