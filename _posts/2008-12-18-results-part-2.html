The lovely Bookseller has <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/news/73174-snowbooks-returns-a-profit.html">done a piece</a> on our results. As I mentioned yesterday, the only reason our profits were so comically low in the previous year (-84k) was because we put through a large reserve against returns of 138k. Take one from the other and you're left with a better idea of what our actual performance was that year.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
