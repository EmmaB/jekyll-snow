Hey hey! It's October, so it must be Christmas! And with Christmas comes peace, love and presents. 

This week's present? Review copies of our Christmas books!  Yes sirree, if you maintain a blog, or magazine, or habitually scrawl your views on life in chalk on the pavement, you are entitled to whichever Snowbooks you like. You're not obliged to like them (although you will) and you're not obliged to talk about them (although, come on, you should) - just <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">email me</a> with your choice (and you're welcome to have more than one!) and I'll pop it in the post. 

The Christmas range can be seen in the lovely SnowGlobe on snowbooks.com's <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com">homepage.</a>  <br/>Emma
