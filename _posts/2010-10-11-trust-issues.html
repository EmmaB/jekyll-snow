"Surreal" is a word I've been using a lot lately. Well, you've read my <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/10/announcement.html">previous post</a> so you can imagine what I'm talking about. Fake personal history, fake daughters, fake marriages, non-existent cars, non-existent houses, non-existent court cases. When it comes to unscrambling our business dealings from Robin Tobin's influence there's a lot of work to do - with frequent breaks for us to just sit and boggle at the scope and logistical complexity of the deceptions we allowed ourselves to become ensnared in. It's a muddle and a mess and an embarrassment but we can, to a point, sort of shrug and get to work digging ourselves out. What I can't accept or even begin to get comfortable with are the stories I hear from the women who have been involved with Robin. If you are one of those women or you know one, maybe you would keep reading because Em and I have the beginnings of a plan for how we could make a start on repairing some of the damage. What I didn't mention in my last post, when I was talking about the women Robin has tricked, manipulated and two-timed, is that Emma was one of them. She was going through a divorce and Robin became the perfect, supportive, understanding suitor. If it weren't for the fact he was still involved with two other women (that we know of) you could really believe he was a lovely guy.

You might wonder how anyone could juggle such a tangled personal life and not be discovered sooner. I think I've worked out at least some of the answers. For a start, compartmentalisation played a big role. As I understand it, girlfriends are normally forbidden from contacting Robin's work colleagues, friends or family. If there's any danger of one woman learning about the existence of another they'll be primed to expect an unstable stalker, who is not to be approached or trusted, who won't accept the relationship is long over.

His fictitious children play a central role in allowing Robin to disappear when he needs to - which happens frequently given the number of plates he needs to keep spinning. Goodness knows how many times a fall in the playground or a fever enabled Robin to duck out for two or three days. It came not just as a shock but as a kind of relief to learn that these poor, accident-prone and permanently traumatised children didn't exist.

Another important part of how the web is spun is down to pure, thinking-on-your-feet, deceptive showmanship. I've seen Robin's stories evolve on-the-fly with such smooth transitions that you hardly notice the ground shifting beneath your feet. Details are 'clarified' in such a way that you really feel a fool for getting the wrong end of the stick. And he is able to look hurt and wronged and innocent with total conviction. I'm not one of those who've seen him cry on cue, but I don't doubt the claims of those who say they have.

And finally, many of those who are in a position to warn others are afraid. They've been threatened and they believe Robin has powerful friends (his shady Russian business contacts, his tame pitbull-style barrister 'Darren' who'll sue you for harassment, and many other allies, all non-existent from what I can tell). A number of these women have young children and want to protect them from any unpleasantness. And they live in fear of the visit from the Social Services that Robin assures them they'll receive if they contact anyone they shouldn't.

What I'm getting at here is that I understand at least part of how Robin is able to form such a strong and rapid bond with the women he involves himself with and how he is, for a while, able to convince them that they are the very centre of his world. What I probably haven't managed to convey, or even to understand myself, is the sense of loss he leaves behind. It's no understatement to say that many of these women are devastated when they learn the truth. Part of it is learning how thoroughly they have been deceived, but an even larger part of it seems to be that they honestly believed they had met their true soulmate, the love of their life. Some, apparently, are so smitten they want him back even when they know about how he's treated their many predecessors, presumably because they believe themselves to be the exception: the one he's finally going to settle down with.

So, where I see a scruffy, middle-aged man with a likable manner, the women he targets see a person they're eager to spend the rest of their life with. And it takes a lot of work and a lot of persuasion to get them to give up that dream. Fortunately the truth is a bucket of cold water, and in Em's case it didn't take too long for her to realise how completely she'd been manipulated. That said, it still required long conversations with some of Robin's previous victims and with his enormously long-suffering and exhausted father, for whom I have terrific sympathy.

To that end, it seems like an increasingly important idea that Em and I find a way to get Robin's victims in contact with one another. Many of them feel terribly foolish for being taken in when, in many cases, their friends and family could see that something was seriously amiss. In some cases this has driven a wedge between them and the support network they would normally rely on. That isolation is compounded because no one else understands what they've been through.  But I've also seen how, by talking to each other, they can start to feel stronger.

And of course before the need for support comes the need to recognise the truth. What you might call 'breaking the spell' - and it's not easy. A concerned friend or two are not going to talk most women out of what they believe is true love. But a dozen former victims who can quote you the lines he'll have used and the stories he'll have told might well get through.

And finally, what allows Robin to find new victims is the anxious silence of his former victims (coupled with the legitimising effect that his association with companies like Snowbooks or Onix Central can have - but we're fixing that right now). I can't help but think more women would be prepared to take a stand or go public with their experiences if they knew they had the support and the encouragement of others who had been through the same thing.

To that end, we've set up an e-mail address: <a href="mailto:After.RT@gmail.com">After.RT@gmail.com</a> for people to get in touch with Em and me and those victims of Robin's we're already in contact with. We have an idea or two for how victims, or their friends and family, can share their experiences and support each other, and that e-mail address will be the first point of contact for creating that support network. 

Em told me that she now knows that Robin joined an online dating site the same evening he moved in with her and is currently active on several more. Couple that with the fact he was still seeing two other women when he got involved with Emma and this starts to look like a production-line approach to conning women. So drop us a line at <a href="mailto:After.RT@gmail.com">After.RT@gmail.com</a> whatever stage of that process you're currently at or if you're one of those watching it happen to someone else and wanting to find some allies.

(There's a follow-up post to this one, with another set of revelations, <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2010/11/a_tale_of_accidental_piracy.html">here</a>.)

<strong>NB</strong>: following an e-mail on the subject, I should point out that this isn't our roundabout way of announcing that we're going bust. Robin wasn't involved in the running of Snowbooks and didn't get his paws into our coffers (such as they are). We're only using the SnowBlog because it's the best way we have of reaching people. Snowbooks is fine. <br/>Rob
