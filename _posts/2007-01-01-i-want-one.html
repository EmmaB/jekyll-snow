From this week's Observer:

<a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,1980675,00.html">2.5m digital books on one &pound;25,000 machine</a>

"A machine that electronically stores 2.5 million books that can then be printed and bound in less than seven minutes is to be launched early next year. It prints in any language and has an upper limit of 550 pages. The 'Espresso' will be launched first in several US libraries. The company behind the project - On Demand Books - predicts that, within five years, it will be able to reproduce every book ever published."

I know it <em>is</em> a lot, but &pound;25,000 isn't<em> that</em> much if you are a biggish business.  I wonder what will happen with this?  <br/>Emma
