As you know, Rob's main job as Chairman of Snowbooks is to put the pictures up on all the blog posts - including mine, because I'm too <strike>lazy</strike> busy to do it myself. 

So this post is purely here as a way for me to tell when Rob's back at his desk so I can phone him, cos I want to talk to him about a presentation I have to do in a couple of weeks. When the picture pops up next to this blog post, I know he's there. 

Smart thinking from Barnes, I think you'll agree.
