Am just trying out the BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/">iPlayer</a> service. I'm about halfway through the two-part drama broadcast on BBC Two last week: <em>Burn Up</em>. It's about man-made climate change and the grubby power politics that slow our response to the problem. It's neatly written and capably acted, with a very solid cast. Despite unhurried pacing, it's good meaty stuff with occasional high points that hold the attention (well, mine at any rate). It's the sort of drama I wish there were a lot more of (even if we set aside its worthy intentions). What's extremely depressing is the audience viewing figures for the second instalment:
<em>Celebrity MasterChef</em>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.89m viewers
<em>A Touch of Frost</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3m viewers
<em>Big Brother </em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.65m viewers
<em>Burn Up Part II </em> &nbsp;&nbsp;1.56m (down from 2.4m for Part I)  <br/>Rob
