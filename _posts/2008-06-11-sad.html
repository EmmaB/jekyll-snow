For reasons that aren't easy to explain but involve the idea that one day I'd quite like to have a 4 colour printing press in my back garden, complete with a man in blue overalls to operate it, I subscribe to a newsfeed about printing presses, and their sale, auction and exchange. And this rather sad thing came into my in box today: the auction of Butler and Tanner's machines (click below to see the details). A sad day. <img alt="sale.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/sale.jpg" width="400" height="605" /> <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
