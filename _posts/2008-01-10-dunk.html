For reasons I can't precisely recall, on Tuesday I decided to drop my phone into a river. It lay at the bottom for about a minute, its screen blazing white as all its little pixels lit up. Then, for various other reasons having to do with balance and slipperiness, I lay on the bottom of the river for rather less than a minute. But what's more than a little surprising to me is that two days later I'm using the phone without any problems. Yes, there's still some water under the touch-sensitive screen. And immersing it caused it to forget the date and time - but apart from that it's just the same as before (only slightly cleaner). If you don't believe me, try it for yourself.*
