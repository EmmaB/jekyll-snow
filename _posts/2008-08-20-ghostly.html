I don't print much (aside from thousands and thousands of books, but I mean in the office), and my printer's been out of ink for a couple of days. I've just got round to topping it up, and it turns out there was a document waiting to print. Here it is.

My guess is that Rob has found out that the printer is installed on the server, not locally, so he can fire it up from anywhere else in the world. And yes, I did look round. Just in case...  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
