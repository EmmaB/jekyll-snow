So I've just called the courier to come and deliver our submission for the 2007 Small Publisher of the Year award. I am very chuffed with our effort for this years' award. We did it, appropriately enough, in the form of a book. Here is a little photo gallery. <img alt="sub1.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/sub1.jpg" width="300" height="201" />

We hand-printed and hand-bound the books ourselves using our nipping press, guillotine and fancy new printer that spits out pages faster than you can say 'blimey, look how fast the new printer's spitting out pages'. It's a paperback, bound with card with a paper jacket wrapped around.

Spiny goodness

A plate section, printed on our colour printer and bound into the text pages. The actual submission is on the first 15 pages; the rest is sample first chapters and some interesting bits and bobs about us.

Fingers crossed! <br/>Emma
