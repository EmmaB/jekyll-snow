Em was at the IPG/IPA awards last night in Brighton and she just called and asked me to pass on some important news, only I can't remember what it was.  I remember she said that her husband, Andy, looked lovely in his new DJ last night.  And I know she said they had a lovely walk along the beach this morning. And I recall her saying that everyone was really nice and friendly. 

I know there was one other thing. It's on the tip of my tongue. Anyway, if I remember what it was, I'll update this post. Hope everyone's having a good weekend.  <br/>Rob
