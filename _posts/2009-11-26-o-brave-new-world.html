That has such high-tech dealie-bobs in't! 

I know it's stupid, but that watch in the picture links to your cell phone via bluetooth. When the phone in your pocket/bag rings, the watch vibrates and the watch's display shows who's calling. I won't buy it for myself for Christmas, but I could. I mention that because if you'd offered me such a thing when I was, say, eleven, I think my head would probably have exploded. When I was a child, only the Men from Uncle could own something like that. Now every stupid nerd with too much money <a href="http://www.expansys.com/d.aspx?i=190072">can have one</a>. Pleasurable sigh.  <br/>Rob
