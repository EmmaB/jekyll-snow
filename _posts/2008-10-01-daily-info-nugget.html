Today's nugget comes from Cory Doctorow's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Content-Selected-Technology-Creativity-Copyright/dp/1892391813/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222851572&sr=8-2">Content</a>, which I mentioned <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/10/giving_it_away_1.html">earlier</a>. Instead of paraphrasing, I'm excerpting (because I have an electronic copy which makes it easy).
<span style="font-family: courier; color: #330000;">"David Blackburn, a Harvard PhD candidate in economics, published a paper in 2004 in which he calculated that, for music, "piracy" results in a net increase in sales for all titles in the 75th percentile and lower; negligible change in sales for the "middle class" of titles between the 75th percentile and the 97th percentile; and a small drag on the "super-rich" in the 97th percentile and higher. Publisher Tim O'Reilly describes this as "piracy's progressive taxation," apportioning a small wealth-redistribution to the vast majority of works, no net change to the middle, and a small cost on the richest few."</span> Interesting, no? A PDF of the paper is <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/blackburn_fs.pdf">here</a> in case you want to read it.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
