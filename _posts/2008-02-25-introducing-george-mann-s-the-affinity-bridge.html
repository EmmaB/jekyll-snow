Hot off the press, a fabulous Steampunk tale and our big title of Christmas 2008, featuring Crown investigator Sir Newbury and his astonishingly proficient assistant Miss Hobbes, signed up last week, out October of this year, cover done in one mammoth sitting on Saturday. What do you think? Hint: isn't it just about the most gorgeous thing you've ever seen?
