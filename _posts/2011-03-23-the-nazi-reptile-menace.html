So, what if the Nazis had had a bunch of murderous dinosaurs on their side? Worrying, huh? I really like these fake WWII propaganda posters based on just such a scenario. Apparently they're for (now where are my spectacles) something called a 'computer video game', whatever one of those is. Details <a href="http://www.dinodday.com/">here</a> if you're interested. Or just check out the posters on <a href="http://m.io9.com/5783379/propaganda-posters-urge-you-to-keep-calm-and-shoot-nazi-dinosaurs">io9</a>.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
