I love <a href="http://makezine.com/magazine/">MAKE magazine</a>. It's filled with all the things I desperately wanted to do as a child and was never allowed. (Or in a few instances, things I did anyway and got into trouble for.) It's about how to take things apart and turn them into things that suit you better. How to modify, customise or make from scrap. And reading MAKE led me to <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">Instructables</a>, which is full of step by step instructions submitted by the general geeky public for performing all sorts of major and minor feats of hackery and re-purposing, but it also includes tips on crafts and pets and kids and lots more. I couldn't resist linking to one of the least useful and most surreal of their technical projects: How to <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Compubeaver---%3e-How-to-case-mod-a-beaver---in-29-e/">assemble a computer inside a stuffed beaver</a>.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
