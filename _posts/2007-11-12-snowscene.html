Winter is finally here! Well, it is in Aberdeen. Here's a lovely scene from commenter Judith's walk this morning, featuring Minnie the dog. A proper Snowdog name, since Anna's dog is also called Minnie. I note that neither of them are, in fact, particularly mini, so that makes it even more interesting.

Thanks, Judith!  <br/>Emma
