Unbelievable. After discovering Microsoft Office Accounting, which I have extolled the virtues of previously, I am distressed to report that they are killing it off (with a fortnight's notice). Bloody typical. I blame you, internet, for not buying enough copies of it to make it worth poor little Microsoft's effort. For shame [tuts, shakes head slowly].

How likely is it that I will ever find another reliable, intuitive, cheap, robust accounting solution? Not likely. Not likely at all.  

Boo.  <br/>Emma
