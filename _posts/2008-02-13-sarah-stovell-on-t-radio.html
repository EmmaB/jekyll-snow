Once Rob's finished writing about Daleks, I'll get him to make this easier, him being Snowbooks' sound man and me dealing more with, well, whatever it is I deal with. (<em>Rob's update</em>: I've made it a <em>bit </em>easier). But if you go <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/networks/oxford/aod.shtml?oxford/jo_thoenes#">here </a>, then click the 15min fast forward button till you get to 1.15, then the 5 min fast forward button until you get to about 1.20, then you'll hear a piece on first editions which Sarah masterfully turns round to talking about <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/author_Stovell.html">Mothernight</a>. 

Phew. 

<em>Rob's update</em>: Just running out the door, so don't have time to check, but if this is a show that goes out daily, the Listen Again feature may already point to a different program.  Sorry about this. I should have grabbed a copy and posted it (illegally) on the SnowBlog. I just didn't realise it would disappear so quickly.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
