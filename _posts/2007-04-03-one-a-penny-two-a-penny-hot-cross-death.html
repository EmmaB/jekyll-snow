Looks so innocent, doesn't it? All hot, and crossed, and with delicious, plump raisins. But beware, friends! This is the hot cross bun of death! 

Yesterday I was Off Work with food poisoning, brought on by a hot cross bun, or two. Or four. I think they were the culprits, anyway. So I laid on my bed, feeling very grotty, hallucinating about various things (it was quite a bad dose of food poisoning) including vaguely thinking that I was lying in the aisle of a Hobbycraft and that I should really get out of the way because someone might run me over in a shopping cart full of felt. Thankfully today I feel much better, aided significantly by the best piece of grilled tuna I have ever had in my life from Pescatori. 

So, in summary, do not eat four dodgy hot crossed buns.  <br/>Emma
