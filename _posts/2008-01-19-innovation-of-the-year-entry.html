A couple of people have asked what our entry was for the IPA innovation of the year prize that we're shortlisted for. I can't see the harm in sharing the entry with you. It's a bit self-congratulatory, as these things tend to be, so forgive me for being all ooh, aren't we great, but hopefully it's interesting. Er, if you like XSL.
