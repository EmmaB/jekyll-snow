Ooh, I do like it here. It's like being at the sea side - the air is all fresh and there are doughnuts. My speech went well, I think, and <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/blogs/113649-they-do-things-differently-there.html">here's my write up of the event in The Bookseller</a>. Ro is being an utter delight and a charmer and New York has fallen at his feet. Hardened taxi drivers play peep bo with him. Huge doormen tickle his toes. Surly diner staff bring him tiny plates of strawberries on the house. I think we'll come back here.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
