Reproduced in all its finery for you, below. Hello my dear,

I am Miss ROSEMARY Davidson, single. Please, I want you to open this E-Mail attachment file as required of you, go through the business transaction message very carefully and, get back to me for more details.

I know that, you may think that it is a VIRUS that I sent to you. NO, it is not a VIRUS. It was because of the Confidentiality and safety of this business I sent to you, made me to send the message to you through E-mail Attachment. 

So please, I would like that you open the attachment, read and get back to me for to discuss on how we are going to execute the business for the mutual benefit of us.

I wait your urgent response as soon as you read this message.

Thanks for your understandings.

Yours lovely one.

Rosemary. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
