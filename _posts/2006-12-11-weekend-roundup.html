We had lots of mentions over the weekend so I thought I'd pull them together here, as an excellent displacement activity before I start on my to do list. 

First up, an <a href="http://www.slnn.com/index.php/article/about/article17.html">interview</a> with PK Rimbauld aka James on our new store in Second Life. 

<a href="http://www.slnn.com/index.php/article/about/article17.html"><img alt="sb copy.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/sb%20copy.jpg" width="400" height="305" /></a>

Next, a very kind mention on <a href="http://www.thefridayproject.co.uk/pack/">Scott's blog</a> about our design services who says we are "creative, clever, commercial and full of good ideas." Eee! And in the same place, <a href="http://www.dovegreyreader.typepad.com/">DoveGreyReader</a> mentions our most brilliant of novels <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Miniature-Man-R-Muir/dp/0954575946/sr=8-6/qid=1165826903/ref=sr_1_6/202-6320707-3901400?ie=UTF8&s=books">The Miniature Man</a>. I tell you, that book is one of the best in the world and I want people to read it - so I offered three for free. Two have been claimed so one is still up for grabs - <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">email </a>if you'd like a copy. 

And that's about it. On with the to do list, then...  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
