And to complete the below, many congratulations to Adeline, Steve and Dean in London, Gwyn in Somerset, and Eva in Pennsylvania, USA, who won copies of Lisa Carver's <em>Drugs Are Nice</em> in the Londonist competition. Your books are on their way.

Thanks to the good people at <a href="http://www.Londonist.com">Londonist</a> - if you live in London, check them out. They rule.  <br/>
