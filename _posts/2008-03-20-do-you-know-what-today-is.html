It's Cure concert day! It's at Wembley Arena. It's at 8pm. It's the first Cure concert that I'll have worn blue jeans to because nothing else fits any more. It's my eighth Cure concert: 

1) 1992 Wish Tour Nottingham Rock City (capacity 900!) 
2) 1996 NEC, Birmingham
3) 1996 Earl's Court
4) 2000 Wembley
5) 2002 Hyde Park
6) (I'm sure I went to Wembley in 2004 but I can't find the stub)
7) 2006 Albert Hall

And I am Very Excited. 

(Oh, plus babies don't have ears until week 17 so there goes my plan to influence its tastes in music in the womb.) <br/>Emma
