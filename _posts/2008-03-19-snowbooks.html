For that is our company's name. Not Snow Books. Not SnowBooks. Not Snow. Not Snow Publishing. Not Snow Press. And my name is Emma Barnes, not Mrs Snow (although it would be cool if it was). 

It sounds daft to say it but people get it wrong so often that I thought I'd make it crystal clear. And <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/snowbooks.avi">here is how</a> you pronounce it. Here is how you <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/sb.avi">do NOT</a> pronounce it. 

Apart from making me bemused, because I thought it was quite straightforward, misspelling makes it hard to track our press and blog coverage. 'Snowbooks' is a good, unique term to search for. 'Snow Books' brings up all sorts of stuff about people in cold climes having to stay indoors to read because it's too cold outside - less relevant to the smooth running of our business.  <br/>Emma
