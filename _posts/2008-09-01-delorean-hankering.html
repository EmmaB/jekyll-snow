I will of course admit I don't need one. They're probably not even practical. Or reliable. Though I'm not too bad with a spanner and a... whatever those other dealiebobs are called. It's just that someone is selling <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Delorean-1982-LHD-De-Lorean_W0QQitemZ300252635189QQcmdZViewItem?hash=item300252635189&_trkparms=39%3A1|66%3A2|65%3A7|240%3A1318&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14">one on eBay</a>. If only it was 18 instead of 18,000. You can convert them to run on garbage, you know.  <br/>Rob
