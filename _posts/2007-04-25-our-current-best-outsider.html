In Saturday's <em>Guardian</em>, Nicholas Lezard wrote a long piece on 'the counterculture', citing such authors as William S. Burroughs, C&eacute;line, J. G. Ballard, and the Marquis de Sade in his argument that "Today's counterculture becomes tomorrow's culture: you have to snap it up quickly."

But who should Lezard pick as the prime example of a contemporary author destined to follow in such footsteps?

"Our current best outsider is Stewart Home, who puts a spoke in the wheels of success not only with his scorn for the conventional niceties of plot and character but also by giving his novels titles like <em>Cunt</em>. Stewart Home is easily the example you reach for first as a contemporary "alternative" writer - but he is so observant, so dedicated to his work, so usefully enraged by mainstream ethical considerations, and personally gentlemanly to boot, that he, too, willy-nilly, will end up becoming respectable one day."

Stewart will be reading tonight in South London, and it would be great to see some Snowbooks fans there. Here are the details:
