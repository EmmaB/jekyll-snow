to do all my boring year end tax stuff this morning - P35s and P14s - but it turns out my fabulous bookkeeper has done them, last week, online, without me even knowing. That's the kind of accounting I like. To celebrate, I've had a cheese sandwich and read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/may/06/consumeraffairs.economics">this excellent article </a>about freeconomics, and you should too. 

This afternoon: P11ds. It's not all fun, fun, fun at SnowCentral.  <br/>Emma
