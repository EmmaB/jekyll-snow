I have *so* maintained email zero for, like, weeks now. Tra la la. If you are waiting for anything from me, well, I've lost your email. You'd better resend it. Sorry. 

{update} Ooh, Rob makes a good point. That doesn't include submissions, which all go to a separate email address. Don't resend submissions if we haven't replied!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
