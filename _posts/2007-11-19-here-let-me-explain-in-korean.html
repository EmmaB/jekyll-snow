Just a little addendum to talk of e-book readers. Sometimes people who haven't seen an electrophoretic display assume that it looks like the display on a phone. But they're not the same at all. If the photos (left) don't make the difference obvious then may I recommend learning Korean. (The device in the picture is called a Nuut, and to learn more about it I've added a link <a href="http://nuutbook.com/">here</a>. But really, if Hangul is all Greek to you, there's not much point in clicking on it.)  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
