Rob pointed me at this. It is very excellent and tells you all about the shenanigans at CERN.

And, as ever on YouTube, the comments are both mystifying and often amusing. For instance: 
"omfg calm down take some chill pills dude its not gonna make a black hole" <em>Rob's comment:</em> Just for people keeping tracking of these things, they haven't collided anything with anything else yet. They're planning to run some slower beams into each other in a few days and then turn the power up in a few weeks. Not that this machine will destroy the world, but if it were going to do so, it wouldn't do it yet. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
