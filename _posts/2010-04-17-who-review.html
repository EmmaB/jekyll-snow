Sigh. On the million to one chance that you acted in or wrote tonight's Doctor Who episode stop reading now, because I'm going to be horrible about you. I still think Karen Gillan (=Amy) is great value for money - and Bill Patterson (=Bracewell) conjured up a bit of magic when called upon. But everything and everyone else was horrible. I'm afraid Ian McNeice's (=Churchill) talents are invisible to me; I don't care much for any of Mark Gatiss's scripts - charming fellow though he appears to be - and an unbearable thought is beginning to dawn on me: I am starting to suspect that Matt Smith can't act. My theory of bad acting is that those without ability can only do two things 1) confusion and 2) anger. That's all Martha Jones could manage and I'm starting to think it's all Matt Smith can summon up as well. Why couldn't David Tennant have put in one more year? Steven Moffat scripts, the marvellous Karen Gillan, and DT wringing every last bead of emotion from the drama. Alas. What might have been.  <br/>Rob
