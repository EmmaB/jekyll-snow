Right. I am not going to write any more blog posts until all 10,000 of you unique visitors (if that <em>is</em> your real name) vote and leave a comment about one or all of Needle in the Blood, Lint and Adept on the <a href="http://www.worldbookday.com/spreadtheword/">Spread the Word</a> website. 

[Folds arms, taps finger on upper arm].

This is one of the biggest chances we've had for ages. Think of our authors! Do it for them. Think of all the hours of entertainment Rob and I provide for you via the SnowBlog! Do it for us. Think of ... how good you will feel by doing something that will help us survive. You like indie publishers, don't you? You don't really want the world to be dominated by Mr Hachette's Livres, do you? I thought not. VOTE NOW! 

I'd be awfully grateful. x
