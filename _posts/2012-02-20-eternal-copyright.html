<a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/adrianhon/100007156/infinite-copyright-a-modest-proposal/">A jaunty article </a> in the Telegraph today in which the author (following in the footsteps of Swift's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modest_proposal">Modest Proposal</a>) suggests we no longer limit copyright to a mere seventy years after the death of the creator and do the sensible thing: move to Eternal Copyright. 

Excerpt: "<code>Under the current system, if you lived to 70 years old and your descendants all had children at the age of 30, the copyright in your book  and thus the proceeds  would provide for your children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren. But what, I ask, about your great-great-great-grandchildren? ...With eternal copyright, the knowledge that our great-great-great-grandchildren and beyond will benefit financially from our efforts will no doubt spur us on to achieve greater creative heights than ever seen before.</code>"  <br/>Rob
