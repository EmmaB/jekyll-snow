Some unrelated bits and bobs:
* <strong>Multitaskers struggle to... ?</strong>
When someone says to me, "Keep talking; I *am* listening," while they do something else I've never been too impressed with the results. Anecdotally and over-generalistically, I get the impression that many under-20s never do just *one* thing: if they're watching TV, they're also on FaceBook or playing a game. Wasn't like that in my day, harrumph (though I'm a low-level multi-tasker myself). Obviously if you multi-task you're unlikely to do any one of your activities as well as a single-tasker, but you're also constantly challenging your brain to cope with multiple inputs, so I was interested to read this <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/04/its-not-just-rude-its-ruining-your-brain">discussion of a study</a> which tried to work out what new mental skills multi-taskers had acquired. The answer amused me. (<a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/04/its-not-just-rude-its-ruining-your-brain">link</a>)
* <strong>Bugs</strong>
I read a lot more non-fiction than fiction. I may not be making my soul more beautiful with this choice, but I certainly learn a lot more stuff about the world. I'm still at the very early stages of reading a book about MRSA at the moment (=<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Superbug/dp/B003YRJBME/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1303283917&sr=8-2">Superbug</a>). It's terrifying so far and is likely to turn me into a Howard Hughes-style recluse. Well-written, interesting and full of very unwelcome information. Do your best to avoid it.
* <strong>Farewell</strong>
And finally something that makes me sad: Lis Sladen, the lady who played Sarah-Jane Smith on Doctor Who - both when I was little and in the last few years - has died from cancer. I was so surprised because she always looked so fantastic that I thought she must be fit as a flea. I can't remember ever seeing a woman in her sixties look so great in a pair of jeans and a leather jacket and I loved the character she played. I think you can often tell when an actor is really a great person and no one seems to have had a bad word to say about Lis Sladen.  (I would have spelled her name 'Liz' but I'm seeing it as 'Lis' in newspaper stories.)
