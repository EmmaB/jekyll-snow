God knows where I found the time, but I did an OU course in Bookkeeping and Accounting recently, to better understand, you know, accounts. And I just got the results - I passed! So now I can apply to be a member of the Institute of Accountants and Bookkeepers. Can't wait for *that* Christmas party.
