Any William Gibson fans out there? And are any of you would-be or fledgling writers? The great man has been answering dozens of questions about his writing over on his blog. The internet being what it is, you could be <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2010_04_01_archive.asp#2870745173546130026">over there</a> in a jiffy. I'm not entirely certain whether you'll learn anything, but just reading the way he answers questions makes me want to write something.  <br/>Rob
