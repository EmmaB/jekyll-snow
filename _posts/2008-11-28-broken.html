Just want to check whether the comments system of the SnowBlog is broken. Occasionally people mention difficulty in submitting comments. Sometimes they get a message that starts: <span style="font-family: courier;">"In an effort to curb malicious comment posting by abusive users, I've enabled a feature that requires a weblog commenter to wait a short amount of time before being able to post again..."</span> I'm going to track that message down and change it because it's not really telling the truth. Really it means you slipped up filling in your details and answering the super-secret anti-spam question. If you double-check that you've filled in all the things you're supposed to and still can't post a comment, could you let me know?

<em>update</em>: Well, thanks to everyone for all the detective work. It sounds like typing in the super-secret anti-spam word with a leading capital causes problems. I've changed the comments form to make it clear that capitals are bad. Sorry to anyone who'd tried to post their thoughts here and been unsuccessful. With any luck it will be a little easier now.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
