If I'm at my desk*, I have a terminal window open, running a log of what's happening on snowbooks.com. Yes, it is a bit like that bit in the Matrix where the bloke looks at a series of green characters on a screen, and sees a woman in a slinky red dress. And yes, it is weird that I can see every link that you click on, as you click on it. 

But don't feel self-conscious. You just carry on. Don't you worry about me. I'll just be over here.
