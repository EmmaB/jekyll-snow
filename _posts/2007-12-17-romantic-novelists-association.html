Huge congrats to our new sales partners Allison and Busby on the inclusion of <em>Crooked Pieces </em>by Sarah Grazebrook in the Romantic Novelists Association Romantic Novel longlist. But forgive me for a moment if I complain about the glaring omission of Needle in the Blood. Uh, hello? Everyone I've spoken to who's read Needle has remarked on how it is an extraordinary, brilliant, enjoyable romantic novel. 

I am completely put out. And yes, I'm being a bad loser. But I think they've overlooked an important book and that they are wrong to do so. Still, if the prize gods believe that we are only allowed one prize per book, I'd rather hold out for the Orange...  <br/>Emma
