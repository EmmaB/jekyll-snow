The night before last I got a late night phone call. It was the BBC World Service asking if I could put them in touch with a surrealist author for an interview. I did, and the result is here: a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/p0047lpl">late night interview</a> (iplayer link, go 20 minutes 17 seconds in) recorded at stupid o'-clock with Steve Aylett. Surreal all round, really.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
