Oh, boy, can I recommend this week's Pr&ecirc;t &agrave; Manger Veggie Special. It has mustard, gherkins, cheese, lettuce, tomato and some mystery ingredient that makes it just amazing. 

(I hope the mystery ingredient isn't parma ham or something. 15-odd years of vegetarianism down the pan. Tasty, though.)  <br/>Emma
