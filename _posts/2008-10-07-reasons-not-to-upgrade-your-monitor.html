In the corner of my home office sits Snowbooks' server. Like all right-thinking computers, it has a name, and its name is Serenity after the ship in Joss Whedon's superb Firefly series. Since we have to do stuff to the server only rarely*, we don't really need it to have a monitor, but it's so handy to have a little one plugged in the whole time. We use an old, small, useless monitor for this purpose, and it does the job fine. However, it also serves (heh) a far more important purpose: big cat warmer. <img alt="serenity.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/serenity.jpg" width="400" height="282" />
