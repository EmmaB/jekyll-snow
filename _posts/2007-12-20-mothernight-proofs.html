As a very special seasonal treat I am going to make fifty copies of Mothernight available to five lucky groups. That's right - the first five groups - that's book groups, libraries, schools, organisations, Guides, the staffroom, the smoking room, whatever - to email me will get ten copies of Mothernight to read, review and enjoy. And hopefully discuss with their friends who can buy it when it comes out in March! 

I will post them out for free, but to one address only. If your group happens to have a few more than ten members, then still email in and I'll accommodate you if I can.
