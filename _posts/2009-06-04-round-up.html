Various excellent items to share. Firstly, there's a lovely review of The Letters <a href="http://anaspiereviews.blogspot.com/2009/06/letters-by-fiona-robyn.html">here. </a> Next, <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=406811&c=2">our man in Scotland</a> appears in the Times Higher Education magazine this week, looking very suave. Finally, a fantastic first for Snowbooks: Thomas Emson has his own label! How cool! <img alt="dyf.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/dyf.jpg" width="400" /> <br/>Emma
