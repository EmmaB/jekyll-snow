The gentlefolk at <a href="http://www.itv.com/Lifestyle/ThisMorning/default.html">This Morning</a>, who I am given to understand broadcast a popular daily entertainment on national television, have been kind enough to feature Leila's book <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005758.html">How To Worry Friends And Inconvenience People</a> in one of their 'online' competitions.  <a href="http://www.itv.com/Lifestyle/ThisMorning/competitions/online/HowtoWorryFriends/default.html">Defeat their intellectual conundra</a> and you stand to receive a copy of Leila's book gratis and with <em>no money down</em>! Isn't television a marvelous thing?  <br/>Rob
