Just seen <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/blog/2008/sep/17/tonyblair.politicsandthearts">this</a>: Tony Blair is going to appear on The Daily Show. That is very good news, because Jon Stewart (a big Snowbooks hero) has this astonishing gift for being quite charming then making a few sharp, incisive questions that expose people for what they really are - all the time being extremely funny. I can't wait to see this.  <br/>Emma
