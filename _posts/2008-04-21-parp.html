On the online Bookseller there's a story about some nominees for this year's <em>Women in Publishing</em> award: 

<span style="font-family: courier; color: darkblue;">"Agent Clare Alexander, Viking's Eleo Gordon, Egmont's Alison Kennedy and Jessica Kingsley are this year's selection for Booktrust's Kim Scott Walwyn Prize."</span>

And some comments: 

By down by the beach
<span style="font-family: courier; color: darkblue;">"Be nice to see Emma Barnes on the list - apart from her obvious achivements, it would also be quite funny if it was won by an 'Emma'." </span>

By Freya Gordon
<span style="font-family: courier; color: darkblue;">"Jessica Kingsley has worked tirelessly publishing books to increase everyone's knowledge on autism and mental health. Emma Barnes believes in herself more than anyone else does. She's quite new and I am already tired of hearing her blow her own large trumpet." </span>

Poor Freya. I shall try to keep my parps to a minimum. Have we ever met, by the way?  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
