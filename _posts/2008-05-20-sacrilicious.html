I try not to just copy things off of <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/05/20/laptop-covered-in-ch.html">BoingBoing</a> and say 'Look! I discovered something!'. Mr. Doctorow might have picked this story up, but I think I would have got their own my own soon enough, because this relates to Russell M. Davies (he of the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Egg-Bacon-Chips-Beans-Great/dp/0007213786/ref=sr_1_1/203-5688651-9881538?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194719952&sr=8-1">Eggs, Bacon, Chips and Beans</a> wonder-tome, not he of the sputtering Who franchise (if that makes any sense)) and he's someone I've already <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/11/books_that_should_succeed.html">blogged about</a> and swapped comments with.
