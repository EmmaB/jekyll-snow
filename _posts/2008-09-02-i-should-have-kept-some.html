Blimey charlie: The Affinity Bridge slipcase is a collector's item already! <a href="http://www.bensheddlingbooks.co.uk/bookdetail.asp?bid=814">This chap</a> has his marked up at 59.99. Remember, you can <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/shop_9781905005932.html">get yours for just 30.</a> 

Ps: can you imagine how cool my job is? I get to do what I want all day, design lovely, lovely covers, mint my own currency, go for a walk or a sleep when I fancy it... I'm proper charmed, me.  <br/>Emma
