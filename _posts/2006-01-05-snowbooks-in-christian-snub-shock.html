Check out this <a href="http://www.christianbookshops.org.uk/news.htm">charmless post</a>. What are those Christian values again - respect, humility, generosity, absence of self righteousness, not holding a grudge (thanks to <a href="http://www.twopaths.com/faq_ChristianValues.htm">this site</a> for the reminder)? Seems that the Christian Bookshops webmaster needs to revisit his Bible.

Ah, I'm probably just narked because I'm on a diet. Not enough blood-sugar.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
