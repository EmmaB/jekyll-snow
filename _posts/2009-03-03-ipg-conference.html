Every time I type that acronym - *every* time - I get the first and second letters the wrong way round. One of these days I'm not going to notice. 

It's the IPG (did it again) conference this weekend, which I'm *so* looking forward to. The programme looks very good, but it's the catching up with people bit which I'm most excited about. It's in Brighton so I hope the weather picks up. If you're going, I'll see you there! If you're not, well, I guess I won't. But you'll be missed. 

ps. Andy's coming with me too, and will for the most part be looking after Ro in the hotel room, because he is the best husband and father in the land. <em>Rob's comment:</em> 
I've made a stab at the new logo they could use if Em ever gets it wrong.
