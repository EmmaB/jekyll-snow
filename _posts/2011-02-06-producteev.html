Whilst I'm on a 'recommends' roll, let me also tell you about <a href="https://www.producteev.com/">Producteev</a>, a cloud-based to-do list manager. I've been using it for my to-do list for a while, and it's really rather good. You can create separate workspaces, and do all the usual stuff: flag by priority, add a date, label, notes, . Best of all, it's collaborative, so I can invite people to share my space and allocate tasks to them. There's an iPhone app that actually syncs properly, too, which is a boon. Plus they have a good blog. <a href="http://blog.producteev.com/staff-picks-articles-on-productivity">Here's a good post</a>. 

Right. Posting about that was a handy displacement activity. Back to putting things into moving boxes* and tinkering with php tags. 

* You know what I mean. Boxes to move house, not boxes that move. Picky.
