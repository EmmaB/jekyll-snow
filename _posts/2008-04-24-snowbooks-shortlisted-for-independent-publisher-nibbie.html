Wheeeee! We're on the shortlist for the Independent Publisher Nibbie this year! 

Also on the shortlist are: 

- Atlantic Books
- Michael O'Mara
- Quercus
- Summersdale

Wow, tough list. So good luck to us all. Especially us and Summersdale! 

That means that I can <em>definitely </em>buy a new frock, because we're up for two Nibbies now - this and the Innovation one for our <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/04/shortlisted_for_a_nibbie.html">XSL work</a>. I think I will buy <a href="http://www.isabellaoliver.com/maternity-clothes/maternity-dresses/The-Wrap-Dress/D/30100/P/2:100:1020/I/DR52">this one</a> plus accessories. Do you think it's too plain? It's a lot of money but I figure I can wear it in the daytime too, and possibly when I'm not pregnant too, even though I might stretch the fabric a bit! 

Very very happy. Prizes are nice.  <br/>Emma
