You'll recall that at the start of this year Rob, Robin and I started a new business, <a href="http://www.onixcentral.com">Onix Central,</a> You'll be pleased to know it's going very well indeed, to  the point that we're now hiring. (And getting an office in Oxfordshire which will have its very own post.)

Click below the line or <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/Onix%20admin.pdf">download</a> a job spec for Onix Administrators. This is a superb opportunity for someone looking for their first break in publishing - probably a recent graduate. It's a 6 month contract - this isn't a job for life, but instead will get you a CV to die for. You'll be working for me, so you'll also be able to learn about how Snowbooks works. And judging by the many applications I get for unpaid work experience, I'm sure that the prospect of a paid job where you learn this stuff is rather fine. 

You will have to be very comfortable with computers. I'm not necessarily expecting you to be able to process XSLT using Eclipse on the first day, although that would be great,  but I need you to be fascinated by what I'm talking about and keen to learn. In fact, you should be googling it right now. (And heads up: if you come to interview, guess what I'm going to ask?) Ideally, you don't just use Amazon: you dig around in their API. You don't just Twitter: you write little Twitter apps. You blog, but you've installed it yourself and tweaked the CSS to your tastes.
