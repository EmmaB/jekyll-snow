I've only just realised this, but Indesign CS3 doesn't support cross references. Astonishing. I bet, actually, that Adobe fixed this in 1999 but is eeking out functionality like this across twenty years of releases so we keep paying a grand every 18 months for each new release. Bah.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
