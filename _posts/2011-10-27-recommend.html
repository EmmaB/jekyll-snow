<a href="http://www.spauda.com/?q=en">Spauda</a> in Lithuania have just completed their first print job for us. The quality of the work is simply excellent - colour balance is so finely done as to make a grown man weep, binding is gorgeous, paper stock quality is stunning, timeliness was spot on, price for a 2000 unit run was superb. Mind you, they've had enough time to perfect their business: they started in 1574. Don't hesitate to drop me a line to get the sales manager's email address. Hooray for Spauda!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
