It's highly unlikely that anyone except me will find this useful. But I have to admit that sometimes I use this blog to make a note just for myself to refer back to later. Evil, I know. Anyway, if you want to know some arcane function in Excel, click on. This: 

=IF(ISERROR(VLOOKUP(F42,Sheet1!B:F,5,FALSE)),"-",VLOOKUP(F42,Sheet1!B:F,5,FALSE))

is very handy. A normal IF function looks like this: 

=IF(VLOOKUP(F54,Sheet1!B:F,5,FALSE),VLOOKUP(F54,Sheet1!B:F,5,FALSE),"-")

That means:

IF the Vlookup function is true, return the result of the Vlookup, otherwise return a dash in the cell. 

It looks more complicated than it is - it's simply saying if(this logical test is),(true, return this value),(false, return this value).

However, if the test returns an #N/A, you have to manually delete the cell, because it won't sum if it's in a range of cells that needs to be summed. And in a scale out, which is what I mainly use Vlookups for nowadays, that takes about a minute. A minute that I could be profitably using looking out of the window, or petting the cats. So naturally it must be eliminated. 

So by inserting an ISERROR function as in

=IF(<strong>ISERROR</strong>(VLOOKUP(F42,Sheet1!B:F,5,FALSE)<strong>)</strong>,"-",VLOOKUP(F42,Sheet1!B:F,5,FALSE))

You can get rid of the #N/As automatically. Magic! 

Oh, no-one's reading this. Em of the future, when you search for this post next time you do a scale out: just remember that the ISERROR function will get rid of those annoying #N/As. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
