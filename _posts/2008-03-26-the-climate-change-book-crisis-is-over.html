About <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2007/04/if_the_news_has_taught_us_anyt_1.html">this time last year</a>, I was looking for a book on climate change. I tried a couple of bookshops, including a major Borders and there was almost nothing. Books refuting the climate change 'hoax' were there, but none propounding the 'hoax' itself. But earlier this week I looked again and there are heaps of books. More than I have time to read. We might not have actually done anything quite yet to avert the coming catastrophe, but at least publishers are playing their part by helping us get informed. I still hold out some hope that we won't actually need to be underwater before we react and books have to be a good start. Thanks, World of Publishing!  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
