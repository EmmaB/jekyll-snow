I've been getting on very well with the covetable HP 2133 mini-notebook that I wrote about <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/05/most_shiny.html">here</a>. I did wonder whether a longlife battery might be a good idea, though. Apparently HP sell them for $129 in the States. Not a huge surprise to find that they were 109 here. At no time in the last six months has that been less than a 60% price hike for the same product on this side of the Atlantic. But I was even more horrified to see that a replacement screen could cost me 391. It seems a bit steep considering the whole machine retails for 300 + VAT. But then I suppose someone has to disassemble one, take out the screen and put it in a box. It's only fair to charge for that.  <br/>Rob
