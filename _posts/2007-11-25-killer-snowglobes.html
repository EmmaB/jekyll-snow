Thanks to my lovely mum, for sending this sort of <a href="http://ww12.e-tractions.com/snowglobe/globe.htm">snow-related thing</a>! Just the thing for those of us who are easily entertained of a Sunday night. Hooray for the Christmas period, when things get progressively more and more snowy. It's like the world is doing our marketing for us.
