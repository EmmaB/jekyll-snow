Whilst I loll around the house, Anna is striding the halls of the Buchmesse in Frankfurt. And because I'm lolling around the house I have no news to report. Funnily, though, if I shut my eyes I can immediately picture the row that we always have a stand on, and can taste the coffee (not good) and the white bread sandwiches that cost a fiver each. And I can feel the sense of tension in the air as everyone tries to make a buck, strike a deal, forge new partnerships. Thrilling on one level, yes, but far more exhausting than looking after a newborn.I guess the point of this post is: thanks, Anna! I'll get back to my idling, now.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
