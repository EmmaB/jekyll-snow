In <a href="http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists/will_self/article3301717.ece">Will Self's column,</a> no less, where in a piece on Psychogeography he writes:

"Lewes, Sussex, where this column began all those horned moons ago. As I walk from the station under another horned moon I spy, standing outside a cosy looking pub, the cuddly dolmen of Matthew De Abaitua. Thirteen years ago, Matthew  who is now a talented novelist in his own right  spent a six-month sojourn as my live-in amanuensis and secretary. It was a thankless task: so far as I can remember I was completely spark-a-loco. We were living in a tiny cottage in Suffolk, and I was given to harvesting opium from the poppies that grew wild in the field margins, then driving my Citro* deux-chevaux across the same fields, solely by the light of a horned moon, Matthew placidly crammed into the passenger seat."

And it goes on but I'd better not copy any more for fear of violating fair use. So go and take a gander now.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
