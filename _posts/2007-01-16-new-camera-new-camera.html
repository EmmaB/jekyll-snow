I got a new camera! Eee! Ready for my HOLIDAY to Devon next week. Here are my first photos:

Bowl of Glass Bits With Needle (left over from when Gilly was tapestrying the cover to Needle in the Blood. Damn, but our editors are dedicated):

I am going to be such a pain in the neck over the next few weeks. Everybody must stand still and wait patiently whilst I try to get the light just right, and try to remember whether it's a small or large number that means the aperture is open or shut...  <br/>Emma
