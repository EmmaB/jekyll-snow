That as well as being ONIX geeks, we design book covers for other publishers as well as our own? Here are some covers we have done. They sell books. See more in our <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/snowshop.html">catalogue </a> and on <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/angels_design.html">SnowAngels</a>.

You should really get in touch: we charge 595 per cover, all in, for paperback and hardback, including finishes (spot UV, embossing, foiling etc) and printer ready PDFs, inclusive of any original or licensed artwork. Once you've paid, there are no ongoing royalties or anything - we'll send you the layered .psd files to do with as you please. And we'll keep tweaking until it's right. 

I have been approached by lots of external designers wanting to pitch for Snowbooks covers, and so I know that our prices are definitely a bargain. No, we don't charge less just because you're tiny. The cover is the greatest selling tool you have, and 595 is a small investment to get it right.
