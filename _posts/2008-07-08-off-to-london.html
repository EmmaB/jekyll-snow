To see the queen. Well, not really the queen. Just Tottenham Court Road and environs, really. But this is the third to last time that I'm planning to be in London until I pop in September / October. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a source of great joy to me. 

It's quite all right, actually, going to London for a day trip. I can poddle to the station in 10 minutes; the train takes under an hour, and then, well, you're in London, aren't you. Muay conveniento. I will take <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Vesuvius-Club-Lucifer-Box-Novel/dp/0743257057">The Vesuvius Club</a> to read which Andy was chortling over last night. I want a go. 

I have also been thinking about all the ways I am completely inherently disorganised, too, and have been feeling a bit guilty about going on about how organised I appear to be in my desk post below. My desk is one thing; the confused chaos rattling around in my head most days is quite another. You should have seen my computer desktop last week before I reorganised it - there were so many files on it the icons couldn't all fit on my (28") screen.  I think that's why people like me try to maintain some sort of system to keep everything in order - because if we didn't it would get very ugly, very quickly. Anyway, I didn't want you to think I was doing that trumpet thing again.

Right. To the trains!  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
