I have been treated to the most adorable present today! Look at this which arrived from the wife of one of our authors. 

<img alt="ro1.jpg" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/ro1.jpg" width="400" height="263" /> I should really have waited until tomorrow to post about this, as the light today is very dreary and so these photos don't do it justice. I may re-take them tomorrow if it's brighter - but if this is it, and it's now winter until May 2009, then these will have to do.

The most wonderful thing is that Fiona the artist takes commissions - so you could have your very own personalised keepsakes box too! <a href="mailto:emma@snowbooks.com">Drop me a line </a>and I'll put you in touch. <br/>Emma
