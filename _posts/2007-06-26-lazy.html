I am a *very* lazy person. So lazy, in fact, that I tend to just whack blog posts up there without bothering to find a picture to go with them. Rob tends to drop by and add an image he likes, because he knows that blog posts are more interesting if they have a picture to go with them, and also because he is not lazy. No. He is Good. 

I wonder what image he'll choose to go with this post?  <br/>Emma
