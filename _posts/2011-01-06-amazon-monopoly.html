The Amazon.com Kindle Store boasts "775,000 ebooks, newspapers, magazines, blogs, and popular games & active content". I'm not sure quite how to read that, because I'm much more interested in eBook sales than blogs and games. But <a href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/Research/ebook_buying_is_about_to_spiral_upward/q/id/57664/t/2">Forrester Research</a> have estimated that eBook sales were $1bn, just in the U.S., for 2010 and will be triple that by 2015. They also believe that 50% of recent eBook purchases were from the Kindle store*.

So, does that mean that the Kindle store is turning over half a billion dollars in the States alone? That sounds ludicrously high to me, but what I don't have a problem with accepting would be the idea that Amazon currently dominate the eBook market. It's ridiculously easy, once you're all set up, to buy an eBook from them. When I finished the 2nd Stieg Larsson book at 00:15 on New Year's morning, and realised I'd need to buy the 3rd book straightaway to find out what happened next, I think it's safe to say that I'd have been out of luck if I'd needed a paper copy. But it took less then a minute to find, purchase and start reading Book Three on the Kindle. So the Kindle store has the convenience and the multi-platform reach (I can switch between reading the same Kindle book on my iPad, iPhone, a Mac and a current-generation Kindle reader - and there are other platforms available for devices I don't use). And, most significantly, the Kindle Store has the dominant range. I don't want to have to buy different eBooks from different stores and download them in different formats to run on different devices or apps. I don't want to have to remember I bought this from Kobo, but that's in iBooks. So it's perilously tempting to consider myself a Kindle customer for the foreseeable future. Which is a little bit worrying if you think about it. We're heading towards Amazon having a clear monopoly on eBooks that they could never have achieved in the world of ink-on-paper.

I had an interesting chat with Oli Brooks of <a href="http://completelynovel.com/">CompletelyNovel</a> about this and I wondered aloud whether the web will soon need a Monopoly & Mergers Commission and Anti-Trust Laws - and how such a thing could possibly work. Oli thought the low barriers to entry on the web meant that breaking Amazon's monopoly was still possible with the right innovative technology in a way it might not be in the offline world.

What do you guys think? Are you worried about a world in which eBooks are a huge share of the market and most of that huge share goes through Amazon? Do you think the Amazon monopoly will be a temporary thing? (Or maybe you're still convinced that eBooks are a fad.)

*At least I <em>think</em> that's what they said. The phrasing is a little ambiguous. <br/>Rob
