11 months ago the pound reversed its long trend and begin to slightly weaken against the dollar. Six weeks ago it fell off a cliff. It's gone from $2.00 to $1.76 in that time. What's wrong with the UK economy that isn't more wrong with America's? Surely they're sinking faster than we are. Anyone able to explain it for me?  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
