I wrote a guest post for How Publishing Really Works. Read it <a href="http://howpublishingreallyworks.blogspot.com/2009/02/snowbooks-on-marketing.html">here.</a> I note that one miserable person clicked on the button to signify that it was 'not helpful'. I'm so sorry, sir or madam. I'll try to be more helpful in future.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
