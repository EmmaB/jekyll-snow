If you've come here from the <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/news/43554-snowbooks-provides-showcase-for-authors.html">Bookseller article</a>, hello! Have a look around. You'll find the 'snowcase' blog posts marked as such if you scroll down. Peppered amongst them is the usual Snowblog fare: zombies, politics, sandwich recommendations, linguistics, notes on which authors I fancy, pony pictures and references to me being on Radio 4. Something for everyone, really. 

In other parts of the site is our <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/rejection.html">world famous open rejection letter</a>, our <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/catalogue.html">online catalogue</a>, <a href="http://www.snowbooksdesign.com/">Snowbooks Design Services</a> and our <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/freebooksclub.html">free books club</a>. You could spend all day here, really. 

In other news: I feel the need, the need for speed! It's Top Gun's 20th birthday today. Lordy, aren't we *old*? <br/><hr/><br/>

From Rob: I'm surprised there are no comments yet from John and Judith A-W here. When I was in my mid-twenties, I would go round to John A-W's bachelor flat to drink his booze and he'd sometimes suggest watching a video. 'A video' being the operative phrase because he only owned one. Top Gun. Of course there was always Judith's one video - Dirty Dancing - if we got tired of making fun of Maverick. But that didn't happen very often. Somewhat against my will, I've seen that movie dozens of times. Thank goodness I drank in those days. <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
