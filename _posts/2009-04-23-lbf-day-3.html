One word: <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1894592/">Michael Tamblyn</a>. (I *know*. It is the humour.) He's my hero - I have watched <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1894592/">his speech</a> a gazillion times. Crucial viewing if you haven't already seen it. 

<a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bibliocloudimages/snowblog/MTReal.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/MTReal.html','popup','width=350,height=266,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="MT.jpg" src="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/MT.jpg" width="350" height="266" /><p style="margin: 0pc 0px 0px 80px;">click to see the conversation</p></a>

PS. I'm not that fat in real life. Nor do I have such stupid hair. And there's normally a baby in that sling. Anna had taken him for a walk around the block so I could get a word in edgeways.  <br/>Emma
