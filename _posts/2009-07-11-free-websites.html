You know me. Time poor and money poor. Not the best combination. So believe me when I say: when I want to set up a website, I do it quickly and cheaply. It breaks my heart to hear people I care about (or even people I don't even know, like a dairy farmer I heard on Radio 4 the other day) saying that they spent 2000 on their website. So I've written out how to do it for free, or almost free. Go to <a href="http://www.website4free.org ">www.website4free.org </a>to see how to set up a Wordpress based website. I'll be adding a way to set up a website for completely free except for the price of the domain name (about a fiver) in the next week or so. 

You can thank me by buying a book or two.  <br/>Emma
