but Elle McPherson too! Now I am really excited. According to a Telegraph <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/01/ngarter01.xml">article</a> this week, Elle McPherson and Jacqueline Gold have been invited to the same shindig at the palace that I am going to. I wonder who else will be there. 

On a more troubling note - what the hell do you wear to look passable - even human - next to The Body? PANIC!  <br/>Emma
