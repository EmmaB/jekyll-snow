Lordy, I've just found out that some cover designers charge upwards of two grand! If I were still an employee of some firm or other, charged with maximising shareholder value, I'd be tempted to respond to that information by putting my prices up. Instead, however, I'm delighted to say - come to <a href="http://www.snowbooksdesign.com">Snowbooks Design</a> for a sales-focused cover that will only set you back &pound;600! Get-em-while-they're-hot-they're-lovely.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
