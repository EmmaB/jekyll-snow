Hooray, there's an <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2215448,00.html">article in the Guardian</a> about Spread the Word and our books are named. Well done Steve and Sarah for having surnames that put them pretty much at the top of the list. And for Adept, hopefully the next list will be alphabetically sorted by title name. 

Thanks so much to Dee, Moali and Billectric for the comments made on Needle and Lint, and, presumeably, for their vote. Please add your own!
