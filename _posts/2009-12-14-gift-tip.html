What with it being Christmas soon, and men everywhere (maybe even some disorganised/busy women) are starting to think about Christmas shopping, I feel I should mention that <a href="http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/12208778/The-West-Wing-The-Complete-Box-Set-Seasons-1-7/Product.html">play.com</a> have the entire, seven-season box set of The West Wing for<a href="http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/12208778/The-West-Wing-The-Complete-Box-Set-Seasons-1-7/Product.html"> 39.95</a>, including delivery. That's giftacular and Christmificent, in my view. That works out at around 36p per hour for some of the best TV ever made.  <br/>Rob
