Al Gore got a Nobel Prize. W00t! Em and I were talking the other day about whether it was far fetched for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Bartlet">Jed Bartlet</a> to be a Nobel Laureate President. Well, if I can't have Jed Bartlet as President, can I please have Al Gore? No? Well, I'd like him anyway.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
