Oh happy day! Hello everyone! Hello!

*Maybe* I've had a little bit too much coffee. *Maybe* I'm just having a good start to the week. *Maybe* I had a nice weekend walk at Rob's in the countryside. *Maybe* I'm slightly overwhelmed by how many good books we suddenly have - Needle, Plunge, City Cycling, Book of Names. *Maybe* the fact that two cheques have cleared this morning at a higher exchange rate than I thought would be applied is like free money, and everyone likes free money. *Maybe* my discovery of 13 reviews that average out at four and a half stars of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/customer-reviews/1905005474/sr=1-1/qid=1185783215/ref=cm_cr_dp_2_1/202-2700263-5142214?ie=UTF8&customer-reviews.sort%5Fby=-SubmissionDate&n=266239&qid=1185783215&sr=1-1">Monster Island </a>just now has tipped me over the edge! 

Let's hope the day carries on like this!  <br/>Emma
