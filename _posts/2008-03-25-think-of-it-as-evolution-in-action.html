Whilst I want to get rid of the cute little mice who sneak into my kitchen, I don't want to kill them. I surprised one today in the cupboard under my sink. It was inside a box, which it jumped out of when it saw me. It had hauled out one of the delicious morsels I keep in that box and chewed open the wrapping. I hope for its sake it hadn't eaten much. They're Calgon tablets and they get rid of limescale in your washing-machine. They will not do a small, muddle-headed mouse any good whatsoever.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
