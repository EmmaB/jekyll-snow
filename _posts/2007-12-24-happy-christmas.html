And so this is Christmas, and what have we done? I am too enthusiastic about the future to do a retrospective on 2007, to be honest, so if you want to remember what we've done then browse the archives on the sidebar!  

2008 is full of promise: some outstanding books that have already had some excellent feedback, a fantastically exciting Cycling range in development, our new alliance with Susie and team, the launch of SnowAngels, a gorgeous new website in the new year that I've been working on for the last few days and the chance of making our star shine even brighter. So much opportunity! 

So have a very lovely festive break, and see you in the New Year where Rob, Anna and I will look forward to bringing you the finest in independent publishing for another year. Thanks for your support in 2007 and here's to the new one!  <br/>Emma
