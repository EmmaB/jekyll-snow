Not sure how fierce the B**tish B**adcasting C**poration's lawyers are, but I thought I'd take a chance and post a clip from the last episode of the recently bygone second season of the masterful radio comedy <em>F*gs, M*gs and B*gs</em>. Why? Because it's so good and I want you to know about it. Here, the shop's proprietor is explaining confectionery history to his eldest son. (The asterisks, and lack of names, are to stop said lawyers simply googling their way to this particular infraction.) <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/FMB%20s2e6%20excerpt.mp3">mp3 link</a>  <br/>Rob
