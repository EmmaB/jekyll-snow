Ooooh, look <a href="http://www.audible.co.uk/aduk/site/product.jsp?p=BK_ACTN_000015UK&BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">here</a>. Or listen, rather, to the new audio book of The Affinity Bridge. It's the first in a series of Audio Snowbooks (Snaubooks, if you will) coming over the next few months. Next up: The Osiris Ritual and The Clamour King. 

Isn't it weird, and also super, to hear a familiar book read aloud? There's a clip on the Audible site where that link above goes to for you to have a listen.  <br/>Emma
