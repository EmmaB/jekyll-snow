Do you see what I did there? With the title of this post? Because, heh, the funny joke is that returns aren't happy, are they, they're never a happy event, but it's my birthday today, so I did a clever play on... oh, never mind. 

Yep, 35 today. That didn't sound so bad until someone pointed out that it promotes me to the 35-44 demographic. Still, 35 with a glorious nearly one-year-old, a glorious husband, lovely friends and family, a wonderful company, another wonderful company, two cats, living in the country and eating bagels covered with seville marmalade isn't too bad, is it. No it is not. Although Ro did wee on my foot this morning. 

Anyway, many happy returns to me. (That one doesn't get old, does it?)  <br/>Emma
