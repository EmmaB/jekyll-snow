We're looking forward very much to publishing Mark Ames' excellent and incisive analysis of workplace and school shootings, <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/web9781905005345.html">Going Postal</a>, in the New Year. For those with an interest in Mark's background in journalism, you could do worse than check out <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1822802.ece">this piece in the UK Independent</a>, although it hardly does justice to the monument to fearless investigation and horrendously bad taste that is <a href="http://www.exile.ru/">The eXile</a>.

Mark is also a regular pundit over at the Guardian's Comment Is Free website. <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/mark_ames/">You can find his columns here</a> - many of them riffing on the same subjects he covers in the upcoming book. Rumours of a documentary based on the book were also circulating at Frankfurt, but we'll have to wait and see on that one...  <br/><h4></h4>
