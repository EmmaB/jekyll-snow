So. What's that we can see in the picture there? Well, firstly you can see a glimpse of my wonderful Bee Desk. So called because it's got bees all over it. But what you can also see is a credit card I was destroying earlier today because it's past its expiry date. After I'd snapped it in two, I absentmindedly peeled the top layer of plastic off and discovered a mystery grid underneath the hologram. Click on the pic to see for yourself. Weird and interesting, huh? But what does it mean? (I've smudged out the card number, so that's what the Photoshoppiness there is all about.)  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
