Don't say we never listen to you. Following a request from one of our readers, we've beefed up our feeds and stuck a gorblimey actual link in the sidebar ( &#8592; thataway) to make keeping up with the Snows that little bit easier. Ms Row, this one's for you.

If you don't know about RSS, Atom and the like, there's an <a href="http://blogtheinternet.com/2006/08/28/what-are-rss-feeds-part-one/">excellent guide here</a>. The BBC has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/3223484.stm">a good one too</a>. Oh, and if you'd been using <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> the feed would have been there all along mumble grumble (sound of publisher dragging feet down long stone-flagged corridor, shaking head at world, consoled by pipe).  <br/>
