If I was a lazy person, I would simply direct you to <a href="http://meandmybigmouth.typepad.com/scottpack/2009/03/eventful.html">this blog post</a>. But I am not lazy. No. Hence the following:

Book lovers! Attend the joint Launch Party of Danny Rhodes' <a href="http://www.dannyrhodes.net/">Soldier Boy</a> and Thomas Emson's <a href="http://www.dannyrhodes.net/">Skarlet</a>. It will be at the Secret Cellar (great name) and Castle Arts Gallery, Castle Street, Canterbury on Thursday 26th March 2009 7pm - 9pm. Feel free to drop in at any time for a glass of wine and some food, they say.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
