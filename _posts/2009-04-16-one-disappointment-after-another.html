MEP. The post has arrived, bringing, just in time, my lovely <a href="http://issuu.com/snowbooks/docs/marketing">AI books</a> for the book fair. And some bugger at the Post Office has managed to bash the parcel so effectively that all three copies have a huge fold down the middle. 

I am really upset. (I mean, I am upset as far as one can be upset by a ruined book.) I was looking forward to having these gorgeous articles to show off our lovely books, and now they have a big fold down the middle. I have them currently in the nipping press, trying to de-crease them. Later, I will get the iron out. 

This is Lulu's fault. Poor packaging. I was getting on so well with them until now. FAIL.  <br/><h4>Emma</h4>
