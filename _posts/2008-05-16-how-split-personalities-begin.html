There's a <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/in-depth/feature/58755-automatic-for-the-people.html">little piece</a> in the latest Bookseller sort of written by me. I wrote the first draft, but it's changed a bit since then. Something like that always seems to happen and it's a weird thing being rewritten. I like to think that with a clear brief I'm not a bad writer. I wrote a book about retail strategy a while back and the global head of McKinsey was very complimentary about it. Stuart Rose (boss of M&S) liked it enough to give a quote for the cover. I've also had some success with fiction. I think you could find my novels without too much trouble in most European countries (including this one). So all in all, I don't tend to feel like I need someone to step in and fix my prose for me. A hint or two is all I need. So if you happen to see the article and you wonder why, instead of ridiculing phrases like <span style="font-family: courier;">'Publishers often engage with questions of finance...'</span> or <span style="font-family: courier;">'The clarity this affords is paramount;'</span> I seem to suddenly be embracing that sort of corporate silly-speak, the answer is that my words were given a smart new suit of clothes and a haircut after I finished with them. I also would have baulked at humouring publishing technophobes to quite the extent I now appear to have done, but that's journalism for you. Just because I didn't <em>quite</em> say it and don't <em>entirely</em> stand by it doesn't mean it shouldn't be printed with my name on it. So why didn't I object? Because it's not a bad article, it's just not quite how I would have expressed myself. So I simply asked to share the byline with the author of so much of its content. And at least on the evidence of the <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/in-depth/feature/58755-automatic-for-the-people.html">online copy</a>, that seems to have been edited out as well. <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
