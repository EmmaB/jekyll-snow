Whoever drew <a href="http://i.imgur.com/GxzeV.jpg">this little 'infographic'</a> (click on the link or picture to see what I'm talking about) does a nice job of illustrating what I've said about DVD anti-piracy sermonising for a while now. The big advantage to stealing movies instead of paying for them is that you don't get treated like a criminal (you may wish to reread that sentence). If I could buy legitimate DVDs for maybe 50p extra that weren't loaded up with warnings, ads and trailers I think I'd go for it. Currently my only option would be to strip those things out myself, quite possibly breaking the law. I do hope we all get our heads screwed on straight about copyright before I have to read e-books full of ads, warnings and official threats.  <br/><h4>Rob</h4>
