Excellent. I've finally found a succinct description of what agency pricing is and a little bit about it on lovely NPR (<a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/12/08/143387594/apple-publishing-houses-face-antitrust-probe">here</a>). But I still haven't found a good article about the anti-competition and anti-trust lawsuits underway that relate to the use of agency pricing in the e-book market.

There's an article in the FT today about that sort of thing and about the Amazon $5 rebate if you leave a bookshop <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2011/12/amazon_vs_local_bookshop.html">empty-handed</a>, but a) you might find you have to register (for free, though) in order to read it and b) I found it curiously vague and confusing. At any rate, it's <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ed2a1b20-2644-11e1-9ed3-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1gad5BdcV">here</a> and it's called "Don't Make Amazon a Monopoly".  <br/>Rob
