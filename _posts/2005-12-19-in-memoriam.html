Along with <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bellow target=_blank>Saul Bellow</a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bunker target=_blank>Edward Bunker</a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Cresswell target=_blank>Helen Cresswell</a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_mcbain target=_blank>Evan Hunter</a> (better known as Ed McBain), <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fowles target=_blank>John Fowles</a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sheckley target=_blank>Robert Sheckley</a> and many others, the King of Gonzo, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson target=_blank>Hunter S. Thompson</a>, died in 2005. 

His suicide in April was accompanied by a note headed <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4227508.stm target=_blank>'Football Season Is Over'</a>, and Johnny Depp paid for his ashes to be fired over his Colorado estate from a <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4168266.stm target=_blank>150-foot cannon in the shape of a clenched fist</a>, but his greatest memorial is undoubtedly the one that begins <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas target=_blank>"We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold..."</a>

Dearly loved and sadly departed authors: Snowbooks salutes you.  <br/><h4></h4>
