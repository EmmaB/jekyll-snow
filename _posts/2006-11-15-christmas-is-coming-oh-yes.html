For anybody who's been wondering: Yes. It's true. Your eyes have not been deceiving you. Snowbooks is sponsoring the lights on Regents Street in London's Famous Weste Ende this Christmas. And, in fact, all snow-related decorations, Christmas or otherwise, everywhere, forever. Thank 'ee, thank 'ee, one and all &c.
