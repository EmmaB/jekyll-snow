The Pentonvile Toad is a mythical beast - pictured here for the first time - that preys on those who are weakened by cold and whose abilities to type are therefore hampered. From the Gallic "Pentonville Eoad", its preferred habitat is a small office on the Pentonville Road where, coincidentally, a small publisher called Snowbooks resides. It is usually spotted when Emma Barnes is typing her office address into yet another webform and she is either in too much of a rush or her fingers are cold. 

Next week: put another lump of coal on the fire, won't you? Summer is over.  <br/>Emma
