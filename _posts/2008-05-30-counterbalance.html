Although I no longer have any <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/05/glubglub.html">standing water</a> in my house, it's still not as easy to get excited about things today as it sometimes is. And what with the recent posts about <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/05/battling_misanthropy.html">Life After People</a> and the shortsighted desire to keep the <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/05/out_real_priorities.html">fossil fuel taps wide open</a> it's easy to let an element of wistfulness creep into one's vibe. Looking at the picture to the left helps a little (click it for a decent-sized version). A nice shiny gadget. Taking a picture of itself on another planet. Another planet. It's NASA's <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1094.html">Image of the Day</a>. Thanks, NASA. Assuming you're not investigating Mars because you want to strip mine it or bomb it or something, then I can happily bask in the nobility of your pioneering spirit.  <br/>Rob
