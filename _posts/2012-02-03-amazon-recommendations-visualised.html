Well, it's not exactly Amazon's recommendations (which have always been abysmally wide of the mark in my case) that someone has chosen to make into giant interactive pictures; it's information contained in the '<span style="font-family: courier;">Customers who bought this item also bought</span>' links. Why not take a look <a href="http://www.yasiv.com/amazon#/Search?q=1Q84&category=Books">here</a> at the interconnected cloud of books. I can see a tool like this being very useful for figuring out what to read next.
