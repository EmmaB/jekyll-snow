Eee! Hello Mr Godin, sir. Thank you for leaving a comment <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/weblog/2008/03/seth_godin_god.html#comments">on here today</a>. Erm, thanks for the amazing <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">blog </a>and for being so clever about stuff. (Never meet your heroes - you always say stupid things.)  Seriously - talk about walking the talk. In his piece that I linked to earlier today, he spoke about how great it would be if people he was a die-hard fan of would get in touch, say thanks, ask his advice on what product to bring out next. And then he got in touch with me, a die-hard fan, and said hi. If I was a big fan before, I'm a proselytizer now. 

On to other matters. To make up for all that starstruck squeeing, here's a handy dandy video about a natty function in Excel, called the VLookup. It'll save you hours if you do naughty things like manually complete Excel forms.
